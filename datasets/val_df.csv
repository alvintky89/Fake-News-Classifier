"Bobby Jindal, raised Hindu, uses story of Christian conversion to woo evangelicals for potential 2016 bid A dozen politically active pastors came here for a private dinner Friday night to hear a conversion story unique in the context of presidential politics: how Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal traveled from Hinduism to Protestant Christianity and, ultimately, became what he calls an “evangelical Catholic.”

Over two hours, Jindal, 42, recalled talking with a girl in high school who wanted to “save my soul,” reading the Bible in a closet so his parents would not see him and feeling a stir while watching a movie during his senior year that depicted Jesus on the cross.

“I was struck, and struck hard,” Jindal told the pastors. “This was the Son of God, and He had died for our sins.”

Jindal’s session with the Christian clergy, who lead congregations in the early presidential battleground states of Iowa and South Carolina, was part of a behind-the-scenes effort by the Louisiana governor to find a political base that could help propel him into the top tier of Republican candidates seeking to run for the White House in 2016.

Known in GOP circles mostly for his mastery of policy issues such as health care, Jindal, a Rhodes Scholar and graduate of the Ivy League’s Brown University, does not have an obvious pool of activist supporters to help drive excitement outside his home state. So he is harnessing his religious experience in a way that has begun to appeal to parts of the GOP’s influential core of religious conservatives, many of whom have yet to find a favorite among the Republicans eyeing the presidential race.

Other potential 2016 GOP candidates are wooing the evangelical base, including Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.

But over the weekend in Lynchburg — a mecca of sorts for evangelicals as the home of Liberty University, founded in the 1970s by the Rev. Jerry Falwell — Jindal appeared to make progress.

In addition to his dinner with the pastors, he delivered a well-received “call to action” address to 40,000 Christian conservatives gathered for Liberty’s commencement ceremony, talking again about his faith while assailing what he said was President Obama’s record of attacking religious liberty.

The pastors who came to meet Jindal said his intimate descriptions of his experiences stood out.

“He has the convictions, and he has what it takes to communicate them,” said Brad Sherman of Solid Rock Christian Church in Coralville, Iowa. Sherman helped former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee in his winning 2008 campaign for delegates in Iowa.

Another Huckabee admirer, the Rev. C. Mitchell Brooks of Second Baptist Church in Belton, S.C., said Jindal’s commitment to Christian values and his compelling story put him “on a par” with Huckabee, who was a Baptist preacher before entering politics.

The visiting pastors flew to Lynchburg over the weekend at the invitation of the American Renewal Project, a well-funded nonprofit group that encourages evangelical Christians to engage in the civic arena with voter guides, get-out-the-vote drives and programs to train pastors in grass-roots activism. The group’s founder, David Lane, has built a pastor network in politically important states such as Iowa, Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina and has led trips to Israel with Paul and others seeking to make inroads with evangelical activists.

The group that Lane invited to Lynchburg included Donald Wild­mon, a retired minister and founder of the American Family Association, a prominent evangelical activist group that has influence through its network of more than 140 Christian radio stations.

Most of the pastors that Lane’s organization brought to Lynchburg had not met Jindal. But they said he captured their interest recently when he stepped forward to defend Phil Robertson, patriarch of the “Duck Dynasty” television-show family, amid a controversy over disparaging remarks he made about gays in an interview with GQ magazine.

Throughout his Lynchburg visit, Jindal presented himself as a willing culture warrior.

During his commencement address Saturday, he took up the cause of twin brothers whose HGTV reality series about renovating and reselling houses, “Flip It Forward,” was canceled last week after a Web site revealed that they had protested against same-sex marriage at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte.

The siblings, Jason and David Benham, both Liberty graduates, attended the graduation and a private lunch with Jindal, who called the action against them “another demonstration of intolerance from the entertainment industry.”

“If these guys had protested at the Republican Party convention, instead of canceling their show, HGTV would probably have given them a raise,” Jindal said as the Liberty crowd applauded.

He cited the Hobby Lobby craft store chain, which faced a legal challenge after refusing to provide employees with insurance coverage for contraceptives as required under the Affordable Care Act. Members of the family that owns Hobby Lobby, who have become heroes to many religious conservatives, have said that they are morally opposed to the use of certain types of birth control and that they considered the requirement a violation of their First Amendment right to religious freedom.

The family was “committed to honor the Lord by being generous employers, paying well above minimum wage and increasing salaries four years in a row even in the midst of the enduring recession,” Jindal told the Liberty graduates. “None of this matters to the Obama administration.”

But for the pastors who came to see Jindal in action, the governor’s own story was the highlight of the weekend. And in many ways, he was unlike any other aspiring president these activists had met.

Piyush Jindal was born in 1971, four months after his parents arrived in Baton Rouge, La., from their native India. He changed his name to Bobby as a young boy, adopting the name of a character on a favorite television show, “The Brady Bunch.”

His decision to become a Christian, he told the pastors, did not come in one moment of lightning epiphany. Instead, he said, it happened in phases, growing from small seeds planted over time.

Jindal recalled that his closest friend from grade school gave him a Bible with his name emblazoned in gold on the cover as a Christmas present. It struck him initially as an unimpressive gift, Jindal told the pastors.

“Who in the world would spend good money for a Bible when everyone knows you can get one free in any hotel?” he recalled thinking at the time. “And the gold lettering meant I couldn’t give it away or return it.”

His religious education reached a higher plane during his junior year in high school, he told his dinner audience. He wanted to ask a pretty girl on a date during a hallway conversation, and she started talking about her faith in God and her opposition to abortion. The girl invited him to visit her church.

Jindal said he was skeptical and set out to “investigate all these fanciful claims” made by the girl and other friends. He started reading the Bible in his closet at home. “I was unsure how my parents would react,” he said.

After the stirring moment when he saw Christ depicted on the cross during the religious movie, the Bible and his very existence suddenly seemed clearer to him, Jindal told the pastors.

Jindal did not dwell on his subsequent conversion to Catholicism just a few years later in college, where he said he immersed himself in the traditions of the church.

He touched on it briefly during the commencement address, noting in passing that “I am best described as an evangelical Catholic.” Mostly, he sought to showcase the ways in which he shares values with other Christian conservatives.

“I read the words of Jesus Christ, and I realized that they were true,” Jindal told the graduates Saturday, offering a less detailed accounting of his conversion than he had done the night before with the pastors. “I used to think that I had found God, but I believe it is more accurate to say that He found me.”",0
"May Brexit offer would hurt, cost EU citizens - EU parliament BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May s offer of  settled status  for EU residents is flawed and will leave them with fewer rights after Brexit, the European Parliament s Brexit coordinator said on Tuesday. A family of five could face a bill of 360 pounds to acquire the new status, Guy Verhofstadt told May s Brexit Secretary David Davis in a letter seen by Reuters    a very significant amount for a family on low income . Listing three other concerns for the EU legislature, which must approve any treaty on the March 2019 exit, Verhofstadt told Davis:  Under your proposals, EU citizens will definitely notice a deterioration of their status as a result of Brexit. And the Parliament s aim all along has been that EU citizens, and UK citizens in the EU-27, should notice no difference.  Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, wrote in response to Davis, who had written to him after Parliament complained last week that there remained  major issues  to be settled on the rights of the 3 million EU citizens in Britain. On Tuesday, he told reporters that Parliament was determined that expatriates should not become  victims of Brexit . May had unveiled more details last week of a system aimed at giving people already in Britain a quick and cheap way of asserting their rights to stay there indefinitely. The issue, along with how much Britain owes and the new EU-UK border across Ireland, is one on which the EU wants an outline agreement before opening talks on the future of trade. Verhofstadt said lawmakers were not dismissing British efforts to streamline applications but saw flaws in the nature of  settled status  itself. As well as the cost, which is similar to that of acquiring a British passport, he cited three others: - Europeans should simply  declare  a whole household resident, without needing an  application  process; the burden of proof should be on the British authorities to deny them rights. - more stringent conditions on criminal records could mean some EU residents, including some now with permanent resident status, being deported for failing to gain  settled status . - EU residents would lose some rights to bring relatives to Britain as the new status would give them the same rights as British people, who now have fewer rights than EU citizens.

"Schumer calls on Trump to appoint official to oversee Puerto Rico relief WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Charles Schumer, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate, called on President Donald Trump on Sunday to name a single official to oversee and coordinate relief efforts in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. Schumer, along with Representatives Nydia Velàzquez and Jose Serrano, said a “CEO of response and recovery” is needed to manage the complex and ongoing federal response in the territory, where millions of Americans remain without power and supplies. In a statement, Schumer said the current federal response to Hurricane Maria’s impact on the island had been “disorganized, slow-footed and mismanaged.” “This person will have the ability to bring all the federal agencies together, cut red tape on the public and private side, help turn the lights back on, get clean water flowing and help bring about recovery for millions of Americans who have gone too long in some of the worst conditions,” he said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Democrats contended that naming a lone individual to manage the government’s relief efforts was critical, particularly given that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is already stretched thin from dealing with other crises, such as the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in Texas and the wildfires in California. The severity of the Puerto Rico crisis, where a million people do not have clean water and millions are without power nearly a month after Hurricane Maria made landfall, demand a single person to focus exclusively on relief and recovery, the Democrats said. Forty-nine people have died in Puerto Rico officially, with dozens more missing. The hurricane did extensive damage to the island’s power grid, destroying homes, roads and other vital infrastructure. Now, the bankrupt territory is struggling to provide basic services like running water, and pay its bills. “It’s tragically clear this Administration was caught flat footed when Maria hit Puerto Rico,” said Velàzquez. “Appointing a CEO of Response and Recovery will, at last, put one person with authority in charge to manage the response and ensure we are finally getting the people of Puerto Rico the aid they need.” On Thursday, Trump said the federal response has been a “10” on a scale of one to 10 at a meeting with Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello.  The governor has asked the White House and Congress for at least $4.6 billion in block grants and other types of funding. Senator Marco Rubio called on Congress to modify an $18.7 billion aid package for areas damaged by a recent swath of hurricanes to ensure that Puerto Rico can quickly access the funds. ",0
"No Change Expected for ESPN Political Agenda Despite Huge Subscriber Decline - Breitbart As more and more sports fans turn off ESPN to protest the network’s   social and political agenda, parent company Disney’s decision to extend current CEO Bob Iger’s contract through 2019 means the “world’s leader in sports entertainment” will continue on its merry way of alienating a large segment of Americans. [Breitbart reported in November that ESPN lost 3. 2 million subscribers in just over a year. Moreover, for the last few years the sports network has lost 300, 000 subscribers a month. In October alone, the beleaguered network lost 621, 000 subscribers.   The decision to keep Iger instead of moving in another direction, such as promoting COO Thomas Staggs to the spot, has a number of substantial business implications for ESPN. Awful Announcing reports: From the outside, at least, it seems like Iger is quite satisfied with ESPN’s leadership and with the network’s path on most fronts. Specifically, he’s regularly spoken about how important it is for ESPN to be in “skinny bundles” (including streaming options from Sling, DirecTV and more) and about ESPN’s forthcoming    offering. Those views wouldn’t necessarily be shared by a different CEO Staggs, for example, spoke much more about the importance of the traditional   bundle, so a Disney CEO with his views might focus more on that side, or conversely, another Disney CEO might want ESPN to quickly go into    in a larger way (standalone access to all ESPN content, including TV channels) rather than starting with the   light approach Iger seems to be promoting. Putting those circumstances aside, the crux of ESPN continuing on in its political and social agenda derives from the fact that Iger is a strident lifelong Democrat. One so committed, in fact, that the Disney stalwart   a Hillary Clinton fundraiser last summer along with   supporters such as entertainment Mogul Haim Saban, Chernin Group chairman and CEO Peter Chernin, and entertainment and sports executive Casey Wasserman.  To get an idea of Iger’s taste on social issues, one of his proposed “entertainment” ideas is a filmic version of Girls, a popular television show starring Lena Dunham. Somewhat surprisingly, and to the chagrin of many of his supporters and shareholders, Iger is serving on President Donald Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum council of CEOs. Iger agrees with Trump on shutting down certain tax loopholes and strongly supports lowering corporate tax rates (no surprise there).  Earlier this month, Iger reportedly defended his participation in Trump’s mastermind group, asserting, “I think there is an opportunity for me to express views that I think   …     are of value to the company and its shareholders. ” Insisting that he won’t be   Iger informs that he will be “adversarial to the view of the administration,” which includes “immigration. ” Yet, the CEO argues that claims asserting ESPN is politically slanted are “just a complete exaggeration. ” With that said, it looks like ESPN’s cable subscription downward spiral will persist as long as Iger remains as Disney’s top executive.

"Billionaire Odebrecht in Brazil scandal released to house arrest RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Billionaire Marcelo Odebrecht, the highest-profile executive imprisoned in Brazil s massive graft scandal, was released from jail on Tuesday to continue his sentence for corruption under house arrest, according to a federal court. The former chief executive officer of Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], Latin America s largest construction firm, was arrested in 2015 during an investigation dubbed Car Wash that exposed billions of dollars in kickbacks to politicians and executives at state-run companies in exchange for inflated contracts. Odebrecht was set to travel to Sao Paulo to begin his house arrest under electronic surveillance on Tuesday, according to the federal court in Parana. A representative for the former executive said he remained committed to collaborating with authorities under a leniency deal.  Odebrecht was first sentenced to 19 years in prison in one of the many cases related to Car Wash. That was reduced to 10 years after he signed a leniency deal last December in exchange for paying a nearly $2 billion fine, admitting guilt and providing evidence to authorities. He has already served two-and-a-half years in prison. Under the deal, he must serve another two-and-a-half years under house arrest. He will then be permitted to leave his home for work for another two-and-a-half years. He will then be required to do community service for the rest of his 10-year sentence. Separately Tuesday, Brazil s antitrust watchdog Cade said it was investigating two alleged cartels involved in bidding for Sao Paulo infrastructure projects after receiving information provided by Odebrecht executives.

"U.N. seeks humanitarian pause in Sanaa where streets ""battlegrounds"" GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations called on Monday for a humanitarian pause in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on Tuesday to allow civilians to leave their homes, aid workers to reach them, and the wounded to get medical care. Jamie McGoldrick, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, said in a statement that the streets of Sanaa had become  battlegrounds  and that aid workers  remain in lockdown .  Thus, I call on all parties to the conflict to urgently enable a humanitarian pause on Tuesday 5 December, between 10:00 a.m. and 16:00 p.m. to allow civilians to leave their homes and seek assistance and protection and to facilitate the movement of aid workers to ensure the continuity of life-saving programs,  he said.  McGoldrick warned the warring parties that any deliberate attacks against civilians, and against civilian and medical infrastructure, are  clear violations of international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes .

"Second judge says Clinton email setup may have been in 'bad faith' NEW YORK (Reuters) - A second federal judge has taken the rare step of allowing a group suing for records from Hillary Clinton’s time as U.S. secretary of state to seek sworn testimony from officials, saying there was “evidence of government wrong-doing and bad faith.” The language in Judge Royce Lamberth’s order undercut the Democratic presidential contender’s assertion she was allowed to set up a private email server in her home for her work as the country’s top diplomat and that the arrangement was not particularly unusual. He described Clinton’s email arrangement as “extraordinary” in his order filed on Tuesday in federal district court in Washington. Referring to the State Department, Clinton and Clinton’s aides, he said there had been “constantly shifting admissions by the Government and the former government officials.” Spokesmen for Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The case is a civil matter, but the order adds to the legal uncertainty that has overshadowed Clinton’s campaign to be the Democratic nominee in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The FBI is also conducting a criminal inquiry into the arrangement after it emerged that classified government secrets ended up in Clinton’s unsecured email account. Clinton has said she does not think she will be charged with a crime.  Lamberth’s order granted the request by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group suing the department under open records laws, to gather evidence, including sworn testimony. The group has filed several lawsuits, including one seeking records about the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. “Where there is evidence of government wrong-doing and bad faith, as here, limited discovery is appropriate, even though it is exceedingly rare in FOIA (freedom-of-information) cases,” Lamberth noted in his order. The government is normally given the benefit of the doubt that it properly searched and produced records.  Since the email arrangement came to public knowledge a year ago, the State Department has found itself defending Clinton in scores of lawsuits from groups, individuals and news outlets who say they were wrongly denied access to Clinton’s federal records. Clinton left the department in 2013, but did not return her email records to the government until nearly two years later.  Last month, Judge Emmet Sullivan, who is overseeing a separate Judicial Watch lawsuit over other Clinton-related records, allowed a similar motion for discovery.

"Supreme Court Won’t Hear Appeal From Texas on Voter ID Case - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court rejected on Monday an appeal from Texas officials seeking to restore the state’s strict voter ID law. As is the court’s custom, its brief order in the case, Abbott v. Veasey, No.   gave no reasons for turning down the appeal. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued an unusual statement explaining that the Supreme Court remains free to consider the case after further proceedings in the lower courts. The Texas law, enacted in 2011, requires voters seeking to cast their ballots at the polls to present photo identification, like a Texas driver’s or gun license, a military ID or a passport. Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that the law is racially discriminatory. The Texas law was at first blocked under Section 5 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which required some states and localities with a history of discrimination to obtain federal permission before changing voting procedures. After the Supreme Court effectively struck down Section 5 in 2013 in Shelby County v. Holder, an Alabama case, Texas officials announced that they would start enforcing the ID law. After a   trial in 2014, Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Federal District Court in Corpus Christi struck down the law on Oct. 9 in a   opinion. She said that it had been adopted “with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose” and that its effect was to disenfranchise “a disproportionate number of   and Hispanics. ” In 2015, a   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, vacated part of the ruling concerning the law’s purpose but affirmed the part concerning its effect. Last July, the full Fifth Circuit largely adopted the panel’s distinctions and reasoning, and it returned the case to the trial court to consider an appropriate remedy. Texas officials nonetheless asked the Supreme Court to review the appeals court’s ruling immediately. The people and groups challenging the law, the officials said, “presented no evidence that the law resulted in diminished minority political participation or prevented even a single person from voting. ” The challengers responded that about 600, 000 registered voters in Texas, or about 5 percent of all registered voters in the state, lacked the required forms of ID. The law, they said, “disproportionately affects minority voters at a statistically significant rate. ” On Monday, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the case would be better suited for Supreme Court review after the lower courts completed their work. Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general, said he was disappointed that the court “did not immediately take our case. ” “Chief Justice Roberts made it very clear that the case will be an even stronger posture for Supreme Court review after further proceedings in lower courts,” Mr. Paxton said in a statement. “Texas enacted a common sense voter ID law to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and we will continue to fight for the law. ” J. Gerald Hebert of the Campaign Legal Center, which represents voters challenging the law, said he was pleased that “the justices recognize that this case does not merit review at this time. ” “Texas, which ranks poorly in voter participation, should work to ensure that every eligible voter in the state is able to cast a ballot going forward,” Mr. Hebert said in a statement.",0
"Islamic State driven out of last stronghold in northern Iraq BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces announced on Thursday they had captured Islamic State s last stronghold in northern Iraq, leaving the militant group holed up near the Syrian border as its self-proclaimed  caliphate  shrinks further. The town of Hawija and the surrounding areas fell in an offensive by U.S.-backed Iraqi government troops and Iranian-trained and armed Shi ite paramilitary groups known as Popular Mobilisation. Some fighting took place to the north and east of the town where the militants were surrounded.  With the fall of Hawija, which lies near the Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk, the only area that remains under control of Islamic State in Iraq is a stretch alongside the western border with Syria, where the militant group is also in retreat. The capture of Hawija was a boost for the Iraqi government, which faces a separate crisis in the north of the country, where the Kurdish minority last month voted overwhelmingly in support of independence for their autonomous region. In Hawija, state TV showed footage of Iraqi forces raising flags in one of the town's squares while Humvees patrolled empty streets littered with car wrecks, houses riddled with bullets and shattered storefronts. (Graphics on 'Iraqi Kurds' independence push' - here)  The army s 9th armored division, the Federal Police, the Emergency Response division and ... Popular Mobilisation liberated Hawija,  said a statement from the joint operations commander, Lieutenant-General Abdul Ameer Rasheed Yarallah. Thick black smoke rose from areas surrounding Hawija, from oil wells set on fire by the militants to prevent air detection.   The capture of Hawija brings Iraqi forces into direct contact with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who control Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic region claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Kirkuk shaped up as a flashpoint last month when the KRG included the city in the referendum on Kurdish independence in northern Iraq.   We don t want any aggression or confrontations but the federal authority must be imposed in the disputed areas,  Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told a news conference in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron offered to mediate between the Iraqi government and Kurdish regional authorities, and promised to maintain a military presence there until Islamic State was defeated. The Iraqi government has imposed sanctions in response to the independence vote, but Abadi said he could understand the Kurds   aspirations , provided they were expressed in accordance with the constitution. The outcome of the referendum has raised concerns in Iraq and abroad that a conflict might break out there along ethnic lines, potentially weakening the campaign against Islamic State. Turkey, which is battling a three-decade-old insurgency by its own Kurdish militants, has led regional opposition to the Iraqi Kurds  independence hopes. Stepping up his rhetoric on the issue, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would soon close its border with northern Iraq and shut its air space in response to the referendum. He added that Turkey, Iran and Iraq would jointly decide on closing the flow of oil from northern Iraq, a vital source of earnings for Iraqi Kurdistan. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country has big energy interests in Kurdistan, said it was in no one s interest to cut off oil supplies from the territory.  But Erdogan said that  if a decision will be made on closing oil taps in the region, that will be made by us. Turkey, Iran and Iraq s central government will do so together . Erdogan s stance has been backed by Iran. After meeting Erdogan in Tehran on Wednesday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran and Turkey should prevent the Iraqi Kurds from declaring independence. Relations have been cool between Shi ite Iran and mainly Sunni Turkey. But both have been alarmed by the independence vote, fearing it will encourage separatism among their own Kurdish populations. The Kurds are the region s fourth-largest ethnic group, spread across Iran, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, all of which oppose any moves towards a Kurdish state. Iraq launched an offensive on Sept. 21 to dislodge Islamic State from the Hawija area, where up to 78,000 people were estimated to be trapped, according to the United Nations.  The militants control the border town of al-Qaim and the region surrounding it.  They also hold parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two different sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi ite militias backed by Iran and Russia. Islamic State s cross-border  caliphate  effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, in a grueling battle which lasted nine months. The militants  leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording last week that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. He urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks. ",0
"Senators Propose Giving States Option to Keep Affordable Care Act - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   Several Republican senators on Monday proposed a partial replacement for the Affordable Care Act that would allow states to continue operating under the law if they choose, a proposal meant to appeal to critics and supporters of former President Barack Obama’s signature health law. But the plan was attacked by Democrats as a step back from the Affordable Care Act’s protections, and it was unlikely to win acceptance from conservative Republicans who want to get rid of the law and its tax increases as soon as possible. If anything, the proposal  —   by Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor, and Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican  —   may show how difficult it will be for Republicans to enact a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. Legislation that can pass muster in the more conservative House may not win enough support in the Senate. A bill with broad appeal in the Senate may fail in the House. Under the proposal, states could stay with the Affordable Care Act, or they could receive a similar amount of federal money, which consumers could use to pay for medical care and health insurance. “We are moving the locus of repeal to state government,” Mr. Cassidy said. “States should have the right to choose. ” The proposal shares some features with House Republican proposals: It would encourage greater use of health savings accounts and eliminate the requirement for most Americans to have insurance or pay a tax penalty. But the option for states to keep the Affordable Care Act alive will rankle the most conservative Republicans who have been trying for nearly seven years to blow it up. “Obamacare is flawed, failing and not fixable, and it needs to be fully repealed,” said Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. A stalemate between the House and Senate would leave in place Mr. Obama’s health law, but efforts by President Trump and Congress to undermine it could send health insurance markets into a tailspin. On Friday, as one of his first official acts as president, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that could allow officials to ease up on enforcement of the mandate requiring most Americans to have insurance. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act panned the   proposal. “Millions of Americans would be kicked off their plans,    costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket, and protections for people with   conditions, such as cancer, would be gutted,” said the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York. Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a   consumer group, said the bill “falls way short of providing the protections and coverage people have under the Affordable Care Act. ” Ms. Collins said the bill would allow states to “keep the Affordable Care Act if it is working for their residents. ” But she predicted that most states would choose something different. Under the   bill, states could enroll people who would otherwise be uninsured in health plans providing basic coverage. These   health plans are intended to protect consumers against catastrophic medical expenses. They would cover generic versions of prescription drugs, and they would also have to cover recommended childhood immunizations without  . States would contract with one or more insurers to offer this coverage. Consumers could buy “more robust coverage” if they want, Mr. Cassidy said, but they could be automatically enrolled, by default, in the   health plans providing basic coverage. “A state could say, ‘All those eligible are enrolled unless they choose not to be,’” he explained. This “passive enrollment” would provide insurers with a large pool of customers, including many healthy people, without the coercion of an “individual mandate,” Mr. Cassidy said. “We think that we could cover more people than Obamacare,” Mr. Cassidy said, although he acknowledged that the effects of his bill had not been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, which serves as Capitol Hill’s official scorekeeper. If a state opts out of the Affordable Care Act, many of the federal insurance standards established under the law would no longer apply. The bill would repeal federal benefit mandates that “often force Americans to pay for coverage they don’t need and can’t afford,” Mr. Cassidy said. But some protections would remain in place. Parents would still be allowed to keep children on their insurance until the age of 26, and insurers could not impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits. The   bill, called the Patient Freedom Act, would eliminate not only the unpopular individual mandate, but also the federal requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to   employees. Mr. Cassidy said that Senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Johnny Isakson of Georgia, both Republicans, were also sponsors of the bill. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, were sponsors of a similar bill that Mr. Cassidy introduced in 2015. But the legislative landscape is different now. Republicans in Congress can repeal the Affordable Care Act, with support from Mr. Trump. In the Senate, they will need help from Democrats to adopt a replacement because Republicans are eight votes shy of the 60 needed to stop a filibuster.",0

"Credit Suisse Boss Faces Revolt From Bankers Over Strategy Shift - The New York Times When Tidjane Thiam took over at Credit Suisse last July, he laid out a new direction for a financial giant with a storied investment banking history: Do less investment banking. And he used forceful language in doing so. He has referred to once core businesses  —   such as trading in distressed bonds and derivatives  —   as “ugly ducklings. ” He has suggested publicly that traders increased their investments in risky debt without his knowledge. Instead, Mr. Thiam said, the firm should dedicate itself to cultivating billionaires in China, Indonesia and Africa. The message: The future for the company is in managing the wealth of others. One year in, Credit Suisse stock is down 50 percent. And the investment bank, the second largest in Switzerland after UBS, is in open revolt. Credit Suisse has a wide range of businesses, like overseeing the fortunes of billionaires and managing initial public offerings for technology companies. But for decades, the bank has been dominated, both culturally and financially, by a richly paid banking elite. These deal makers in New York and London are now furious at Mr. Thiam, not just for cutting their pay but also because they resent his blaming them for the $6 billion in losses that the firm has suffered on his watch. Across Europe, banking giants like Barclays, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland have, to varying degrees, moved away from traditional investment banking activities because of increased regulation and volatile markets. Sluggish growth in large European economies  —   not to mention the remarkable phenomenon of negative interest rates  —   have not helped matters, either. But what makes the situation at Credit Suisse stand out is that Mr. Thiam appears to have done little to cloak his disdain for these activities. The question is not whether Mr. Thiam is right to grab power and capital from these declining businesses but whether his blunt, domineering style as a change agent will end up alienating bankers instead of winning them over. “It is never easy to tell people that whole parts of the business that have put bread on their table and bought them a second house have become uneconomic,” said Guy Moszkowski, a longtime securities analyst at Autonomous Research. By any measure, Mr. Thiam is an unconventional choice to lead an investment bank. Born to a prominent family in Ivory Coast, he cut short a career at McKinsey  Company in Paris in 1994 to join a   government in his home country as a top banker and minister. Following a military coup in 1999, Mr. Thiam returned to McKinsey, and in 2009, he was named chief executive of Prudential, the British insurance conglomerate  —   becoming the first African to head a major listed company in Britain.    and snugly tailored, Mr. Thiam has an air about him of not suffering fools. He had a successful run at Prudential (no relation to an American company with a similar name) overcoming an uproar following a failed bid to buy the Asian operations of the American International Group. Along the way, he became one of London’s more celebrated executives and a regular on the circuit of global  . That he has not bent to the complaints of bankers and traders in unprofitable businesses should not come as a surprise. “There needs to be a cultural change,” he said in a televised interview in March, in which he argued that bankers were pursuing risky trades to justify their high pay. “A lot of the problems in the investment bank are that people are trying to generate revenue at all costs. ” In turn, deal makers in London and New York, who have seen their bonuses slashed by nearly 40 percent, are not hiding their dislike of the man. More than any other bank on Wall Street, Credit Suisse restricts the cash portion of its bonuses, allocating large chunks in company stock, which has halved in value. So when their new chief executive gave a speech in May and said that Credit Suisse’s stock price “reflected reality,” bankers, especially the many who have worked at the firm for decades, could not believe it. On Credit Suisse’s newly renovated trading floor in New York, several bankers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, grumbled that Mr. Thiam had “lost the building,” which is Wall Street parlance for chief executives who no longer command the respect of their traders. And when he has appeared on television in recent months, employees loudly vented their frustrations at the screen, according those bankers, who witnessed the events but were not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Thiam was hailed during his first visit to the trading floor in New York last year, but the reception during a more recent appearance was chillier, said two employees who were on the floor during his visits but were not authorized to speak publicly. In particular, many at Credit Suisse find Mr. Thiam’s personal style to be jarring at a time when thousands are being laid off and the stock is trading at a multiyear low. This is particularly true when compared with Brady W. Dougan, his   predecessor: Mr. Thiam’s own dealings with the media are handled by a British firm, Powerscourt. He enjoys a robust social life and has been seen doing the rounds at clubs in London and Davos, Switzerland. And he recently purchased a luxury home in Herrliberg, an exclusive lakeside enclave in Zurich. To be sure, analysts agree that Credit Suisse can no longer rely on trading derivatives with firms like Deutsche Bank as a profit center. Instead, Mr. Thiam is encouraging his deal makers to support the firm’s private bankers in Asia, by providing loans to   magnates in Indonesia or helping billionaire clients in China with initial public offerings. Mr. Thiam is clearly enamored with the prospect of tapping growth markets in emerging economies. He has been to China and broader Asia at least four times in his new capacity, and his business cards carry a Mandarin translation on the back. Mr. Thiam’s defenders say that with the future of Credit Suisse in doubt, he has no choice but to make these painful changes and that resistance from   traders and bankers should not deter him. And it is also true that wealth managers in Switzerland and Asia, where Mr. Thiam is adding resources, are embracing the new strategy. Following last year’s losses, he also asked his board for a 40 percent cut in his bonus, taking in $4. 5 million for the six months he worked last year. To date, the Credit Suisse board appears to be standing with Mr. Thiam. Indeed, having had two Wall Street chiefs since 2001, the board clearly believes that only a prominent nonbanker like Mr. Thiam can wean the firm off a line of business that has so long defined it. Nevertheless, directors were not happy with his televised comments in March when Mr. Thiam suggested that traders at the bank were hiding losses from him. Mr. Thiam quickly corrected himself at a conference that same day and said no limits were breached, though not without taking another dig at his traders by questioning their judgment. Mr. Thiam also called these   traders and offered what a spokeswoman for the bank said was a “clarification” of his remarks. “The board is 100 percent behind the strategy, Tidjane and the executive board,” said Richard E. Thornburgh, a former Credit Suisse banker with 30 years of experience at the firm who is now chairman of the board’s risk committee. With morale in New York at a low point, Mr. Thornburgh has had recent meetings with top bankers and traders, hearing them out and urging them to remain focused on their clients. For many, though, this is easier said than done. It is unusual, after all, for an incoming chief executive to be so publicly critical of employees responsible for a quarter of a firm’s revenue. That is particularly true on Wall Street, where punctured vanities can quickly harm a firm, as productive bankers head for the exits in droves. Over the last six months, at least 18 bankers and traders have left the firm, with many of these coming from Credit Suisse’s once prestigious technology unit in San Francisco. The culture clash at Credit Suisse recalls a similar dispute at Morgan Stanley a decade ago. Like Mr. Thiam, Philip J. Purcell was a former whiz kid consultant from McKinsey who preferred slow and steady brokers over bankers with big egos and even bigger paychecks. A   uprising forced Mr. Purcell’s departure, since power on Wall Street was then still in the hands of deal makers and traders. With wealth managers now ascendant, Mr. Thiam seems willing to accept the wounded cries of his own bankers as a painful necessity if his grand plan is to succeed. “Is there a vision. Is there a direction?” Mr. Thiam asked aloud last year in a speech introducing his strategy. “The Germans say that the horrible end is better than horror without end. ”",0
"Schaeuble to head German parliament, unblocking coalition talks BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany took a first decisive step on Wednesday toward forming a new government when its veteran finance minister, conservative Wolfgang Schaeuble, agreed to become president of the parliament, clearing the way for another party to take his job. Chancellor Angela Merkel will hope that Schaeuble, deeply respected in Germany for helping to steer the euro zone through its debt crisis, can stamp his authority on a fractious Bundestag lower house that will include two more parties after Sunday s federal election. Merkel must assemble Germany s first three-way coalition since the 1950s after her conservatives lost support and a far-right party, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), entered parliament for the first time in half a century. In a sign of the challenges ahead, Andrea Nahles, the Social Democrats  newly elected parliamentary leader, told reporters her party would hit conservatives  squarely in the jaw  after four years as junior partner in a Merkel-led  grand coalition . Merkel s most realistic coalition option now is a deal with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus, and the Greens. But the parties disagree on issues such as energy, Europe and migration, complicating the path to a so-called  Jamaica  coalition - a reference to the parties  colors:  black, yellow and green, which are also those of the Jamaican flag. Schaeuble, 75, who emerged as one of Europe s most influential politicians during the euro zone crisis, will bring unprecedented weight to the role of Bundestag president, normally a low-profile position. His willingness to quit as finance minister after eight years in the post makes it easier for the FDP to join a Merkel-led coalition. The FDP, who are as fiscally hawkish as Schaeuble, have said they want his old job.  As an outstanding personality Wolfgang Schaeuble possesses a natural authority that is of particular importance in these times,  said FDP leader Christian Lindner, himself seen as a likely successor at the finance ministry. Lindner s deputy, Wolfgang Kubicki, another possible candidate for the post, told the RND newspaper chain that Schaeuble s move showed Merkel s openness to a  Jamaica  coalition. He also underscored his party s call for a shift in fiscal policy. Schaeuble was criticized in southern Europe, especially Greece, for his insistence on tax hikes and spending cuts at a time of deep recession, but is popular at home for balancing the books and presiding over high growth and low unemployment. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, speaking in Munich, said he did not think Schaeuble s departure would soften the EU s approach to heavily indebted Greece.  The austerity measures will be continued by those who carried them out together with Wolfgang Schaeuble,  he said. The Free Democrats, with a voter support base among Germany s small and medium-sized businesses, are as committed to budgetary discipline as Schaeuble but less pro-European, meaning Wednesday s news drew a mixed reception from the euro zone.  I don t think there will be radical changes in German economic policy if the FDP replaces him,  said one official close to euro zone policy-making.  The FDP are also hardliners on deficits.  But another euro zone official said the euro zone was losing  one of the most pro-European politicians I know  and instead getting a party markedly cooler on political integration. Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told the Handelsblatt newspaper he would miss Schaeuble s steady hand.  Wolfgang Schaeuble was a loyal discussion partner, serious, competent and also a good friend,  he said. Merkel emerged from Sunday s election a weakened figure  after her conservatives, still the largest bloc in the Bundestag, bled support to the AfD. But the exit of Schaeuble, the most powerful counterweight to the long-serving chancellor, could paradoxically strengthen her position. As Bundestag president, Schaeuble will not be involved in coalition negotiations, removing one strong-minded negotiator from the table and potentially giving Merkel a freer hand. Coalition negotiations will only begin in earnest after Oct. 15, when the conservatives hope to wrest power from the Social Democrats in a state election in Lower Saxony. By law, the new parliament must convene for its first session 30 days after the election, so by Oct. 24 at the latest. ",0
"At U.S.-China summit, Trump presses Xi on trade, North Korea; progress cited PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to curb North Korea’s nuclear program and help reduce the gaping U.S. trade deficit with Beijing in talks on Friday, even as he toned down the strident anti-China rhetoric of his election campaign. Trump spoke publicly of progress on a range of issues in his first U.S.-China summit – as did several of his top aides – but they provided few concrete specifics other than China’s agreement to work together to narrow disagreements and find common ground for cooperation. As the two leaders wrapped up a Florida summit overshadowed by U.S. missile strikes in Syria overnight, Xi joined Trump in stressing the positive mood of the meetings while papering over deep differences that have caused friction between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump’s aides insisted he had made good on his pledge to raise concerns about China’s trade practices and said there was some headway, with Xi agreeing to a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports and reducing China’s trade surplus with the United States. Speaking after the two-day summit at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said that Xi had agreed to increased cooperation in reining in North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs – though he did not offer any new formula for cracking Pyongyang’s defiant attitude.  Trump had promised during the campaign to stop what he called the theft of American jobs by China. Many blue-collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory on Nov. 8 and Trump is under pressure to deliver for them. The Republican president tweeted last week that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses and that his meeting with Xi “will be a very difficult one.”  On Friday, the unpredictable Trump not only set a different tone but also avoided any public lapses in protocol that Chinese officials had feared could embarrass their leader. “We have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China,” Trump told reporters as the two delegations met around tables flanked by large U.S. and Chinese flags. “We will be making additional progress. The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding. “And I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,” he added, without providing details. Xi also spoke in mostly positive terms. “We have engaged in deeper understanding, and have built a trust,” he said. “I believe we will keep developing in a stable way to form friendly relations ... For the peace and stability of the world, we will also fulfill our historical responsibility.” “Well, I agree with you 100 percent,” Trump replied. China’s official Xinhua news agency said Xi had encouraged the United States to take part in the “One Belt, One Road” plan, Xi’s signature foreign policy imitative aimed at infrastructure development across Asia, Africa and Europe, seen in some policy circles as a partial answer to the pivot to Asia strategy of Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama. Xi also hailed military to military exchanges and said China and the United States should “make good use of the dialogue mechanism to be established between the two countries’ joint staffs of the armed forces”, although Xinhua did not give further details. Chinese state media on Saturday cheered the meeting as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable and established the tone for the development of U.S.-China relations. But in a sign that rough spots remained, Tillerson afterwards described the discussions as “very frank and candid.” “President Trump and President Xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respect,” he said. After the meeting, Trump took Xi on a walk around the manicured grounds of his lavish Spanish-style complex. Trump could be seen chatting and gesturing to Xi, who did the same. Tillerson said Trump had accepted Xi’s invitation to visit China and that they also agreed to upgrade a U.S.-China dialogue by putting the two presidents at the head of the forum. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Chinese had expressed an interest in reducing China’s trade surplus as a way of controlling their own inflation. “That’s the first time I’ve heard them say that in a bilateral context,” he said. Ross declined to say whether the United States was ready to designate China a currency manipulator, however, referring to an upcoming report in which that issue would be addressed. Although Trump during the presidential election campaign had pledged to label China a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration, he has refrained from doing so.  The highly anticipated U.S.-China summit was upstaged by U.S. missile strikes overnight against a Syrian air base from which Trump said a deadly chemical weapon attack had been launched earlier in the week. It was the first direct U.S. assault on the Russian-backed government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in six years of civil war.  The swift action in Syria could be interpreted as a signal especially to defiant nuclear-armed North Korea – and by extension, its ally China – as well as other countries like Iran and Russia of Trump’s willingness to use military force. North Korea is developing missiles capable of hitting the United States. Tillerson said Xi agreed with Trump that North Korea’s nuclear advances had reached a “very serious stage.” He said Trump also raised U.S.concerns about China’s activities in the South China Sea. Beijing is building and fortifying islands in pursuit of expansive territorial claims in the strategic waterway. ",0
"Clinton extends lead over Trump to 7 points: Reuters/Ipsos NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s lead over Republican rival Donald Trump increased to more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from less than 3 points on Thursday. The shift came as Trump struggled to reset his campaign following a stretch of controversies. About 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton and about 35 percent preferred Trump, according to the Aug. 4-8 online poll of 1,152 likely voters, which had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The others would either pick another candidate, would not vote, or “don’t know/refused.” The results reflected a decline in support for Trump, rather than a boost for Clinton: In last Thursday’s poll, 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton and about 39 percent favored Trump. Among registered voters over the same period, Clinton held a lead of nearly 13 percentage points, up from about 5 percentage points on Thursday, according to the poll.  The five-day survey concluded on a mixed day for the Trump campaign. After squabbles last week with party leaders and the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq, Trump sought to turn the page with a speech outlining an economic platform of tax breaks and regulatory rollbacks.  But in what was surely unwelcome news for Trump’s campaign, 50 heavyweight Republican national security officials, in a letter published on Monday, said that Trump would be “the most reckless president in American history.” Trump hit back, saying the signatories “deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.” Trump faced more dissent within his party on Monday. A former CIA officer, Evan McMullin, announced he would run as an independent alternative to Trump for conservative Republicans, and Republican Senator Susan Collins said she would not vote for Trump. In a separate Reuters/Ipsos survey that gave respondents the option to choose from Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton leads Trump by about 6 percentage points. Of the alternative party candidates, Johnson came in third with nearly 8 percentage points, up from 6 points on Thursday. Stein has about 2 percentage points. The Aug. 4-8 survey of 1,154 likely voters had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. McMullin was not an option in the poll. ",0
"Iran, Russia and Turkey Agree to Enforce Syria Cease-Fire, but Don’t Explain How - The New York Times ASTANA, Kazakhstan  —   Two days of talks over the Syrian civil war concluded on Tuesday with an agreement by Iran, Russia and Turkey to enforce a fragile partial  . But neither the Syrian government nor the rebel fighters  —   who briefly met face to face for the first time in nearly six years of war  —   signed the agreement. While the three powers agreed to establish a mechanism to monitor and enforce the nearly     they did not say what the mechanism should look like, deferring that issue for now. The statement, at least on paper, brought Iran on board with recent new cooperation between Russia and Turkey, and it strengthened Turkey’s commitment to separating rebel groups it supports from jihadist groups. But representatives of the Syrian delegations  —   both from the government and opposition  —   immediately expressed reservations. They emphasized that they had not signed on to a document that had been brokered by the main sponsors of the warring sides in the country, but not by Syrians themselves. Russia is the most powerful backer of the Syrian government, which is also closely allied with Iran, while Turkey has been among the main supporters of rebel groups. Despite the supposed   new clashes were reported in Wadi Barada, a besieged   area and source for most of the drinking water for Damascus, the Syrian capital. Water supplies have been cut off for weeks, and the government and rebel sides have blamed each other. The agreement among Iran, Russia and Turkey was announced a day after the Syrian factions exchanged harsh words at the start of the talks, held in Astana, capital of Kazakhstan. A main result of the meeting was to firm up Russia’s growing role in the Syria diplomacy, establishing the Astana talks as a part of, but not a replacement for, the Geneva process that has been spearheaded for years by the United Nations and the United States. The new document said meetings in Astana, a capital five time zones east of Geneva with close ties to Turkey but firmly within Russia’s sphere of influence, would be a forum to discuss specific issues that come up within the Geneva framework. There had been tentative hopes among some rebel negotiators that Russia might be ready to take on a more active role in seeking a political compromise. But there was no concrete progress on political issues, which were excluded from the narrowly focused talks. Iran, Russia and Turkey affirmed their commitment “to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic as a multiethnic, multireligious, nonsectarian and democratic state,” and their conviction “that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict and that it can only be solved through a political process. ” Those sentiments echo principles that the United Nations Security Council has laid out. The countries also reiterated “their determination to fight jointly” against the Islamic State and against Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, formerly known as the Nusra Front, pledging to “separate” them from armed opposition groups. That could be an important provision, since the Syrian government led by President Bashar   tends to classify all the opposition fighters indiscriminately as terrorist groups, and many have been unable or unwilling to separate themselves from forces of the former Nusra Front on the battlefield. The agreement did not specify how such a separation might occur, however. In Astana, government representatives said that they still considered the rebel fighters to be terrorists and were waiting to see if Turkey followed through on the agreement. Rebel negotiators said the meetings had given them hope that Russia might be open to hearing rebel concerns and become more willing to press the Syrian government for a political resolution, but such optimism did not extend to Iran, which had stuck to a harder line. Staffan de Mistura, the special United Nations envoy for Syria who had been invited to the Astana talks, said in an interview after the joint statement was issued that in the interactions he had watched between Russia and opposition commanders, “The body language was of people who were seriously talking to each other and taking each other seriously. ” At the same time, rebels are concerned that the new agreement puts Iran in the position of taking part in a   that its own militias have been accused of violating. The next round of talks between the Syrian government and the opposition will occur on Feb. 8 in Geneva, according to the announcement by the three countries. But diplomats in Astana said it was unclear if that date was firm. Bashar   the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations who led his government’s delegation to the talks in Astana, said an offensive by the government and its allied troops would continue, arguing that   “terrorist groups” controlled Ain   a town in Wadi Barada. Residents in Wadi Barada say that some fighters from the former Nusra Front are present there, but that they are at most a tiny minority. Also on Tuesday, United Nations officials appealed for more than $8 billion in funding this year to help millions of people displaced by the Syrian conflict. The United Nations refugee agency is asking for $4. 6 billion to help at least 4. 8 million people who have fled abroad, mainly to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, and around $3. 4 billion for an estimated 13. 5 million internally displaced Syrians.",0
"Trump says Brexit to be 'a great thing', wants quick trade deal with UK LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said that Brexit would turn out to be a great thing and other countries would follow Britain out of the European Union but promised to strike a swift bilateral trade deal with the United Kingdom. Speaking in an interview with The Times of London newspaper five days before his inauguration, Trump described himself as a big fan of Britain and endorsed last year’s vote to leave the European Union. “I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing,” Trump said. “I’ll tell you, the fact that your pound sterling has gone down? Great. Because business is unbelievable in a lot of parts in the UK.” The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. Sterling has since fallen further against the U.S. dollar as traders, businesses and investors fret about the type of relationship Britain will have with its biggest single trading partner after it leaves the bloc. Trump’s election campaign seized on the Brexit vote as an example of disillusioned voters rising up against the political establishment, and he forged a friendship with leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage - a fierce critic of Prime Minister Theresa May. Trump’s election has raised questions over the future of the so called ‘special relationship’ that has underpinned close British-American ties for decades. But in Sunday’s interview Trump played up his ancestral ties to Britain, saying his Scottish mother was “so proud” of Queen Elizabeth, and said he was eager to get a trade deal done. “We’re gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly. Good for both sides,” Trump said. “I will be meeting with [May]. She’s requesting a meeting and we’ll have a meeting right after I get into the White House ... we’re gonna get something done very quickly.” However, he predicted that more countries would seek to follow Britain’s example and quit the EU. “I believe others will leave,” he said. “If refugees keep pouring into different parts of Europe . . . I think it’s gonna be very hard to keep it together because people are angry about it.” He singled out German Chancellor Angela Merkel - whose open-door policies have allowed about 1.1 million refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere into Germany since mid-2015 - calling her immigration policy a catastrophic mistake.

"Mayday on the Carolina Queen - The New York Times The seven fishermen aboard the Carolina Queen III, a   scalloping boat that set out from Norfolk, Va. had been at sea for four days when the skies darkened off the coast of the Rockaways. A powerful storm system that had already lashed the East Coast, bringing tornadoes, thunder, lightning, high winds and heavy rains, was barreling down on them. Homes had been flattened, vehicles had been tossed like Tinkertoys and trees had been ripped from their roots. At least seven people had died. The crew knew they were in for nasty weather, but they were scallopers. Weather comes with the job. As night fell on Feb. 24, the winds started to blow across New York City. At 8:45 p. m. a large section of a facade collapsed on Fordham Street in the Bronx. At 9:19, a   was blown over on the upper level of the George Washington Bridge. By midnight, there were reports of downed trees and power lines around the region. Off the coast, winds were gusting up to 69 miles an hour, according to data collected by the National Weather Service. The men on the Carolina Queen had a decision to make. One successful   scalloping trip can pull in a profit of $500, 000. Each fisherman can make $40, 000 on a good voyage. The crew was   fishing, about 30 miles off the coast, as the storm approached. The men decided to steer the vessel closer to shore  —   past a predetermined demarcation line that would stop the clock on their allotted   yearly limit at sea. The Carolina Queen had only 50 bags of scallops  —   60 pounds per bag  —   on ice in the hold. With the scallop season drawing to a close, this trip was the crew’s last chance for a major haul. When the skies cleared, they expected, they would get back to business. But shortly after 2 a. m. on Feb. 25, the vessel, battered by wind and waves, ran aground. Soon, one of its generators failed and the Carolina Queen issued a desperate mayday, setting in motion a harrowing rescue operation. In the next few hours, a Coast Guard boat capsized and Fire Department vessels were unable to reach the stranded scallop boat because of the weather. Ultimately, the Coast Guard decided to undertake a daring airlift operation by a crew dispatched from Atlantic City. “Nothing about this really was routine,” said Deputy Chief George Healy of the New York Fire Department. “This was a very treacherous operation. ” The airmen and women at Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City keep a goldfish in their “survival shop,” where they gear up before missions. The swimmer, as they call it, is named Ashton, a reference to Ashton Kutcher in his role as a Coast Guard rescue swimmer in the widely mocked,   2006 movie “The Guardian”  —   and a wry acknowledgment that the Coast Guard is not always accorded the kind of respect reserved for other branches of the military. But the Coast Guard plays a vital role in protecting the nation’s maritime interests. Since it was absorbed into the Department of Homeland Security, combating terrorism has been added to the sprawling mission carried out by its 88, 000   reserve, civilian and auxiliary men and women serving around the world. Despite the expanded responsibilities, its budget has been buffeted in his 2015 State of the Coast Guard Address, Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, the Coast Guard commandant, said 40 percent of the acquisition budget had been slashed over the previous four years. “I’m concerned that aging platforms and crumbling infrastructure continue to hinder mission success,” Admiral Zukunft said. “Today we’re seeing significant increase in demand across all of our daily activities, and it limits our ability to respond to major contingencies. Indeed, we are facing a time like none other in our nearly 225 years of service. ” Air Coast Guard Station Atlantic City, at the William J. Hughes Federal Aviation Administration Technical Center at the Atlantic City International Airport, is the closest air station to New York City. It was formed in 1998 when Coast Guard Air Station Brooklyn and Group Air Station Cape May, New Jersey, were merged. The squadron comprises 10   Dolphin helicopters. Its crews are responsible for covering hundreds of miles of coastline in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia  —   as well as interior bays and rivers such as Chesapeake Bay, the Delaware and Hudson Rivers and Long Island Sound. Two helicopters are always ready to be airborne within 30 minutes. Lt. Mark Bruno, 31, was the aircraft commander on duty on Feb. 25 when the call came in that a fishing vessel off the coast of the Rockaways was in trouble. At 4:30 a. m. his team was dispatched to New York City. The Dolphin helicopter can fly faster than 160 m. p. h. but it would still take about 45 minutes to reach the Carolina Queen. The helicopter crew members  —   including Lt. j. g. Maggie Champlin, 32, the   Petty Officer Second Class Kensuke Caldwell, 34, the flight mechanic and Petty Officer Third Class Joe   27, the rescue swimmer  —   took off in darkness shortly before 5 a. m. knowing very little about what they might find. “We knew it was a fishing vessel, and fishing vessels are always tricky,” Lieutenant Bruno said. There are lines and riggings to contend with, and there often is very little room for error, especially when trying to pluck someone off the deck. And it can be more complicated when the vessel is no longer afloat. “Normally, when a boat is on the waves, it has a certain rhythm,” Lieutenant Bruno said. That is not the case when it has run aground. As the crew sped north, it was in communication with the Fire Department, which arrived on the scene shortly before 5 a. m. It was soon clear that this would not be a straightforward operation. The first distress signal to the outside world from the Carolina Queen was an emergency flare that lit up the sky shortly after 4:30 a. m. Aaron Bell, 25, a UPS worker who lives in an apartment near the water on Beach 56th Place in Queens, said it was so windy and foggy “you couldn’t even see the ocean” from the shore. But someone spotted the flare. Chief Healy said the first 911 call came in at 4:42 a. m. Emergency responders were on the scene at 4:47. Chief Healy has 25 years on the job. He has seen all sorts of disasters and is not one for overstatement. The ship was not more than 80 yards from shore. But once contact was made with those on board, it was clear that the ship and its crew were in dire trouble. “We directed the captain and crew to put on exposure suits,” Chief Healy said. “We had a fear that the boat was going to capsize. ” Waves were cresting as high as 14 feet and breaking on the ship. The scallopers were as stranded as they might have been in the open ocean. As the Fire Department was responding, a   Coast Guard rescue boat was also racing to the scene. Dispatched by Coast Guard Station Jones Beach, the boat capsized in the rough waters near East Rockaway Inlet before it reached the Carolina Queen. Its crew members had to save themselves, swimming to shore. The team aboard the helicopter learned of that accident as they made their way up the coast. “You get a little nervous hearing that,” Lieutenant Bruno said. “But it was good to know they were safe. ” That part of the incident is still under investigation the Coast Guard declined to answer questions about what might have gone wrong. The Fire Department had rescue boats to deploy, but the seas were so severe that the F. D. N. Y. decided to wait for air support. A Fire Department helicopter, only a short distance away at Floyd Bennett Field, was grounded because of the heavy fog. The crew of the Carolina Queen would have to wait. Scallop fishing may not conjure up the   of those catching crabs in the icy waters of the Bering Strait or the exploits of   tuna fisherman chronicled on shows like “The Deadliest Catch. ” But the most dangerous fishing grounds in America remain those off the Northeast Coast  —   more dangerous than the Bering Sea, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2000 to 2009, the years covered by the agency’s data, 504 people died while fishing at sea and 124 of them were in the Northeast. The scallop industry had the   rate of fatalities: 425 deaths per 100, 000 workers. Among all workers in the United States over the same period, according to the C. D. C. there were four deaths per 100, 000 workers. The size of the crew and the time at sea contribute to the dangers. Drew Minkiewicz, a lawyer who represents the Fisheries Survival Fund, said that since 2010, the number of vessels permitted to fish for scallops has been limited, and with fewer unregistered ships at sea, there have been fewer accidents. The Atlantic sea scallop  —   Placopecten magellanicus  —   has been popular since the 1950s, when Norwegian immigrants first scoured the seas south of New Bedford, Mass. The supply could swing between scarcity and plenty, but in the 1980s huge algae blooms known as brown tides appeared several years in a row and threatened to destroy the scallops’ ecosystem on the East Coast. Even after those tides passed, the industry almost did itself in by overfishing. Only after regulations were passed in the 1990s and the industry banded together with the scientific community to improve fishing techniques did the fisheries rebound. Now, scalloping along the Atlantic Coast from Maine to North Carolina is among the most lucrative fishing in the world. In 2014, the catch was estimated to be worth more than $424 million. Most of the ships that fish these waters are registered with the National Marine Fisheries Service, including the Carolina Queen. The ship is owned by the Wells Scallop Company, a   family operation that stretches back four generations. Bill Wells, who runs the company, declined to talk about the incident. Through an industry spokesman, he said he wanted to thank both the Coast Guard and the New York City emergency responders and said that the incident had been classified as an accident, with no fault found on the part of the crew and no fines issued against his company. The industry operates under strict guidelines, many aimed at ensuring sustainability of the fisheries. To fish some areas with known scallop beds, a permit is needed, and the haul is capped.   fishing, on the other hand, is restricted only by the annual     limit. The clock is always ticking. “We get so few days to go out, we have to find every efficiency to maximize our days at sea,” said Joe Gilbert, who owns Empire Fisheries and, as captain of a boat called the Rigulus, is part of the   scalloping community. In preparation for the Carolina Queen’s voyage, the crew would have spent days getting ready, buying $3, 000 in groceries, loading more than 20, 000 pounds of ice and prepping the equipment on the   vessel. The vessel steamed north from the Chesapeake Bay, traveling 15 hours to reach the coast off New Jersey, where the crew would probably have started fishing. Then the work would begin. It is pretty standard for a crew to work eight hours on and take four hours off, but in reality it often is more like nine hours on and three off. If you are a good sleeper, you are lucky to get two hours’   before heading back on deck. The huge tows scouring the ocean bed for scallops dredge for about 50 minutes and are then hauled up, their catch dumped on deck before the tows are reset and plunged back into the water, a process that can be done in as little as 10 minutes. While the dredge did its work, the crew on duty on the Carolina Queen sorted through the muddy mix of rocks and sand and other flotsam on the ship’s deck, looking for the wavy round shells of the scallops. “The biggest danger is handling the gear on deck,” Mr. Gilbert said. “It is very heavy gear on a pitching deck, and you get a lot of injured feet, injured hands. ” Once the scallops are sorted, according to industry regulations, they must be shucked by hand. The crew spends hours opening the shells and slicing out the abductor muscle of the mollusks  —   the fat, tasty morsel that winds up on plates at a restaurants like Oceana in Midtown Manhattan, where a plate of sea scallops à la plancha costs as much as $33. A single boat can haul 4, 000 pounds in a day. By the time the Carolina Queen ran aground, it was carrying only around 3, 000 pounds. As the Coast Guard helicopter circled overhead, however, the scallops on ice below deck were not the most pressing concern. It was around 5:30 a. m. “It was definitely a dangerous situation they were in,” Lieutenant Bruno said. “They had lost their generator and were taking on water, and I think that is when they made the decision that they had to come off. ” But how? As the helicopter approached the Rockaways, the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Fire Department on shore, had come up with a plan. By then there were dozens of emergency workers on the beach. Petty Officer   the rescue swimmer, would be lowered into the surf to assess the situation, and if all went well, swim each stranded fisherman to shore. The fog was still thick as the helicopter made its first sweeping pass overhead. Circling around a second time, the fog had cleared enough to put Petty Officer   into the water. Petty Officer   had joined the Coast Guard knowing he wanted to become a rescue swimmer. He had made up his mind after spending a summer working as an ocean lifeguard in Kitty Hawk, N. C. He completed Aviation Survival Technician A School in December 2014 and is now, at 27, a fully qualified rescue swimmer. In the course of his training, he had been part of scores of rescue drills. But he had never drilled on a ship that had run aground. As soon as he splashed down in the churning surf, it was clear that putting the fishermen into the water would not work. “I swam in to shore, where the helicopter picked me up and then subsequently deployed me to the bow of the boat,” he said. “It was really rocking, bouncing back and forth. ” “The ship was listing 45 degrees to port,” he said. “The crew was all dressed in their survival suits when I landed on the bow of the boat. They were very cooperative. Several of them had small black garbage bags filled with personal effects that they asked if they could bring with them. They definitely seemed ready to leave. ” Even if the rescuers had managed to rig some wires from ship to shore, which the Fire Department was prepared to do, the scallopers would have had to leap 25 to 30 feet into the water and then contend with waves more than 12 feet high. “It had looked different from the air, but once I was on the ship it was clear that that plan would not work,” Petty Officer   said. The Coast Guard decided to lift each of the seven stranded men from the boat using a rescue basket  —   a delicate operation. “Water was already in the hull, and the ship was moving in a way separate from the way the ocean was moving,” recalled Petty Officer  . Lieutenant Bruno hovered the helicopter some 40 feet above the vessel as Petty Officer   loaded the scallopers, one by one, into the basket. And one by one, they were ferried to shore, where the Fire Department was waiting. As morning broke, the helicopter had been airborne for more than two hours, and there were still fishermen on the ship. Fuel was running dangerously low. Time was running out. The seventh man  —   the captain  —   wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, was the last to leave the ship. He asked about remaining with the vessel but agreed in the end that it was best to go. “His life being more valuable than a piece of equipment,” Petty Officer   noted. As the captain was loaded into the basket, Lieutenant Bruno looked at his fuel gauge. He had four minutes left. With the captain safely deposited on shore and the mission complete, Lieutenant Bruno flew to Floyd Bennett Field and set the helicopter down. All seven fishermen were safe and were transported to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for observation. None was seriously injured. The ship, too, was salvaged. It is now being repaired at a shipyard in Massachusetts. Even the scallops on board were saved. They were sold to a dealer based in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Petty Officer   reflecting on the rescue, said it was both the easiest and the hardest he had ever taken part in. “It was my first,” he said.",0
"Illinois House passes $5 billion tax package, spending plan CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois’ Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed big, permanent increases in income tax rates and a $36 billion fiscal 2018 spending plan on Sunday with the help of some Republican votes as the cash-strapped state scrambled to stave off a bond rating downgrade to junk.     The $5 billion tax package, which passed in a 72-45 vote and drew an immediate veto threat from Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, would boost the personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent and the corporate rate to 7 percent from 5.25 percent. It would also close tax loopholes and expand tax credits. The spending plan won passage in a 81-34 vote. Both bills now head to the Democratic-led Senate, which returns to session on Monday, for concurrence votes. The country’s fifth most populous state began an unprecedented third-straight fiscal year on Saturday without a complete budget. A fiscal stalemate between Illinois’ governor and Democrats who control the legislature has pounded the state’s credit ratings to a step above junk and ballooned its unpaid bill backlog to $15 billion. The pair of decisive House votes set Democrats on a collision course with Rauner, who vowed to veto the 32 percent personal income tax hike he pinned to House Speaker Michael Madigan.  “The legislature could have passed a no reform budget like this one two years ago,” Rauner said in a statement. “Instead, they allowed Mike Madigan to play his political games, passed phony budgets, racked up our debt and inflicted pain on the most vulnerable.” Rauner has insisted for two years that a budget be coupled with a property tax freeze and legislative term limits, among other things. In order for Rauner to match his tough words with results, he will have to persuade at least two of the 15 House Republicans to switch their yes votes in favor of the tax hike legislation. The measure passed the House with one more vote than the threshold necessary to override a gubernatorial veto. In his own statement after the votes, Madigan praised how Republicans and Democrats together took a “crucial step toward reaching a compromise that ends the budget crisis by passing a fully funded state budget in a bipartisan way.” The tax legislation would give the state a revenue boost to support a full-year budget and start paying down the bill pile that was on track to grow even larger after a federal judge on Friday ordered increased payments on Medicaid provider bills. In giving Democratic supporters the narrow margin to move the legislation to the state Senate, some House Republicans shed tears during debate, predicted their tax votes could topple them politically in next year’s elections and delivered a pointed challenge to Rauner to set aside his budgetary preconditions and do what was right for the state’s fiscal health. “I say to the governor, if these bills pass the House and Senate, the revenue bill and expenditure bill, we will have sent you a balanced budget. Have the courage to do what is right and sign the bills,” said State Representative David Harris, who was among 15 Republicans to side with Democrats. “Bring this madness to an end.” Their defiance came after House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, a Rauner ally, noted the deal was not negotiated with the governor and did not represent “an exercise in good faith,” given that negotiations involving some of the governor’s non-budgetary priorities were shunted to the sidelines.

"An Architect Who Built His Career on Resuscitating New York Landmarks - The New York Times Grand Central Terminal, the main building on Ellis Island and the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory at the New York Botanical Garden  —   all among the greatest New York City landmarks  —   look better today than they have since their earliest years. Many hands were responsible. John Belle was the common denominator. Mr. Belle, the retired founding partner of Beyer Blinder Belle, an architectural and planning firm that has specialized in preservation, restoration and contextual design, died last week at 84. With his death, the city has lost an architect who conveyed a genial joy in resuscitating the masterworks of his predecessors. That made him an appealingly modest figure in a room full of big architectural egos, since he was at his best when his own interventions were least obvious. New York has also lost a link to the intellectual crucible of the 1960s, when Jane Jacobs and others demanded that architects stop obliterating the past and, instead, take time to understand the many ways in which people were well served by older buildings and neighborhoods. “Preservation is one of the highest forms of good citizenship,” Mr. Belle said on his firm’s website. “As a witness to the aftermath of the urban renewal movement in New York, I was determined to find a different way. ” For her part, Ms. Jacobs held Beyer Blinder Belle in high regard. “They were looking at the fabric of the community,” she said in an interview in 1998. “That was very welcome and very exciting, that there were professionals who were, at last, doing that. ” She added: “A community can’t just come by waving a wand. It has history. History was, to the modernists, an enemy. So this was a very radical realization. And an important one. ” John Belle was born on June 30, 1932, in Cardiff, Wales. His father, Arthur, was a clerk at a Lyons tea shop in Cardiff. His mother, Gladys, was a housewife. Mr. Belle received diplomas from the Portsmouth School of Architecture in England and the Architectural Association in London before moving to the United States in 1959. Once in America, Mr. Belle worked for Josep Lluís Sert and Victor Gruen before starting his own firm in 1968 with Richard L. Blinder and John H. Beyer. Mr. Blinder died in 2006. Mr. Beyer is still active. Mr. Belle’s early work included community planning projects in Manhattan. With the addition of James Marston Fitch to the practice in 1979, Beyer Blinder Belle began moving to the forefront of   architecture. The firm attracted wide attention in 1990 with its renovation and restoration of the abandoned Ellis Island immigration station into the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration. The vaulted ceiling in the former Registry Room, made of 28, 258 Guastavino tiles, was cleaned until it looked  —   as Mr. Belle aptly put it  —   like   . Where modern interventions were needed, they were made as inconspicuous and respectful as possible. When the Haupt Conservatory at the botanical garden in the Bronx was restored in 1997, Herbert Muschamp, who was then the architecture critic at The New York Times, said it could “once again hold its sparkling glass head up high amid the great architectural symbols of New York. ” Though critics have faulted Beyer Blinder Belle’s conservatism, it is worth recalling that the firm was associated in 1998 with the daring architect Santiago Calatrava in what proved to be a losing bid to redesign the James A. Farley Building, also known as the General Post Office, as a Pennsylvania Station annex. Penn Station was not where Mr. Belle was to win his greatest renown. That was at Grand Central. You almost had to have been there in the 1970s and ’80s to believe how far the   terminal had fallen into decrepitude, even after its status as a landmark was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1978. Travelers shared Grand Central with a large homeless population. “The building was divided into turf claimed by different drug dealers,” Mr. Belle and Maxinne R. Leighton wrote in “Grand Central: Gateway to a Million Lives. ” “Commuters were scared to take trains there at night. Parents warned their children not to use the dangerous bathrooms. ” In 1990, a design and engineering consortium led by Beyer Blinder Belle began work. Their strategic first strike was to demolish a billboard called the Kodak Colorama, which had blocked daylight into the main concourse for 40 years. “It was as if life were being breathed back into the building,” Mr. Belle and Ms. Leighton wrote. “Many commuters stopped in their tracks, speechless and amazed at the change that had so instantly brought back the majesty of the space. ” Their astonishment increased as the concourse ceiling was cleaned by workers on a scaffold that was rolled slowly through the room over a   period. The mud brown sky turned a startling teal, with stars, constellations and zodiac signs popping out in   contrast. Besides restoring the past, Beyer Blinder Belle made fundamental changes, too, starting with the construction of an entirely new marble staircase to the east balcony. It echoed, but did not replicate, the ornate western staircase. Some preservationists hated the idea. But the firm prevailed before city and state preservation agencies after it uncovered a plan by the original architects, Warren  Wetmore, that showed a staircase to the east balcony. That proved, Mr. Belle and Ms. Leighton wrote, that the idea “was not an   ploy to have our personal imprint on the building, but that in fact our goal was to complete the original design. ” Mr. Muschamp, the architecture critic, approved. “The new eastern staircase, which threatened to diminish the room’s amplitude, has the opposite effect of magnifying it,” he wrote in 1998, as the $425 million renovation neared completion. He continued, “Even more impressive is the uncovering of the ramps, located just behind the ticket windows, that lead down to the lower level and its fabled Oyster Bar. ” “Beyer Blinder Belle’s greatest accomplishment,” Mr. Muschamp said, “has been to reveal that Grand Central is above all a monument to movement. ” Mr. Belle’s first wife, Wendy Adams Belle, an artist and teacher, died in 1974. His second wife, Anne Belle, a documentary filmmaker, died in 2003. He died on Thursday in Remsenburg, N. Y. where he had a home. He also lived in Manhattan. The cause was Lewy body disease, said his son David Belle, who survives him, along with another son, Sebastian three daughters, Amelia, Fenella and Antonia Chapman and eight grandchildren. Mr. Belle knew his work would never fully be done. “The act of restoring a building to its original state is only half the battle,” he and Ms. Leighton wrote. “The other half is to guard against its denigration throughout its future existence. ”",0
"Fear of Iranian general left Iraqi Kurdish oil fields deserted BAGHDAD/LONDON (Reuters) - When the Iraqi army and Iranian-backed Shi ite militia entered a key oil processing facility in Iraq s north to retake it from Kurdish Peshmerga forces last week, the installation was deserted and its alarm bells ringing. Engineers and workers on the facility, which processes oil from two major fields in the Kirkuk area of predominantly Sunni Kurdistan, had fled, fearing the military advance.  No one wanted to risk their life and decided to evacuate as stories about the Shi ite militia and Qassem Soleimani were spreading fast,  said a senior Kurdish oil industry source, referring to the head of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards. The source declined to be identified. Iraqi engineers arrived to the sound of alarm bells warning about system malfunctions, prompting them to immediately shut down wells. Now, they need passwords and expertise from their Kurdish counterparts to restore oil output fully.  The loss of control of Kirkuk oil fields is likely to starve the KRG of vital oil revenue and cause deep concern to global trading houses such as Vitol and Glencore, which have granted the semi-autonomous government billions of dollars in loans against future oil sales. Baghdad s lightning military offensive into northern Iraq came after the Kurdistan Regional Government held an independence referendum last month. Major-General Soleimani, one of the most influential military figures in the Middle East, with reach in Syria and Lebanon, issued tough warnings to Kurdish leaders ahead of the Iraqi military advance.  We went inside the oilfield facilities after Kurdish workers fled and we found overalls and safety boots thrown on the ground,  said an engineer from the Baghdad-run North Oil Company, who declined to be named because he was ordered not to speak publicly about the issue.   It seems that workers took them off and escaped very quickly.   NOC crews entered oil facilities in the Bai Hassan and Avana fields on Oct. 17 for the first time since 2014, when Peshmerga forces drove Islamic State from the area and found all crude oil stations unmanned. Peshmerga fighters had also withdrawn.  After we discovered that some of the key equipment was missing and the control panel was ringing alarms of crude processing malfunction, we immediately shut down oil wells,  the NOC engineer said. A week after the operation, Iraqi engineers are still struggling to resume Kirkuk s oil production, saying they had yet to understand how to operate the equipment processing some 350,000 barrels per day. The military offensive more than halved Kurdistan s oil output and cut its exports to global markets via Turkey by two thirds.  The drop in exports has deprived the region of more than $200 million in revenues over the past week, a Kurdish oil industry source familiar with loadings told Reuters. It has also dealt a further blow to the region s finances already stretched by a fight against Islamic State and a budget crisis caused by a fall in oil prices. The United States has called on both sides to resume dialogue, saying the tensions hamper efforts to fight Islamic State. Resuming normal oil production and exports will be challenging and will take at least another week and will only succeed if Iraqi and Kurdish engineers agree to cooperate, according to both sides. On Tuesday, NOC officials asked Kurdish engineering firm Kar Group to send back its workers, according to sources on both sides. Iraqi engineers need guidance on how to operate recently installed equipment at Bai Hassan and Avana, the sources said. The pumping and operational stations for both oil fields are located in the city of Dahuk, which unlike Kirkuk is still under the control of the Peshmerga forces.  Energy facilities in Kirkuk are more like a locked box and only their crew have the password,  the Iraqi engineer said. Kar Group has, however, so far refrained from going back without security guarantees, according to sources close to the engineering company. Kirkuk, one of the oldest and best known oil areas in the Middle East, had long been under the control of Iraqi forces until it was over-run by Islamic State. In 2014, it was retaken by the Peshmerga, the official security forces of the KRG, as part of their advance on Islamic State. That allowed Kurdistan to regain control of an area it believes is historically Kurdish and ramp up exports from the oil fields while borrowing billions of dollars from trading houses and Russian state oil major Rosneft.  We need to figure out who gets what when the fields resume production. At the moment the potential split of revenues is far from clear,  said the Kurdish oil industry source. Before the referendum, Kurdistan was exporting some 600,000 bpd of crude via Turkey, which it said had made it almost totally economically independent as it could pay its own bills without the need to wait for budget transfers from Baghdad. Under the deal with Baghdad, Kurdistan was exporting 540,000 bpd on behalf of the government in the city of Erbil and some 60,000 bpd on behalf of NOC. With the loss of control of the Kirkuk area, Kurdistan will be in theory left with only 250,000-300,000 bpd of its own output, less than it needs to cover its debt obligations. Vitol, Glencore, Petraco and Trafigura have loaned Kurdistan some $2.5 billion and Russia s Rosneft has loaned some $1.2 billion. Glencore s boss Ivan Glasenberg said last week he could not rule out a rescheduling of the payments. ",0
"In Once-Tolerant Mosul, a Social Unraveling That Feels Permanent - The New York Times ERBIL, Iraq  —   More than two years ago, a Christian farmer in his 70s named Mosa Zachariah fled his village near Mosul with, as he put it, only the pants he was wearing. He left behind his house, “tons of wheat” and a BMW. But now that his town, an early target of the Iraqi security forces as they advance on Mosul itself, has been cleared of the Islamic State forces, it is not jubilation he feels, but fear of what awaits him if he tries to return. He wistfully talked about his city’s diversity as something completely unattainable now. “In that time, the Muslims and Christians were like brothers,” he said. Musab Juma, a Shiite who used to live in the Mosul area, said he would not be going back, either. He relocated to Najaf, in southern Iraq, where he has a food stall and has decorated his home with old photos and antiques from his hometown. Yazidis and Kurds and Shabaks, other minorities that were once vital pieces of Mosul’s human tapestry, have moved on, too. And many Sunni Arabs, who make up most of Mosul’s population, say they will never go home again, even if that is where their parents and grandparents are buried. Before the Islamic State’s occupation began more than two years ago, Mosul was Iraq’s most diverse city. Its rich culture, stretching back to the ancient Assyrians, and reputation for tolerance made it a vital symbol of an Iraq that could at least aspire to being a unified and whole nation. Now, as Mosul’s exiled civilians watch the battle for their city unfold, the only thing they seem to have in common is the belief that they once shared a special history that can never be reclaimed. Some of that belief, but not all, was torn apart after the   invasion of Iraq in 2003, when many Christians felt threatened and fled as Arabs and Kurds fought over old animosities. Mosul, home for many former Baathist army officers suddenly tossed from power after the invasion, became a center of the Sunni insurgency and a stronghold of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor of the Islamic State. “Until 2003, the Mosul community was living in peaceful coexistence, but after that, things changed,” said Jafar Khaleel, 46, who left Mosul in 2014 after the Islamic State onslaught. “The Sunnis don’t trust the Shiites. The Shabak cannot live with the Christian. This is what the American occupation left behind. ” Back then, there was a social compact for Iraq’s minorities that at least promised security in exchange for tolerating the tyranny and lack of personal freedoms under Saddam Hussein’s government, led by an elite class of Iraq’s minority Sunni population. Today, there is widespread nostalgia for that time, though it is not shared by most of Iraq’s Shiite majority, now in power. “For generations, life was normal there,” said Sabah Salim Dawood, 62, a Christian from Mosul. “In the factories, on the farms, in the offices, nobody asked, ‘What are you?’ ” Now there is a sense of unraveling that feels permanent. “A man cannot describe in words what he misses,” said Omar Ahmed, 29, who used to work in Mosul’s Health Ministry and is now exiled in the northern Kurdish region. Walking through a ransacked church recently in Bartella, a mostly Christian town at the edge of Mosul, reveals an elegy to what has been lost. Some walls have been burned others are streaked with Islamic State graffiti. A whiteboard on a wall in an anteroom lists a daily schedule for Islamic State recruits  —   fitness routines, weapons instructions and Shariah law lessons. Strewn on the floor are dusty reminders of those who once prayed there: Christian storybooks, copies of a “quarterly social  cultural journal” published by the Chaldean Church, a Santa Claus figurine, photographs of schoolgirls and a pink plastic rose. An old Iraqi tourist guide from the 1980s celebrated Mosul as a city whose rich history as a place of great Arab conquests important to the region’s   past that made it “a city of great importance. ” Its nickname as the “the city of two springs”  —   because autumn and spring weather are so similar  —   was a testament to the city’s livability. “Since 1969, a Spring Festival has been held every year in Mosul,” the tourist guide noted. “Flower processions and folk dancing by thousands of people from every walk of life bring much gaiety to the place. ” Moslawis, as they are known, have their own dialect, and jokes, many based on their reputation for being stingy, which goes back to a famine in 1917, when they suffered as the Ottoman Empire took food from the city to feed its starving army. The rest of Iraq is known for its generosity, but a common joke goes that the only time a Moslawi will invite someone in for lunch is during Ramadan, when everyone is fasting. Even so, the city is also known for its food, especially Mosul’s kibbe, flat bulgur wheat discs stuffed with ground meat that are famous all over Iraq. There is the abundance of cultural heritage, the remnants of empires: ancient churches, monasteries, tombs, shrines and an antiquities museum that is important not just to Mosul but the broader Middle East. Nearly all have been destroyed or defaced by the Islamic State. Putting the city back together socially is “going to take a very, very long time,” said Rasha   a Sunni Arab from Mosul who now lives in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where she is a research fellow at the   Studies and Research Center and writes about her home city. “I think everyone is going to live on their own. The Yazidis are going to live on their own. Christians are going to live on their own. The Sunnis are going to live on their own. ” As a child, she recalls, her classroom had seven Christians, seven or eight Kurds, two or three Yazidis, one or two Shiites, and the rest Sunni Arabs. There were four or five languages spoken, she said, plus three religions and two sects of Islam. “That diversity you didn’t find anywhere else,” she said. Walking to school, she would pass by a winged bull statue from Assyrian times, at the old city walls, that has been demolished by the Islamic State. “I really regret now that I took them for granted,” she said. Perhaps most painful is seeing former friends turn into enemies. Muhammad Sayed, 26, is Shiite, so for him there was only this choice when the Islamic State took over Mosul: Leave or be killed. Like many Shiites from the city, he eventually moved to Najaf, a holy city for his sect, where he now bakes bread and sells it on the street. “The Islamic State destroyed my childhood and my memories,” he said. “They turned some of my friends into murdering terrorists, some of the friends that I studied with in primary school and high school, and I have the most beautiful memories with them. But they have joined the terrorists, and for them, I have become an infidel. ” The task of trying to stitch Iraq back together is immensely complicated. But for Iraqis who have been displaced, it all boils down to a single, simple human emotion. “The major problem in Iraq is dealing with fear,” said Falah Mustafa, the Kurdish region’s foreign minister, at a recent panel discussion in Erbil, about Mosul’s future. “It’s immensely painful to be betrayed by your neighbor. ”",0
"U.S. patent review board becomes conservative target NEW YORK(Reuters) - In August, a dozen inventors gathered around a fire pit outside the headquarters of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Alexandria, Virginia, and set alight patents they said had been rendered worthless by an overreaching federal government.  “It’s time for us to make patents great again,” Michael Caputo, an advisor to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, told those gathered. US Inventor, the group behind the protest Caputo now represents as a spokesman, is calling for the abolition of the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative tribunal run by the patent office that reviews the validity of patents.  The rallying cry marks an about-face for some conservatives, who broadly supported the board’s creation in 2011 as a way to rein in trial lawyers and “patent trolls,” who hold patents for the sole purpose of suing big companies for licensing fees.  “Things have really flipped when it comes to the conservative perspective on patents,” said Charles Duan, a lawyer with left-leaning consumer group Public Knowledge. Much of the credit goes to activists who have convinced many conservatives that the real problem is not out-of-control litigation but how the tribunal designed to speed up resolving patent disputes favors big business over smaller rivals.  The change of positions has been aided by deepening right-wing distrust of tech giants, such as Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, which have benefited the most from PTAB while embracing liberal causes like immigration or gay and transgender rights. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2A1LfXV) The U.S. Supreme Court is due to rule sometime next year on whether the tribunal is an unconstitutional intrusion of the executive branch onto matters reserved for the courts and influential conservative groups are already weighing in. The Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, Federalist Society, and the American Conservative Union have published articles or submitted briefs arguing that PTAB should be abolished. Most legal experts expect it to survive, though, noting the Supreme Court has largely accepted the powers of executive-branch courts in other areas, such as public employee benefits. The mounting criticism of PTAB could still convince the court’s conservative justices to vote for abolition, said Q. Todd Dickinson, a lawyer with the firm Polsinelli and a former director of the patent office.  The advocacy effort by conservative groups could also convince the Trump administration to curb the patent board’s power, Dickinson said. AN ANTI-TROLL WEAPON More than 70 percent of the Republicans in Congress backed  the legislation that created PTAB. At the time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the law would “help reduce unnecessary litigation against American businesses.” In February the same business lobbying group criticized PTAB for creating “cost and uncertainty for patent owners.” U.S. Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who holds patents relating to computer interfaces, was not in Congress at the time the board was created, but said conservatives’ initial intent to curb excessive litigation has gradually given way to fears that PTAB is helping the wrong businesses.   The board’s creation was pushed by big tech companies, banks and retailers, who complained they were being inundated with “troll” lawsuits.  Successfully defending a patent case in federal court often takes years and costs millions of dollars, escalating pressure to settle. PTAB offered a cheaper and faster alternative. The average cost of litigating a PTAB petition to a final decision is about $250,000, according to patent risk management company RPX Corp.  There are no juries and limited live witness testimony in PTAB proceedings, and its administrative judges apply a lower standard of proof than would be required in federal court.  About 80 percent of the patents that PTAB makes final decisions on are either partially or fully invalidated, according to a report issued in October by the patent office. But the agency also said 56 percent of patents challenged at PTAB are upheld, in part because the court frequently declines requests to review patents.  A spokesman for the patent office declined to comment.  Inventors say PTAB has made it much harder to get patents licensed by big technology, which now routinely respond to patent infringement claims by initiating PTAB proceedings.  “Patents owners who don’t have the wherewithal to withstand serial challenges to the validity of their patents just can’t license them,” said David Pridham, chief executive of Dominion Harbor, a firm that owns and attempts to license former Eastman Kodak Co patents.  Paul Morinville, a cowboy hat-wearing entrepreneur from Indiana and the founder of US Inventor, said it has become harder for him to get funding for his business based on software patents he holds.  Morinville has been speaking to Republican lawmakers and their staffers for the past four years and many conservatives credit his group with raising alarm about the patent tribunal.  “They are as close to your iconic garage inventor as you can get, so their stories really resonate,” said James Edwards, a conservative lobbyist focused on patent law. While conservative groups have been most vocal, the debate transcends party lines. Some Republicans, such as Representative Darrell Issa of California, keep supporting the PTAB, while some Democrats have joined Republicans in calls to curb its powers.  Many trial lawyers whose case loads have fallen also oppose it. But many liberals have embraced PTAB as a means of eliminating brand-name pharmaceutical patents that keep drug prices high. Generic drug makers and large tech companies are also among the board’s supporters, arguing it has actually increased competition by weeding out low-quality patents. The conservative backlash in part reflects how the right views tech giants like Apple and Google, which thanks to the tribunal have prevailed in hundreds of disputes with patent owners seeking hefty compensation.  “Google, Amazon, and Apple and other big tech companies - you look at their power and it is really astounding. And they are generally left-leaning companies,” said Matthew Dowd, a conservative patent lawyer in Washington D.C. who has represented US Inventor. “Those dynamics are definitely playing into the increasing willingness of conservatives to speak up about patents.” ",0
"Trump interviews four for Fed chair job, to decide in two-three weeks WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is ramping up his search for a new chief for the U.S. central bank, meeting with former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and three others and promising a decision next month. “I’ve had four meetings for Fed chairman and I’ll be making a decision over the next two or three weeks,” Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Trump has previously suggested he may reappoint Fed Chair Janet Yellen to the post. Jerome Powell, one of the current governors on the Fed’s board, also met with Trump earlier this week about the Fed job, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Trump on Friday did not provide details on his meetings.  A new Fed chair would take the helm as the central bank eases well away from crisis-era policies in response to a strengthening economy and falling unemployment, though inflation still lingers below the Fed’s 2-percent goal. Under Yellen, the Fed has raised interest rates and launched a plan to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Much of the latter was accumulated through a controversial bond-buying program that Yellen said helped the economy avert an even deeper downturn. Her term as chair expires in February.  Warsh was a Fed governor between 2006 and 2011 and resigned from the board because of his opposition to the bond-buying program. He has called for a revamp of how the Fed makes monetary policy, saying it needs “fresh air” from markets and from the “real economy.”  Treasury yields spurted higher on news of the Trump meetings; Warsh is viewed as more of a hawk than Yellen. “He’s definitely more hawkish on the spectrum. He is quite a contrast to Yellen. It does seem he is the front-runner even though it’s not a sure thing he will be nominated,” Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, said of Warsh. As recently as July, Trump had not ruled out reappointing Yellen, telling the Wall Street Journal that he liked her demeanor and desire to keep interest rates low. In addition to Warsh and Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor’s name also has been floated as a contender. Powell specialized in financial regulatory matters during his five years on the Fed Board of Governors, which is led by the Fed chair. There has also been speculation that Trump could turn to his top economic aide, Gary Cohn, for the Fed chair position. A Fed spokesman declined to comment on the process while Warsh and Taylor did not respond to requests for comment.  ",0
"Delingpole: Top Physicist and Leading Republicans Urge Trump to Quit Paris Climate Agreement Should Donald Trump hamstring the U. S. economy, rip off the consumer, despoil the landscape, give succour to America’s enemies and promote junk science  —   all in order to keep a “seat at the table” with people who despise him and think he’s an idiot? [To some people  —   including several senior members of the Trump administration  —   the answer isn’t immediately obvious. Which is why this week both a leading U. S. scientist and a number of top Senate Republicans have had to urge the president to see sense and ignore the siren voices urging him to stay in the UN’s Paris climate agreement.  The 20 top Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,  . have signed a letter warning the president that remaining in Paris “would subject the United States to significant litigation risk that could   your administration’s ability to fulfill its goal of rescinding the Clean Power Plan. ” Meanwhile, the distinguished physicist Will Happer  —   long mooted as a possible Science Advisor in the Trump administration  —   has argued that staying in Paris will not only be pointless but will be a betrayal of Trump’s election promise to voters that he would pull out. Climate policy, however, poses a grave threat. Yes, those who engineered the Paris Agreement will be upset if the United States withdraws. Withdrawal will also outrage the many who profit from climate alarmism. But remaining in the Paris Agreement will not sit well with many of those who voted for Mr. Trump in part because of his campaign promises to withdraw from the agreement. These voters rightly perceived that the agreement would benefit a privileged international elite, at the expense of the common people of the United States and of the rest of the world. You might think that such interventions ought to be unnecessary. President Trump is, after all, an avowed climate skeptic who has already taken several important steps towards tackling the Green Blob, most recently by promising to eliminate “nearly $1. 6 billion in international programs aimed at promoting green energy and fighting global warming. ” Among the targets on his hit list: the United Nations’ Green Climate Fund (GCF) which hands out money for programs to adapt or mitigate global warming the Clean Technology Fund and the Strategic Climate Fund  —   saving $239 million and the Global Climate Change Initiative, saving U. S. taxpayers $362 million. But Trump is still wavering over the Paris climate agreement, which senior members of his administration, including Jared Kushner, daughter Ivanka, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are urging him not to quit. Anyone puzzled by the fact that the former CEO of Exxon is supporting an agreement totally opposed to the company’s business model and shareholder interests really needs to read this   piece by Steve Milloy. Exxon, Milloy explains, like most Big Oil companies has effectively been hijacked by green activists. As described in George Washington University professor Jarol B. Manheim’s 2004 book “  and the    Elite: The Progressive Attack on the Corporation,”   political activists met and decided after the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 that one way back to political power was to become activist shareholders in publicly owned corporations. That is, they would exercise the rights and status of shareholders to pressure, if not, capture corporate managements so as to use corporate resources and influence to help achieve their political agenda. It has been an enormously successful strategy for the activists, especially when it comes to the controversy over climate change. Not only do many of the largest and     corporations now openly advocate for climate policies, even oil and gas companies have been pressured into pursuing policies that militate against their own products. This is one of the many disastrous side effects of the growing power of the green blob: it is stopping businesses from doing business, making everyone poorer as a result. As Milton Friedman famously wrote in 1970: “There is one and only one social responsibility of business  —   to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud. ” So businesses serve as society’s wealth generators. They are not governments, charities, or activist groups. When it comes to climate, Exxon Mobil’s job is to create wealth via production and sale of oil and gas  —   not to participate in the dubious pursuit of returning the atmosphere to   Revolution conditions. Amen, bro. Mr President  —   jobs, the economy and the American way are in peril here. Are you listening?",0

"Georgetown Professors Instruct Students on How to ’Resist’ Trump Presidency - Breitbart An   event at Georgetown University that took place on Saturday featured professors and activists discussing how the left can best “resist” Donald Trump during his presidency. [The event, which was entitled, “Resisting, Organizing, and Building in the Age of Trump,” featured professors and activists who are concerned about America’s future under   Donald Trump.  The description from the event’s Facebook page claims that the event was a discussion on how the left can ensure the freedom and dignity of all individuals during a Trump presidency. The stakes of this political moment couldn’t be higher. We need to collectively think through how we can best respond, resist, organize, and build a future that guarantees the freedom and dignity of all during the next four years of Trump’s presidency and beyond. On January 14th, Georgetown doctoral and law students will hold a   at Georgetown University bringing together DC   and academics from across disciplines to discuss the nature of the relationship of Trumpism to racism, bigotry, and oppression in all its multifaceted forms and the urgent question of how the left should move forward. “The Georgetown administration is not your friend,” argued campus employee Josh Armstead of UNITE Here Local 23, which represents hotel, gaming, food service, and airport industry workers. Armstead claimed that Georgetown’s administration benefits from “prison labor. ”  The discussion segments frequently mentioned topics of privilege, systematic oppression, and stereotyping. George Washington University Philosophy Professor Vanessa Wills defined oppression as an “exclusion from full personhood or society based on identity. ” Jessica Lee, a program director at the Center for Social Justice at Georgetown, suggested that   students need to check their privilege. She said that students need to understand their privilege so that they know when it is appropriate for them to speak up. Others complained about the electoral college system, suggesting that Donald Trump will be an illegitimate president. Georgetown History Professor Joseph McCartin claimed that America is “facing a crisis of democracy. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about social justice and libertarian issues for Breitbart News.

"U.S. House approves bill on financial regulation costs WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill requiring the country’s top securities regulator to add up the costs of following new rules before putting them into force, part of a Republican push to reform the federal bureaucracy. By a vote of 243-183, the chamber passed the bill, largely along party lines, which would also require the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to periodically review its existing rules.  “Whether it is buying a car or choosing a college savings plan, every American family weighs the pros and cons before making major life decisions,” said Representative Ann Wagner, the Missouri Republican who sponsored the bill. The legislation “simply requires that the Commission engages in the same process and can justify that the benefits of a proposed regulation will outweigh its costs,” she said. At the same time, the House passed a bill requiring the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the country’s derivatives regulator, to assess the costs and benefits of proposed regulations or orders. The CFTC legislation also treads into two long-standing disputes. It bars the SEC from lowering the dollar-amount threshold for requiring swap dealers to register with it. Currently the bar is at $8 billion, and there have been moves to drop it to $3 billion. It also restricts the commission in limiting positions that traders can hold in the commodity markets. The CFTC has pushed off finalizing those limits, included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to prevent fraud and manipulation, over Republicans’ concerns they will hurt farmers and small businesses. Republican lawmakers who control Congress are eager to ease regulation and undo rules enacted under President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Nonetheless, Democrats hold enough seats in the U.S. Senate to block the SEC and CFTC legislation. Only nine Democrats in the House voted for the SEC bill, and seven for the CFTC bill. A single Republican, North Carolina’s Walter Jones, voted against both bills. ",0
"Trump extols corporate profits while seeking corporate tax cut WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump sent a Twitter message bragging about corporate America’s high profits under his presidency on Tuesday, prompting critics to say he was undercutting Republican arguments in favor of a tax cut for corporations. As Republicans in Washington try to refocus on taxes after the collapse of their failed drive to repeal Obamacare, Trump sent a morning tweet that said: “Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now.” Corporate lobbyists and Republicans consistently argue that a cut in the corporate income tax is needed to help corporations be more competitive. But highlighting corporate profits could diminish that argument. “This is a weird way to launch their proposal to cut corporate taxes,” Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said in a tweet of his own responding to Trump. The largest U.S. public companies have seen profits accelerate in 2017, with quarterly earnings rising at a double-digit pace compared with a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Full-year earnings are expected to be up 11.5 percent, which would be the strongest growth since 2011. More than six months into his presidency, Trump still sends out tweets that catch aides and allies off guard and sometimes clash with Republicans’ messaging on their policy agenda. The Trump tweet “takes the edge of urgency off the plea to reduce the burden on corporations,” said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank. Trump later took credit for surging U.S. stock prices that pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new record high on Tuesday. But the broader market saw a bigger rally under former President Barack Obama. The benchmark S&P 500 Index has gained 9.4 percent since Trump took office on Jan. 20, lagging a 16.2 percent S&P gain during Obama’s first months in office. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Congress would take up tax reform after the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Sept. 4, beginning in the House of Representatives. A White House timeline envisions a House vote on tax legislation in October and Senate vote in November.  But there is little consensus on the issue. The White House insists on cutting the corporate rate to 15 percent, while House Republicans favor 20 percent. A top Senate Republican this week said lawmakers would be lucky to get it down to 25 percent.   On Tuesday, Senate Democrats offered to work with Republicans on a bipartisan tax package, but only if it does not cut taxes for the wealthy, add to the federal deficit or allow Republicans to enact legislation on their own. But McConnell rejected the offer from 45 lawmakers led by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “Most of the principles that would get the country growing again, they’re not interested in addressing,” the Kentucky Republican told reporters.  McConnell said he hoped Republican legislation might win support from three Senate Democrats who face reelection next year in Republican states and did not join the offer from other Democrats. ",0
"Philippine ferry capsizes with 251 on board, four dead MANILA (Reuters) - Four people were killed and seven were missing after a Philippine ferry with 251 people on board capsized during bad weather on Thursday near the capital, Manila, disaster officials and a coastguard spokesman said. Accidents involving boats sailing between the many islands of the Philippines are common. Vessels are often overloaded but the coastguard said that was not the case on Thursday and the ferry had the capacity to carry 286 people. A total of 240 people were rescued from the sea by fishermen and rescue boats sent out by the coastguard hours after the ferry capsized and sank, about eight miles off Real town in Quezon province.  Search and rescue operations will continue until all crew and passengers are accounted for,  said coastguard spokesman Captain Armand Balilo. Most of the rescued passengers were brought to Dinahican port. Two men and two women drowned, he said. The ferry set sail at around dawn from a port in Real. Survivors told reporters the weather turned bad three hours later with strong winds and huge waves. The ferry began taking in water and in minutes it capsized and sank, they said. Disaster officials said search and rescue operations were hampered by heavy rain and huge waves caused by a tropical storm affecting the southern Philippines. A tropical storm is expected to make landfall on the southern island of Mindanao late Thursday or early on Friday. The weather bureau has warned of extensive flooding and landslides as the storm, packing center winds of 65 kph (40 mph), approaches the Philippines.  ",0
"Donald Trump, Indonesia, Aleppo: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald J. Trump picked a retired Marine general, an advocate of China and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry for three crucial posts. Gen. John F. Kelly, above, a retired Marine general, will be nominated as secretary of homeland security, and Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa was named ambassador to China. Mr. Branstad is close to President Xi Jinping of China, whom he has known since 1985. Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, was chosen to run the Environmental Protection Agency. _____ 2. Mr. Trump, who was named Time magazine’s person of the year, said in a   interview on NBC’s “Today” show that Mitt Romney remained a candidate for secretary of state. Mr. Trump did not dispute the interviewer’s comparison of his campaign promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants he considers dangerous to comments made by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, about annihilating drug dealers and users. A Times photojournalist documented 57 homicides over 35 days in Mr. Duterte’s bloody crackdown. (Warning: graphic images.) _____ 3. An earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sumatra killed scores of people while they slept. Rescue teams are searching for victims and survivors, but the death toll is nearing 100, and more are feared dead. The quake, which struck after 5 a. m. had a preliminary magnitude of 6. 5, and at least five aftershocks followed. _____ 4. We talked to Edgar Welch, the    who is in jail after firing a gun inside a Washington pizzeria. Mr. Welch said he first learned about the fake news story suggesting Hillary Clinton was linked to a child trafficking ring being run out of the restaurant through word of mouth, then looked it up online. “The intel on this wasn’t 100 percent,” he said. He has two kids and said that he didn’t vote for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. _____ 5. “We are trapped under bombs. ” The Twitter account shared by a    girl in Aleppo, Bana   and her mother has captured global attention with posts about bombs, death and despair. It has also raised questions about authenticity. Syrian government forces appear to be pushing deeper into the city. _____ 6. For the first time in decades, powerful rival law firms have joined forces to file suits nationwide on a polarizing social issue: gun control. “There is an epidemic of gun violence in this country, and the law can save innocent lives without infringing constitutional rights,” a partner at one of the firms said. _____ 7. This is the 75th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States naval base in Hawaii, where more than 2, 000 Americans were killed. We spoke with John Morris, above, a photojournalist whose 25th birthday was underway when editors called to tell him of the attack. Now celebrating his 100th birthday, he reflected on a career largely defined by war, saying, “Mankind is not as bright as one would hope. ” _____ 8. A cancer patient who was twice rejected from a study may hold the key to new treatment options for thousands of people. Celine Ryan, above, had advanced colon cancer that spread to her lungs when she was accepted for an experimental treatment that used cells from her own immune system. Today, she has no signs of cancer. _____ 9. The gadget age is over, our tech columnist declares. The little electronic things that did stuff for you  —   from transistor radios to the Walkman, iPods and GoPros and Fitbits  —   have been replaced by the “Thing That Does Everything” (better known as a smartphone). _____ 10. Phil Jackson, president of the New York Knicks, has a nickname: Zen Master. The team has been taking part in mindfulness exercises since Mr. Jackson took over in 2014. This year, he began leading the sessions himself. Players told us that they found the exercises useful, even if they were not quite sure what they were doing. _____ 11. Finally, we’ve gathered our film critics and asked them to share their picks for the best movies of the year. Their selections veer away from box office hits. Only two movies made the lists of all three critics: “Moonlight,” above, and “O. J.: Made In America. ” _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

"Death toll from blasts in Somalia's capital Mogadishu tops 200 MOGADISHU (Reuters) - More than 200 people were killed by twin bomb blasts that struck busy junctions in the heart of Somalia s capital Mogadishu, officials said on Sunday, marking the deadliest attacks since an Islamist insurgency began in 2007. President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo declared three days of national mourning and called for donations of blood and funds to victims of Saturday s attack. At least 100 others were wounded.  Today s horrific attack proves our enemy would stop nothing to cause our people pain and suffering. Let s unite against terror,  he tweeted.  Police said a truck bomb exploded outside a hotel in the K5 intersection that is lined with government offices, restaurants and kiosks, flattening several buildings and setting dozens of vehicles on fire. Two hours later, another blast struck the capital s Medina district.  We have confirmed 200 civilians died in yesterday s blast. We understand the death toll is higher than that. Many people are still missing their relatives,  Abdifatah Omar Halane, the spokesman for Mogadishu s mayor, told Reuters.  A spokesman for Aamin Ambulance service said it knew of more than 250 people wounded during the bombings on Saturday.  Some people who searched for their relatives just found unrecognizable body parts,  its director Abdikadir Abdirahman told Reuters.   In our 10 year experience as the first responder in #Mogadishu, we haven t seen anything like this,  tweeted the ambulance service, which is reliant on private donations and the only free ambulance service in the city.  We re mourning the loss of 5 Somali Red Crescent volunteers, also killed in this attack,  tweeted the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Police and emergency workers searched the rubble of destroyed buildings on Sunday. They had recovered dozens of corpses the night before, most of which were charred beyond recognition. Hundreds of people came to the junction in search of missing family members and police cordoned off the area for security reasons. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which is allied to al Qaeda, stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country. The group is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 and have been steadily losing territory since then to the combined forces of African Union peacekeepers and Somali security forces. But al Shabaab retains the ability to mount large, complex bomb attacks. Over the past three years, the number of civilians killed by insurgent bombings has steadily climbed as al Shabaab increases the size of its bombs.  ",0
"Donald Trump Returns to Bashing ’Fake Media’ President Donald Trump returned to his attacks on the biased media, after a weekend away from Washington D.

"Three Arrested for Starting Massive Fire on Atlanta Interstate Bridge Three people were arrested Friday in connection with a massive fire under a bridge on Interstate 85 in Atlanta that caused part of the bridge to collapse. [Deputy Insurance Commissioner Jay Florence said Basil Eleby, Sophia Bruner, and Barry Thomas were the three suspects arrested, the Daily Mail reported.  Eleby, whom Florence believes started the fire, faces a charge of criminal damage to property.

"Women knit pink 'pussyhats' for rally after Trump inauguration LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Editors Note: Attention to language that may be offensive to some readers in paragraph 3 The National Mall in Washington could become a sea of bright pink the day after Donald Trump is inaugurated as U.S. president if the vision of a pair of Los Angeles women is realized.   For two months, Krista Suh and Jayna Zweiman have called on people around the world to make 1.17 million pink “pussyhats” for those attending the Women’s March, a rally on Jan. 21 organized with hopes of bringing attention to civil and human rights issues. The name of the hats comes partly from President-elect Trump’s comments in an infamous 2005 tape that came to light during his campaign in which, discussing women, he said: “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” The project is meant to “create a sea of pink hats which is going to be a strong collective visual statement,” Zweiman said.  It is also meant to involve “people across the country and the world who want to be a part of the march but can’t physically be there and want to support the marchers,” she said.  The women have asked volunteers around the world to help sew, crochet or knit pink hats with ears by using simple patterns available on the project’s website. They say it is easier than knitting a scarf, the typical starter project for novices. “It’s a rectangle folded in half, stitched up the sides and when you put it on your round head, these ears come out,” said Zweiman, surrounded by women stitching away at a knitting store on Friday night. Marchers can get a hat by contacting a maker through an online distribution system, through social media or at sites in Washington. “So it’s a distribution system that’s very grassroots and our aim is to get a hat on every marcher’s head who wants one,” Zweiman said. Organizers have said the protest could draw around 200,000 people, but Suh and Zweiman decided to aim for the 1.17 million people that could feasibly fit in the Mall. For some knitters at Friday’s “pussyhat party,” it was hard to put the needles down as the deadline nears. “Doing this is taking my mind off things,” said Marina Mont’Ros.  “This will be my 35th hat. Every time I think ‘OK, that’s enough. I’ve made enough, I’m going to stop,’ I read something in the news and, give me that yarn! I’m making more.” ",0

"Snapchat Discover Takes a Hard Line on Misleading and Explicit Images - The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO  —   On Snapchat last week, MTV published an article with the headline “Is this the thirstiest person on earth?” The article, which ran on Snapchat’s news service, Discover, appeared with a picture of a   blond woman taking a selfie, even though the piece was about a fully clothed man. Those kinds of risqué and misleading images will now be much less prominent on Discover because early on Monday, Snapchat updated its guidelines for publishers in a way that essentially cleans up what is shown on its news service. The new rules more explicitly restrict publishers from posting questionable pictures on Discover that do not have news or editorial value. Snapchat also clarified guidelines that prevent publishers from including reports or links to outside websites that could be considered fake news, saying that all content must be   and accurate. The changes aim to “empower our editorial partners to do their part to keep Snapchat an informative, factual and safe environment for everyone,” said Rachel Racusen, a spokeswoman for the company. Snapchat said it also planned to give publishers a tool in February that would allow them to   content, or stop minors from seeing some content altogether. The moves  —   which come ahead of an initial public offering expected for this spring by Snapchat’s parent company, Snap  —   underscore how the company is trying to distinguish itself from rival social media services. Facebook and Twitter typically give users, including publications, wide latitude in what they can post, which has led the companies into one controversy after another  —   including criticism over fake news and outrage over harassment and abuse by internet trolls. Snapchat is   acting to limit those problems in a way that is reminiscent of how traditional media companies curate what they show people. “Snapchat thinks about the role that its content plays in the lives of consumers differently,” said Steven Kydd, one of the founders of Tastemade, an online food publication. “This is cable all over again, except for a mobile and global audience. ” Cleaning up what is published on Discover could have many benefits for Snapchat, like helping the service appeal to advertisers, which would not have to worry as much that they would be advertising alongside inappropriate content for Snapchat’s primary audience of teenagers and  . The new rules could also whet investors’ appetites for Snapchat if they help the company avoid the taints of fake news and online abuse that have dogged its rivals. “In this environment, every technology company that touches media is concerned about being vulnerable to connections to fake news and disinformation,” said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “That’s doubly true for a company planning for an I. P. O. ” Snapchat introduced Discover in January 2015 as a part of its mobile app, where it publishes content from established media brands like CNN and Cosmopolitan, as well as newer outlets like the political channel We the People. For Snapchat, Discover is a way to engage users more deeply. Publishers see Discover as an avenue to reach a new and younger audience. From the start, Snapchat approached news differently from other social networks. While Facebook has said it is not a media company and does not want to be an arbiter of truth in news on its website, Snapchat has long prohibited false or deceptive content and is thoroughly involved in editorial standards for content on Discover. In a blog post published when Discover began, Snapchat said: “Social media companies tell us what to read based on what’s most recent or most popular. We see it differently. We count on editors and artists, not clicks and shares, to determine what’s important. ” As a result, Snapchat has always exercised a large degree of control over Discover. To secure a place on Discover, publishers have had to agree to fairly stringent guidelines around editing and video production, including having audio play at a consistent volume and a ban on images that are misleading or gimmicky. Snapchat also mandated that all images and headlines be appropriate for an audience as young as 13 years old. Discover has grown quickly. More than 100 million Snapchat users view content on Discover each month, according to the company. While some publishers said people were initially slow to embrace Discover, interest has increased over the past year. Tastemade, which publishes different editions for different areas around the world on Discover, said it had been pleased enough with the size of its Snapchat audience that it planned to grow with Snapchat as it rolled out worldwide. Still, Snapchat has not been able to entirely sidestep criticism about what it shows on Discover. In July, a   lawsuit filed against the company alleged that Discover intentionally exposed minors “to harmful, offensive, prurient and sexually offensive content without warning minors or their parents that they would be exposed to such explicit content. ” The lawsuit cited examples of inappropriate content on Discover, like a post from BuzzFeed that sexualized images from Disney movies and a post from Cosmopolitan, with photos, about a performance artist who let strangers touch her genitalia. While the lawsuit was dismissed in November because the sides agreed to settle, Snapchat said it had decided to take action in response to the litigation. It soon created a new tool, which Snapchat said it had been discussing for a while, that let publishers prevent Snapchat users who were under age 18 from seeing certain content. When people sign up for Snapchat, they must enter their age and a phone number that is confirmed by the service. Snapchat also reserves the right to gate content for youngsters, even if a publisher has chosen not to do so. In updating its publisher guidelines, Snapchat aimed to clarify vague language and provide more examples around its restrictions on the use of nudity, profanity and violent images. The new rules more clearly state that publishers should not use overly sexualized or violent images as the initial visual that users are exposed to when they look at Discover and that content intended simply to shock or disgust is not allowed. Some exceptions are made for   material that has news value. For the first time, the guidelines have a dedicated section detailing the warnings that publishers must run when graphic images are deemed newsworthy, as well as when to   that content. Some of these updates came out of conversations that began months ago with several publishers that routinely published racier content, including The Daily Mail and Cosmopolitan, as well as news services that published controversial images. “We have been collaborating closely with all of our publishers, whose content has continued to evolve,” said Nick Bell, Snapchat’s vice president for content. “We want to be a great partner to all of our editorial partners, and updating our content guidelines to better reflect where our platform is today is an important part of that. ” One of the publishers that talked with Snapchat about the new rules was Sweet, a   channel created by the media company Hearst, which said its viewership on Discover had grown substantially over the past few months. Ross Clark, Sweet’s general manager and vice president, likened the updated guidelines to a parental advisory sticker on an album or to ratings on movies. “The media industry has always included clearly established content guidelines,” Mr. Clark said. “It’s what allows a platform to have a large, diverse set of users. ”",0
"U.S. allies show support for strikes on Syria (Reuters) - U.S. allies expressed support on Friday for Washington’s missile strikes on Syria, calling them a proportionate response to Syrian forces’ suspected use of chemical weapons.  The strikes were denounced as illegal by Syria and its allies Russia and Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called on the world ""to reject such policies, which bring only destruction and danger to the region and the globe"". (Graphic locator map on attack - tmsnrt.rs/2nm68H0)  Iraq criticized “hasty interventions” in an apparent comment on the U.S. action. But a wide range of U.S. allies from Asia, Europe and the Middle East expressed support, if sometimes cautiously, in similar terms. “The U.K. government fully supports the U.S. action, which we believe was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime and is intended to deter further attacks,” a British government spokesman said. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters: “Many innocent people became victims from the chemical attacks. “Japan supports the U.S. government’s determination to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons,” he said. Turkey viewed the strikes positively and the international community should sustain its stance against the “barbarity” of the Syrian government, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said. In an interview with Turkish broadcaster Fox TV, Kurtulmus said Assad’s government must be punished in the international arena and the peace process in Syria needed to be accelerated. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Russia and Iran needed to understand that supporting Assad made no sense and that the escalation of the U.S. military role in Syria was a “warning” to “a criminal regime”. “Use of chemical weapons is appalling and should be punished because it is a war crime,” Ayrault told Reuters and France Info radio. French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued statements saying Assad was solely to blame for the air strikes. The Dutch government said: “The United States has given a clear signal that the use of poison gas crosses a line.” It also labeled the strikes a “proportionate” response. “U.S. strikes show needed resolve against barbaric chemical attacks. EU will work with the US to end brutality in Syria,” the chairman of the council of EU leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Twitter. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the strikes sent “a vitally important message” that the world would not tolerate the use of chemical weapons. “The retribution has been proportionate and it has been swift,” he told reporters in Sydney. “We support the United States in that swift action.” Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which back rebels fighting Assad, said they supported the U.S. strikes and held only the Syrian government responsible for the attacks. Other Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait, also expressed support for the attacks.  Some countries expressed reservations about the U.S. decision to launch strikes without authorization from the U.N. Security Council. Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria. “At the same time, Indonesia is concerned with unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in responding to the chemical weapon attack tragedy in Syria,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir said in a text message. “Military actions, undertaken without prior authorization of the U.N. Security Council, are not in line with international legal principles in the peaceful settlement of disputes, as stipulated in the U.N. Charter.” ",0
"Obama trolls Trump over 'mean tweet' on late night TV  (This October 24 story has been refiled to say “go” instead of “do” in second paragraph) By Roberta Rampton LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday trolled Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump - known for his prolific use of Twitter to settle scores - making Trump the punch line for jokes on ABC’s late-night show “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” Obama read aloud a series of “mean tweets” culminating in one from Trump: “President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!” “At least I will go down as a president,” Obama said. Kimmel joked that Obama had to “take time away from helping rig the election” to appear on the show, a dig at Trump, who has repeatedly said the Nov. 8 vote is rigged against him. Obama picked up on the joke while describing how comedian Bill Murray beat him in a contest to putt golf balls into a glass in the Oval Office during a recent visit - a stunt the White House designed to promote Obamacare health insurance. “He won repeatedly,” Obama said. “The glass was rigged!” Kimmel asked Obama, “Do you ever laugh” when watching Trump on television. “Most of the time,” Obama said. Obama also revealed he has been called on a special phone by his bed “three or four times” in the middle of the night during his time in office to deal with emergencies, including when the 2011 tsunami hit Japan. But he said he does not reach for his smartphone in the wee hours - another dig at the Republican candidate. “I don’t tweet at 3 a.m. about people who insult me,” Obama said. Obama’s second and final term ends on Jan. 20. Under the U.S. constitution, presidents are limited to two terms - which is just as well, Obama said. “If I were able to run for a third term, Michelle would divorce me,” he said, noting his wife does not like politics. Not all the jokes were at Trump’s expense. Comedian Will Farrell channeled deceased but beloved Chicago Cubs sportscaster Harry Caray to recommend that Obama “open a shrimp shack” after he leaves office. And Joel McHale feigned outrage when told he had been bumped from the show for Obama. “You got the president, huh. Wow, that’s a big deal - he’s got two months left in the job,” McHale said, oozing sarcasm. “That’s a real good get there, Jimmy: Lame! Duck!” McHale said. ",0
"Challenges to Trump's immigration orders spread to more U.S. states  (In this Jan. 31 story, in 11th paragraph corrects to show two Iranian plaintiffs are a man and a woman, not two men) By Scott Malone and Dan Levine BOSTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Legal challenges to President Donald Trump’s first moves on immigration spread on Tuesday, with three states suing over his executive order banning travel into the United States by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Washington state joined the legal battle against the travel ban, which the White House deems necessary to improve national security. The challenges contend the order violated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantees of religious freedom. San Francisco became the first U.S. city to sue to challenge a Trump directive to withhold federal money from U.S. cities that have adopted sanctuary policies toward undocumented immigrants, which local officials argue help local police by making those immigrants more willing to report crimes. The legal maneuvers were the latest acts of defiance against executive orders signed by Trump last week that sparked a wave of protests in major U.S. cities, where thousands of people decried the new president’s actions as discriminatory. Both policies are in line with campaign promises by Republican businessman-turned-politician Trump, who vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration and to take hard-line steps to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States. The restrictions on the seven Muslim-majority countries and new limits on refugees have won the support of many Americans, with 49 percent of respondents to a Reuters poll conducted Monday and Tuesday saying they agreed with the order, while 41 percent disagreed. Massachusetts contended the restrictions run afoul of the establishment clause of the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits religious preference. “At bottom, what this is about is a violation of the Constitution,” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said of the order halting travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. The order also barred resettlement of refugees for 120 days and indefinitely banned Syrian refugees. “It discriminates against people because of their religion, it discriminates against people because of their country of origin,” Healey said at a Boston press conference, flanked by leaders from the tech, healthcare and education sectors who said that the order could limit their ability to attract and retain highly educated workers. Massachusetts will be backing a lawsuit filed over the weekend in Boston federal court by two Iranian men who teach at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. A federal judge blocked the government from expelling those men from the country and halted enforcement of the order for seven days, following similar but more limited moves in four other states. The attorneys general of New York and Virginia also said their states were joining similar lawsuits filed in their respective federal courts challenging the ban. “As we speak, there are students at our colleges and universities who are unable to return to Virginia,” Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring told reporters. “This is not an action I take lightly, but it is one I take with confidence in our legal analysis.” On Monday, liberal-leaning Washington state became the first U.S. state to have its attorney general initiate a lawsuit against Trump to challenge the travel ban. Multiple foreign nationals have also filed lawsuits challenging the ban. They included one filed in Colorado on Tuesday by a Libyan college student and two filed in Chicago,  including one on behalf of an Iranian father of three children all living in Illinois. Protests against Trump’s executive action continued on Tuesday in several cities.   A crowd of several thousand demonstrators gathered at the federal courthouse in Minneapolis, chanting “Hey, hey, ho, ho Muslim ban has got to go!” Dozens of protesters chanted the same slogan at Los Angeles International Airport, and more than 400 demonstrators gathered in downtown Miami to protest both the travel ban and Trump’s crackdown on sanctuary cities. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera filed suit over Trump’s order threatening to cut funds to cities with sanctuary policies, a move that could stop the flow of billions of dollars to major U.S. population centers including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. “If allowed to be implemented, this executive order would make our communities less safe. It would make our residents less prosperous, and it would split families apart,” Herrera said. Sanctuary cities adopt policies that limit cooperation, such as refusing to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests. Advocates of the policies say that, beyond helping police with crime reporting, they make undocumented immigrants more willing to serve as witnesses if they do not fear that contact with law enforcement will lead to their deportation. Both the San Francisco and Massachusetts actions contend that Trump’s orders in question violate the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that powers not granted to the federal government should fall to the states. Michael Hethmon, senior counsel with the conservative Immigration Reform Law Institute in Washington, called the San Francisco lawsuit a “silly political gesture,” noting that prior federal court decisions make clear that the U.S. government “can prohibit a policy that essentially impedes legitimate federal programs.” ",0
"Labour leader and other UK lawmakers could lose seats in cost cutting plan LONDON (Reuters) - The leader of Britain s main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, and other politicians could lose their seats if proposals to  cut the cost of politics  go ahead, a report suggested on Tuesday. Under former prime minister David Cameron, the governing Conservative Party pledged to reduce the number of lawmakers from 650 to 600 to make cost savings after criticism of expense claims made by those working in parliament. The independent boundary commission has made proposals to make sure most electoral districts in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are roughly equal in the number of voters, meaning certain seats, like Corbyn s, are set to be abolished. But it is not clear whether parliament will back the plan, which is not due to take effect until 2022.  Since losing the Conservatives  parliamentary majority at an election in June, Prime Minister Theresa May is dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party, the Democratic Unionist Party, which has opposed any changes in earlier votes. Labour has also said it would vote against the measures, accusing the Conservatives of using the review to pursue  their own political advantage .  The Daily Telegraph newspaper said if the changes had been in place before the June election, May s Conservatives would have won a majority. ",0
"In a Corner of the Everglades, a Way of Life Ebbs - The New York Times EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla.  —   As the airboat skimmed across the shallow water, scattering blue dragonflies and launching a heron into the air, Keith Price squinted into the sun and relished the isolation of Florida’s unrivaled river of grass. Then he cut off the deafening motor, making the silence in the park all the sweeter, turned his one working ear my way, and asked, “Isn’t this beautiful?” No answer was required, but the question itself was a kind of lament. Private airboating inside the pristine Everglades National Park, a pastime that stretches back decades, will officially end with Mr. Price and others like him. For Mr. Price, 62, it is the latest broadside against the unique but dwindling culture among devotees of the park known as Gladesmen, their traditions curbed over time by restrictions on hunting and camping, development booms and other   intrusions. “This is the only part of the park where you can ride your own airboat,” said Mr. Price, who calls himself a “citizen of the Everglades” and is the president of the    Airboat Association of Florida. “Why wouldn’t I want to pass this on to my kids and grandkids. ” Beginning this year, federal park officials will restrict airboat use to those who, in 1989, used them regularly in the eastern part of Everglades National Park near Miami. That was the year Congress passed a   law to protect and expand the park by nearly 109, 000 acres, and to help it recover from engineering projects that had left the Everglades starved for water. In keeping with that mission, the law called for the use of airboats in the national park to be phased out. Regulators say the boats can destroy the saw grass prairies and disturb wildlife with their   noise. Airboat owners who were 16 or older in 1989 will most likely be grandfathered and, for the first time, given a permit, said Justin Unger, the park’s deputy superintendent. But the permits expire when their holder dies, guaranteeing the eventual demise of private airboat use inside the park. Mr. Unger said he expected to issue hundreds of such permits, if not more, mostly on an honor system, adding that the park wants to be as generous as possible. The four commercial airboat concessions that ferry tourists around the park will also be affected. The three that own their land will have to sell it to the federal park, but all four can continue to operate under new park rules, Mr. Unger said. The owners are unhappy about having to sell their land and eventually hand over their concessions. “We are trying to enforce the law in the most evolving, respectful way, while still honoring the heritage that exists in South Florida,” Mr. Unger said. In addition, private airboat riding is allowed in several hundred thousand acres of the Everglades that are outside the park’s boundaries, and in stretches of the neighboring Big Cypress National Preserve. But there is something special about Everglades National Park. Folded inside the country’s largest subtropical wilderness, it is a flat 1. 5 million acres of marshland, hardwood hammocks, tangled mangroves and cypress domes on the tip of Florida. A shallow sheet of water flows slowly south from Lake Okeechobee across the saw grass and into Florida Bay, attracting a multitude of wading birds, snakes, alligators, fish and frogs. “There are no other Everglades in the world. They are, they have always been, one of the unique regions of the earth remote, never wholly known,” Marjory Stoneman Douglas marveled in her book “The Everglades: River of Grass” published in 1947. Teeming with mosquitoes and tough to penetrate or tame (even the grass will cut your fingers) the swampy Everglades has long been inhospitable to all but the hardiest. Airboats, built to skim atop the   water with their flat bottoms and   propellers, helped crack open the door. “You can’t see the Everglades if you can’t get in the Everglades,” said Jesse Kennon, owner of Coopertown Airboats, one of the four concessions inside the national park. Some of the Everglades   trace back to the gritty pioneering Gladesmen who settled in the wilderness and survived off the land, much like the Miccosukees and Seminoles before them. Some of these settlers’ descendants live here still, holding tight to traditional habits and culture. Today’s Gladesmen, a largely recreational bunch numbering in the hundreds, do less surviving and more enjoying. They intuit the Everglades  —   their complaints, their equilibrium. They know what can be eaten (the hearts of saw grass leaves). They know how to read the   water trails (and not get lost). They even know how to read the minds of alligators and wrestle them down (at least some do). “He wants to know if you want to go on a walking tour with him,” Mr. Kennon ribbed, nodding at the alligator that swam silently up to the bobbing airboat, stopped and locked eyes with us for several long minutes. Mr. Kennon wrestled his first gator as an    climbing on its back, lifting its chin, then tying up its mouth and legs, a trick he can still handle at 73. He learned the trade from the Miccosukee alligator wrestler Bobby Tiger, who lived on a nearby reservation. Mr. Kennon, who lives in the back of his gift shop in the Everglades, first set foot here as a boy, in the 1950s. He spent summer vacations with a cousin, John Cooper, who had moved to the Everglades from Missouri. Mr. Cooper built a rustic airboat so the family could ride into the swamp to gig bullfrogs they could sell to restaurants or  . In time, the business became Coopertown Airboats, which Mr. Kennon took over in 1981. Soon, film crews and fashion photographers were following him into the photogenic Everglades. “This is how I make a living, off the Glades,” said Mr. Kennon, who wears a gold ring in the shape of a gator. “I’d go out of my mind working in an office. ” It is easy to see what the airboaters love about life inside the park. The canopy of pink, red and orange as the sun sets beyond the grass. The bass fishing trips with buddies in isolated hammocks that once housed hunting camps. The trumpet blast of the bullfrogs. When the Everglades protection law passed in 1989, the members of the Airboat Association of Florida lobbied so effectively to save their land that they got to keep it and their clubhouse. Of the remaining 200 or so members, most are weekenders who use the club’s ramp, hang out in the clubhouse and regularly host visiting Boy Scouts. They view themselves as stewards of the park, and say they will fight the law as long as commercial airboats, which they argue are much larger and more damaging to the park, are allowed to remain. Mr. Price, who goes by his onetime trucker handle, Sawgrass Cowboy, and who could double as Walter Sobchak, a character from the film “The Big Lebowski,” said small,   airboats do not harm the saw grass. And the wildlife adapted to the noise long ago, he said. “The airboat sound matches my wife’s angry voice,” joked Mr. Price, who grew up near the park and said he took his first steps here as a baby. His friend Cecil M. Pierce, 71, who has been airboating for more than three decades, said America has just “too much government,” a common grievance among the club’s members. A few minutes later, Mr. Price snatched a tiny apple from a pond apple flower on park property. Mr. Pierce pointed to the sky and said, “there’s a little drone up there watching you. ” By afternoon’s end, the airboaters navigated back to the club for a beer, happy to have skirted the hustle and bustle of another day. “Some people like the ocean,” Mr. Price said. “We like the Everglades. ”",0
"Trump adviser: TPP 'dead,' will move quickly on bilateral trade deals WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump will not revive his predecessor’s stalled Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in any form, but will quickly pursue bilateral trade agreements, a Trump transition policy adviser said. “TPP is dead. I cannot stress that more strongly,” said the adviser, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly for the administration that takes office on Jan. 20.  “TPP, or a multilateral agreement that looks like TPP but is called something else, is emphatically dead.” On Wednesday, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said he was not opposed to President Barack Obama’s 12-country Pacific Rim trade deal but shared some of Trump’s views “on whether the agreement that was negotiated serves all of America’s interests at best.” Speaking by phone late on Thursday, the Trump adviser said Tillerson was expressing some personal views on free trade theory. The adviser said the administration was not going to pursue multilateral trade deals. “You will be shocked by the speed at which bilateral agreements begin to materialize,” the adviser said. Britain has expressed strong interest in a bilateral trade deal with the United States once it exits the European Union.  Official spokespeople for the Trump transition team did not respond to Reuters’ requests for further comment.  The adviser said he would not rule out declaring China a currency manipulator or levying tariffs on Chinese goods as a means of reducing massive U.S. trade deficits with China. He declined to speculate how quickly a currency designation could come, adding that the issue needed further review. The Trump policy adviser said the new administration is determined to reverse years of Chinese trade practices that have “hollowed out” the U.S. manufacturing base.   “You have to understand the view of this administration that China is essentially perpetrating an economic war, they’re already engaged in a trade war against us,” the adviser said.

"Lithuania gets minority government as junior partner leaves VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania s government lost its majority in parliament on Saturday after its junior coalition partner quit, saying they has been sidelined over policies ranging from alcohol age limits to subsidies on central heating. A parliament vote on next year s budget, expected by early December, will be the first test for the minority government following the departure of the Social Democrats after less than a year in power. The government will need to convince opposition parties to support it on a case-by-case basis. The Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, the sole party remaining in power, have a block of 57 members in Lithuania s 141-seat parliament. The country, once ruled from Moscow but now a member of both the European Union and NATO, is rebuilding its military in the face of an assertive Russia but has found development hampered by emigration and raising wages, eating away at competitiveness.  All preconditions are in place for our government to continue until the next general election in 2020,  Saulius Skvernelis, prime minister since November 2016, told Reuters.  The Social Democrats took a short-sighted and suicidal decision,  he added. Lithuania s Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius, a Social Democrat, told Reuters he will leave his party to continue in the government. At least one of the two other Social Democrat appointees will leave the 15-member government, said Social Democrat chairman Gintautas Paluckas, elected in April this year on a reform mandate.  Relationships within the coalition were bad, our opinions differed on almost all major issues and, since Farmers and Greens looked for votes elsewhere, we had scant possibilities to shape its politics,  he told Reuters.  This will cost us influence in the short term, but we ll be in a position to better represent our supporters in the long term,  he said. The Social Democrats, which have held power for long stretches since Lithuanian independence, have been looking for a way to reconnect with the voters after finishing a distant third in the 2016 general election. Social Democrat rank-and-file overwhelmingly supported leaving the government in a recent poll, in contrast to the party s members of parliament who preferred staying in power. ",0

"For Helping Immigrants, Chobani’s Founder Draws Threats - The New York Times By many measures, Chobani embodies the classic American immigrant success story. Its founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, is a Turkish immigrant of Kurdish descent. He bought a defunct yogurt factory in upstate New York, added a facility in Twin Falls, Idaho, and now employs about 2, 000 people making Greek yogurt. But in this contentious election season, the extreme right has a problem with Chobani: In its view, too many of those employees are refugees. As Mr. Ulukaya has stepped up his advocacy  —   employing more than 300 refugees in his factories, starting a foundation to help migrants, and traveling to the Greek island of Lesbos to witness the crisis firsthand  —   he and his company have been targeted with racist attacks on social media and conspiratorial articles on websites including Breitbart News. Now there are calls to boycott Chobani. Mr. Ulukaya and the company have been taunted with racist epithets on Twitter and Facebook. Fringe websites have published false stories claiming Mr. Ulukaya wants “to drown the United States in Muslims. ” And the mayor of Twin Falls has received death threats, partly as a result of his support for Chobani. Online hate speech is on the rise, reflecting the rising nationalism displayed by some supporters of Donald J. Trump, who has opposed resettling refugees in the United States. “What’s happening with Chobani is one more flash point in this battle between the voices of xenophobia and the voices advocating a rational immigration policy,” said Cecillia Wang, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. Chobani and Mr. Ulukaya declined to comment for this article. The Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment. Mr. Ulukaya arrived in upstate New York in the 1990s to attend school. By 2002, he was making and selling feta cheese inspired by a family recipe. A few years later, he learned that a local yogurt and cheese factory that had closed was for sale. He received a loan of $800, 000 from the Small Business Administration to purchase the factory, and started selling Chobani yogurt in 2007. As the business grew, Mr. Ulukaya needed more help. When he learned there was a refugee resettlement center in a nearby town, he asked if any of the newcomers wanted jobs at Chobani. Mr. Ulukaya provided transportation for the new hires, and he brought in translators to assist them. He paid the refugee workers salaries above the minimum wage, as he did other workers at the factory. When Chobani opened its factory in Twin Falls, Mr. Ulukaya once again turned to a local resettlement center. The company now employs resettled refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey, among other countries. “The minute a refugee has a job, that’s the minute they stop being a refugee,” Mr. Ulukaya said in a talk he gave this year. Today, Chobani has annual yogurt sales of around $1. 5 billion. Last year, Mr. Ulukaya signed the Giving Pledge, promising to give away a majority of his fortune to assist refugees. Chobani and the other companies working with refugees are not exploiting them, said Jennifer Patterson, project director for the Partnership for Refugees, a federal program. “It’s the exact opposite,” Ms. Patterson said. “These companies are looking to provide resettled refuges with the ability to live happy and productive lives. ” Chobani’s work with refugees went largely unnoticed until this January, when Mr. Ulukaya spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. His message  —   that corporations needed to do more to assist refugees  —   broke through the   rhetoric. “He was quite a sensation there,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who attended the event. “Here was someone who went beyond the   chatter of Davos and was walking the walk. ” Cisco, IBM, Salesforce and more joined others in pledging assistance to refugees. Those companies and others began working with the Tent Foundation, which Mr. Ulukaya founded last year. Chobani has pledged to help other companies learn how to effectively integrate refugees into a work force. But while an alliance of   companies was now working together on the issue, the online critics zeroed in on Chobani. Shortly after Mr. Ulukaya spoke in Davos, the   website WND published a story originally titled “American Yogurt Tycoon Vows to Choke U. S. With Muslims. ” Then this summer, Breitbart, the conservative news website whose former executive chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, is now running the Trump campaign, began publishing a series of misleading articles about Chobani. One drew a connection between Chobani’s hiring of refugees and a spike in tuberculosis cases in Idaho. Another linked Chobani to a “Twin Falls Crisis Imposed by     Advocates. ” A third conflated Chobani’s hiring practices with a sexual assault case in Twin Falls involving minors. As Breitbart began publishing its articles, the online attacks grew more intense. On Twitter and Facebook, users called for a boycott of Chobani. An image was widely shared on social media that claimed Mr. Ulukaya was “going to drown the United States in Muslims and is importing them to Idaho 300 at a time to work in his factory. ” And bloggers fabricated stories claiming that Chobani was pressuring local officials “to facilitate their multitude of Muslim   requests. ” Soon the mayor of Twin Falls, Shawn Barigar, found himself at the center of a conspiracy theory. “It got woven into a narrative that it’s all a   that we’re all trying to keep the refugees safe so that Chobani has its work force, that I personally am getting money from the Obama administration to help Chobani hire whoever they want, that it’s part of this Islamification of the United States,” he said. “It’s crazy. ” As the online comments escalated this summer, Mr. Barigar and his wife received death threats. Breitbart said it was simply covering the news. “Breitbart has been a leader in delivering important and breaking news on refugee crises throughout the Western world, which pose both national security and financial risks,” Alex Marlow, editor in chief, said in a statement. “Mr. Ulukaya hasn’t merely involved himself in this issue, he’s been one of the leaders in expanding refugee resettlement in the United States. Breitbart’s explosive growth is due in large measure to the mainstream media’s refusal to cover vital topics like this one. ” But civil rights advocates said they believed it was no mystery why Mr. Ulukaya was targeted while other chief executives had been spared. “It’s because he’s an immigrant himself,” Ms. Wang of the A. C. L. U. said. Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch attributed some of the xenophobia directed at Chobani to the election season. “Some people are feeling left behind, and some people are concerned about terrorists,” he said. “But Trump has given a voice to these sentiments. ” Mr. Barigar, a Democrat, concurred. “Donald Trump really fueled a sentiment about immigration that is shared by a very small part of our community,” he said. “We are an agricultural center. We’ve depended on immigrants for a   or more. ” Mr. Ulukaya appears undeterred. In September, he participated in a   discussion with President Obama and business leaders on how corporations could do more to help refugees. And his work with refugees is part of a broader suite of initiatives. He recently gave 10 percent of Chobani shares to his employees, and he is offering paid parental leave to all employees. “He’s the xenophobe’s nightmare,” Mr. Roth said. “Here’s an immigrant who isn’t competing for jobs, but is creating jobs big time. It runs completely counter to the   narrative. ”",0
"DoD teams surveying US military sites for potential Gitmo transfers, lawmakers vow fight The Department of Defense notified lawmakers Friday that teams will visit two military installations in the United States — Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and the Naval Brig in Charleston, S.C. — to conduct “site surveys” looking into transferring a “limited number” of Guantanamo detainees, Pentagon and Capitol Hill sources told Fox News.

The move, coming on the same day Secretary of State John Kerry marked the re-opening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, has already triggered a backlash on Capitol Hill. But, despite existing congressional restrictions on moving the detainees to U.S. soil, the notice itself suggests officials are wasting no time exploring transfer options for those at the controversial Cuba prison camp.

One Capitol Hill source, reading from the notification, said the first Defense Department survey team was due to visit Fort Leavenworth “starting today [Friday].”

The Naval Brig in Charleston will be visited in the “next several weeks,” said another source, reading from the same notification, which went out Friday morning.

Legally, the administration is still barred from transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States, according to laws passed by Congress starting in 2010. Building or modifying facilities to house Gitmo inmates is also prohibited in the United States.

“Perhaps DoD does not think this is part of that ‘build or modify’ section,” one source told Fox News, questioning DoD’s funding of the site survey teams visiting the two military installations.

After learning of the survey teams, lawmakers representing Kansas vowed to fight any proposed transfers to their state. Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said in a statement that the move ""reflects another egregious overstep by this administration.""

""Congress has consistently stopped Obama by law from moving a single detainee to the U.S.,"" he said. ""Not on my watch will any terrorist be placed in Kansas.""

""Terrorists should not be living down the road from Ft. Leavenworth – home to thousands of Army soldiers and their families, as well as military personnel from across the globe who study at the Intellectual Center of the Army,"" Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said in a statement.

""This administration’s last-ditch effort to carry out President Obama’s reckless national security decision before he leaves office is disingenuous and flawed.""

Kansas Rep. Lynn Jenkins also fired off a letter to Defense Secretary Ash Carter demanding he abandon any such plans.

""At a time when we face relentless threats from the Islamic State, and have yet to hear a strategy to defeat ISIL, it is absurd to hear that the Department of Defense has personnel on the ground at Fort Leavenworth conducting site surveys to advance the President's proposal that could ultimately result in the transfer of these terrorist to Kansas,"" she said in a statement.

She also said moving detainees stateside would violate federal law. ""It is irresponsible, reckless, and to overstep the law to do so is a dangerous precedent,"" the congresswoman said.

Despite the congressional restrictions, President Obama still wants to fulfill his pledge to shutter the Cuba prison camp. He hasn’t yet provided a plan for achieving this to Congress. A total of 116 detainees remain at Guantanamo, 52 of whom have been approved for transfer.

The Pentagon confirmed to Fox News that DoD personnel will survey the two military sites, “as part of our broader and ongoing effort to identify locations within the United States that can [possibly] facilitate military commissions and can possibly hold detainees currently at Guantanamo Bay.”

Defense Department spokesman Cmdr. Gary Ross said in a statement that security and humane treatment are “primary concerns” but cost is also a factor. He said the costs of providing medical care at Guantanamo, for instance, are rising as the population ages.

He added: “Only those locations that can hold detainees at a maximum security level will be considered. DoD personnel will consider surveying a variety of military and civilian sites to determine their candidacy for holding law of war detainees in a humane and secure manner. There is a broad list of facilities that will be potentially considered. This list is informed by past assessment efforts.""

Whether the administration can reach an agreement with Congress to approve transfers to the U.S. remains to be seen.

The notice sent out Friday -- first reported by Voice of America -- said the teams will look at logistical issues: “The assessment team will meet with facility staff to discuss engineering, force protection, troop housing, security, transportation, information security, contracting and other operational issues.”

“No facilities have been selected,” the notification added.

"German Police Kill Assailant After Ax Attack Aboard a Train - The New York Times WEIMAR, Germany  —   A    Afghan youth who came to Germany as a migrant last year attacked several passengers with an ax and a knife on a train in the south of the country late on Monday, injuring at least four people, while 14 others were treated for shock, the police said. After the train made an emergency stop, the attacker fled and was pursued by police officers, who fatally shot him, according to the interior minister of the state of Bavaria, Joachim Herrmann. The motive for the attack remained unclear. The young man had entered Germany without his parents and applied for asylum, Mr. Herrmann said. According to government figures, more than 14, 400 unaccompanied minors arrived last year among the more than one million migrants who entered the country. Mr. Herrmann said the attacker had initially lived in a group home, but had most recently been taken in by a foster family. The German authorities have worked to place as many of the minors as possible with families, in hopes of helping them to better integrate into society. Mr. Herrmann, speaking to ZDF public television by telephone, said the authorities could not confirm local news reports that the teenager had shouted “Allahu akbar” during the assault. “There are hints that may indicate a terrorist background, but these have not yet been proven,” Mr. Herrmann said. “There are many witnesses many people were sitting in the train. There are also the many police who responded and confronted the perpetrator and shot him, who are also important witnesses. ” The train was traveling from Treuchtlingen in Bavaria to Würzburg when the attack occurred, the German federal police in Würzburg said. In addition to the four wounded during the attack, 14 passengers were treated for psychological shock, the police said. As the police, including a team of special forces who happened to be in the city, moved in on the teenager, he charged them, and the police opened fire, Mr. Herrmann said. Last month, the police killed an armed assailant who had taken several hostages at a multiplex movie theater in the western German city of Viernheim. Germany has not experienced attacks on the same scale as France or Belgium, but it remains on edge amid threats on social media by Islamic extremists. Several plots have been foiled by the police. In May, a    German killed one man and injured three others with a knife while shouting “Allahu akbar” on a commuter train in a suburb of Munich. After questioning him, the authorities said that he had no known links to Islamic extremism and that they believed he was mentally disturbed. Fears have been running high that terrorists may have been among those entering the country last year. Coming just days after a Tunisian using a truck killed 84 people in Nice, France, Monday night’s attack could have political ramifications. Germans, who arrived in droves at train stations and bus stops to welcome the migrants arriving last year, have since grown increasingly fearful. Worries spiked after North African migrants were linked to dozens of sexual assaults on German women in Cologne on New Year’s Eve.",0
"Austria Spearheads Balkan Frontier Defence Project Austria is joining forces with 15 other Eastern European countries to stem the flow of migrants northwards, as they believe the European Union (EU) has failed in its duty to protect the region’s borders. [Under the banner of the Balkan Frontier Defence Project, the countries will ensure that their police and military forces are in constant contact to ensure the vigilant protection of the national borders northwards of Greece, and repelling illegal immigrants from those borders.  Austrian Defence Minister   Doskozil (SPÖ) told Die Welt: “We do not believe that the EU’s external borders are adequately protected so far by the EU. That is why Austria, together with 15 other countries along the Balkan route and the Visegrád states, is planning a close cooperation in the framework of a new Balkan frontier defence project. “If there is a mass influx of migrants, the states involved in the border protection initiative want to be able to act quickly. In the event of a crisis, we will work towards a common situation using clearly defined contacts and a regular exchange of information between the police and military heads of the countries involved. ” To strengthen Austria’s capacity to respond, the minister is also working on a change in the law which would allow the country to send troops abroad. Currently, Austrian troops can only be dispatched for humanitarian missions, but he said the government would like to widen their scope. “Austria is ready to offer countries both inside and outside the EU, not only for humanitarian reasons but also for the protection of their borders, if these countries ask us to do so and we have sufficient capacities,” he said. The moves are being made, Doskozil said, because the amount of illegal smuggling taking place in the Balkans and the number of migrants are both still “significant”. At present, between 500 and 1, 000 migrants are arriving in Austria each week, but the minister said the situation could deteriorate rapidly at any time thanks to the fragile nature of the EU’s deal with Turkey. “We must intensely prepare now for the [Turkish] government’s reopening of the sluices in Ankara, which President Erdoğan has already threatened several times to do,” Doskozil said, adding: “Erdoğan is not a reliable partner of the EU. ” He went on to criticise the current number of illegal migrants in the EU as “too high” calling for much more to be done to bring down their numbers. “Return centres, higher penalties for asylum seekers who violate the rules, and massive cuts in illegal immigrants’ money would all be appropriate means,” he suggested, calling for an “EU repatriation summit” to be convened to discuss   action across Europe. “The previous initiatives, such as the stronger role for Frontex in repatriation, are far from sufficient,” he said. “It would be best to have a European repatriation officer of rank and name, who could take on this important issue. ”",0
"New York City budget boss to state: We're not a 'piggy bank' NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City’s fiscal watchdog said the city faces much bigger budget deficits in coming years than the mayor has forecast and warned state lawmakers about treating the city like a “piggy bank.” The state, like the city, is finalizing its budget and will soon make decisions affecting New York City. “Some upstate legislators just don’t get it,” New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said during his review of the city budget on Wednesday. “They see New York City as their piggy bank.”  Stringer cautioned against last-minute, late-night budget decisions that could deprive the city of resources. His comments reflected growing frustration with state lawmakers over their suggestions that the city is flush with cash after a stronger economic recovery than other parts of the state. New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has had a tense relationship with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, persuading his fellow Democrat last year to pay $2.5 billion toward the city’s public transportation system, which is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency. There have also been suggestions in the state capital that the city could do more to fund healthcare costs and pay more for the city’s university system. New York State legislators are known for “vampire” budget sessions that go into the early hours to beat the budget deadline at the start of the state’s fiscal year on April 1. Stringer said that although next year’s budget remained balanced, the total gaps forecast through fiscal year 2020 are $1 billion more than the mayor’s office had predicted. “Budget monitors and rating agencies have all applauded this administration’s fiscal prudence and focus on protecting against economic uncertainty – and investors agree,” said Amy Spitalnick, a spokesperson for de Blasio.  The mayor’s office points out that Stringer projects $900 million in additional tax revenue for this financial year and next, and cites that as an example of cautious revenue projections on the city’s part. Stringer said the mayor should not have included $731 million from the sale of taxi medallions through 2020, saying the taxi business is currently in upheaval. The city has already cut it expectations for revenue from taxi medallion sales but Stringer has been more aggressive in elimintaing it from later years. He also said some taxes would be lower than the mayor is predicting and that costs for overtime, healthcare and homeless shelters would be higher. ",0
"Why Long Voting Lines Could Have Long-Term Consequences - The New York Times In Charlotte, N. C. the lines for the first wave of early balloting last month forced some voters to wait more than two hours. In Las Vegas last weekend, voters were still waiting outside a polling place in a Mexican grocery store two hours after it was set to close. In New York City on Election Day, voters who spilled out of polling sites snaked through schoolyards and around entire city blocks. There are two ways to interpret these scenes. “It does give some indication of the health of our democracy that you have all these people who are excited enough to vote that they’ll wait in a long line,” said Stephen Pettigrew, a Ph. D. candidate in Harvard’s department of government who studies polling lines. “But it’s also an indication, at least in some areas, that there is a problem. ” One problem is that some groups are much more likely to face long lines than others. Another, according to Mr. Pettigrew’s research on recent elections, is that the people who do wait are less likely to vote in the future as a result. Early voters, urban voters and minority voters are all more likely to wait and wait and wait. In predominantly minority communities, the lines are about twice as long as in predominantly white ones, Mr. Pettigrew has found. And minority voters are six times as likely as whites to wait longer than an hour to vote. Those disparities have persisted even within the same town or county, suggesting they don’t reflect simply the greater difficulty of putting on elections in populous cities. “That means members of minority communities are forgoing wages they’re having to juggle child and family care and all sorts of other things that white voters don’t have to do,” said Charles Stewart III, an M. I. T. political scientist. (In a presidential election, he has estimated, all this waiting nationwide adds up to a billion dollars in lost wages.) Voting essentially costs people more in minority communities, and that also makes them particularly susceptible to the long wait’s other effect. Mr. Pettigrew’s research suggests that for each hour   voters wait, their probability of voting in the next election drops by one percentage point. That may not sound like a lot, but Mr. Pettigrew estimates that this means 200, 000 people didn’t vote in 2014 because of the lines they encountered in 2012 (and that’s accounting for the lower turnout we’d expect in a midterm election). Even the most effective     tactics budge turnout by only three or four percentage points, at best. So long lines are a relatively powerful way to influence behavior. In concerns over minority turnout in particular, the public’s focus has fallen much more on the consequences of stricter voter ID laws and fewer early voting days. But long lines can have a similar effect, depressing turnout too. Mr. Pettigrew, whose data also shows that predominantly white precincts tend to receive more voting machines and poll workers, doesn’t argue that these patterns necessarily prove discrimination. Election officials may have reacted slowly, for example, to shifting dynamics in who votes. Historically, white turnout has been higher than black turnout  —   a pattern broken for the first time in 2012. But regardless of whether party officials are actively trying to depress minority turnout  —   a question litigated extensively over the last several years as the Supreme Court has weakened the Voting Rights Act  —   the effective outcome of these disparities matters. “I can understand long lines randomly appearing in places because of weird idiosyncratic forces,” Mr. Pettigrew said. “I think it’s not O. K. for there to be this systematic pattern in certain areas of long lines. ” For the vast majority of voters, this issue never arises. In 2012, voters waited an average of about 14 minutes to cast a ballot. Only about 5 percent waited longer than an hour. But that small fraction, in a presidential election, is several million voters. Those voters might be deterred in the future for several reasons. As the costs of voting rise, research suggests, people are less likely to do so. And many of us vote not because we think we’ll cast the deciding ballot, but for the civic experience  —   the chance to get that sticker, to join in the communal exercise, to feel patriotic. If the experience itself (or the customer service around it) is unpleasant, that undercuts one of the main reasons to do it. Mr. Stewart’s own surveys also show that people who wait longer to vote have less confidence that their votes are counted accurately. As a result, long waits may signal to voters that the entire election system is flawed. Just as unfair traffic stops can test faith in the criminal justice system, dysfunctional lines may undermine belief in American elections. And so why vote next time? In North Carolina, where a federal court struck down voting restrictions that it said targeted blacks with “almost surgical precision,” there were reports this election of black voters who encountered long lines and gave up. “In America, we have heightened awareness about racial disparities,” Mr. Stewart said. “And isn’t it really sad to say here’s yet another area in which the racial disparities exist, particularly in light of the fact that one of the top goals of   political activism for a century has been access to the poll. ”",0

TRUMP ADVISORS TRY TO PIVOT NOT FISHTAIL

 HOLLYWOOD, FLA. – It’s a fine line between a general election shift and the dreaded ‘Etch A Sketch.’

Donald Trump’s supporters give him broad latitude on issues and even his promise of an attitudinal change. For example, his suggestion that the Republicans should become a pro-choice party likely wrinkled few brows among his core supporters.

The idea that Trump would change his attitude and approach along with his opinions wouldn’t trouble many who have faith in him as a man and a leader. For those who believe the Trump is the only person who can make America great again, putting on a new guise for the general election would be nothing troubling.

Remember, these are people who believe him when he describes himself as the new Reagan and the person more presidential than anybody since Lincoln.

But can Trump create a habitat that is healthy for both his backers and the kinds of folks that his newly expanded campaign are schmoozing here in Hollywood without further antagonizing the substantial chunk of his party that ranges from resentful to outright outraged about Trump’s surprising success in overtaking the GOP?

Trump had a very good day here Thursday. Aside from turning back a Rules Committee vote that might’ve helped Sen. Ted Cruz win a floor fight at the convention, delegates and other members of the establishment were very impressed by Trump’s campaign’s effort to start sucking up to them.

Promises of Trump’s flexibility when served alongside seafood platters and open bars from his new K Street handlers went a long way toward convincing the GOP elite that Trump is ready to play ball.

Little could be more comforting to them than the pledge from Trump’s campaign boss that the wildness of the frontrunner to this point has been a put on.

Consultants and party elders are not uncomfortable with the idea of tricking rubes or profit and or patriotism. And for those facing general election oblivion, anything that sounds like avoiding a savage showdown in Cleveland and not losing the general election by 40 states sounds good.

But even if Trump and his new handlers can keep the GOP elite and his existing populist base happy, the current maneuvers do pose a risk.

The most important thing for the Republican frontrunner right now is for his detractors and enemies on the conservative side of the party to just give up.

There are enough Republicans who loathe Trump to still stop him. But they have to go vote and they have to be willing to blow up their conventions to do it.

When Trump’s new Sherpa suggests that it has all been a fake so far, that gives new cause for alarm to the conservatives who already deeply mistrust Trump and see him as more of a Democrat than Republican.

All Trump needs in order to win is for the resistance to just lay down for a couple of weeks. When they wake up it will all be over.

But if Trump starts fishtailing in his turn towards conventionality it will reinvigorate the #NeverTrump movement.  

 

 It’s great to suck up to the party, even belatedly, but doing in such a transparent manner could be hazardous to Trump’s nomination.

 Indiana shaping up as do or die for Cruz - RCP: “Due to a dearth of public polling in Indiana, however, it’s not clear how large Cruz’s advantage might be, if he indeed has one. One recent private poll not affiliated with any of the presidential campaigns showed Cruz leading in two congressional districts, Kasich in one, and Trump dominating in two more. Three other congressional districts, meanwhile, showed Cruz and Kasich essentially tied…Although there are just 57 delegates at stake in Indiana, the contest is one of the few remaining wild cards on the primary map. If Cruz or Kasich do not win, the Republican race could quickly spiral out of their control. If Trump does not win Indiana, however, his delegate math becomes exceedingly difficult to win the nomination before Cleveland.”

WHAT HAPPENED TO WORKING MAN’S LIBERALISM?

 Vox’s Emmet Rensin takes a deep dive into a concept he dubs “smug style” liberalism in America and how the political concept changed from an ideology of the working class to that of the elite. How did this happen and what has the smug style done to American liberalism? This lengthy piece goes into the origins and results of the shift in American political thought:

 

 “The smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography. Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, the working class, once the core of the coalition, began abandoning the Democratic Party…In 1964, it was 55 percent of working-class voters. By 1980, it was 35 percent…The smug recognize one another by their mutual knowing…It is the smug style’s first premise: a politics defined by a command of the Correct Facts and signaled by an allegiance to the Correct Culture…So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class, they will search for reasons to justify that failure. They will resent them. They will find, over and over, how easy it is to justify abandoning them further.  They will choose the smug style.”

"Zimbabwe's Mugabe resigns, ending four decades of rule HARARE (Reuters) - Robert Mugabe resigned as Zimbabwe s president on Tuesday, a week after the army and his former political allies moved to end four decades of rule by a man once feted as an independence hero who became feared as a despot. His former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking this month prompted the military takeover that forced Mugabe out, will be sworn in as president on Wednesday or Thursday, Patrick Chinamasa, legal secretary of the ruling ZANU-PF party, told Reuters. The 93-year-old Mugabe had clung on for a week after an army takeover, with ZANU-PF urging him to go. He finally resigned moments after parliament began an impeachment process seen as the only legal way to force him out. Wild celebrations broke out at a joint sitting of parliament when Speaker Jacob Mudenda read out Mugabe s brief resignation letter. Mugabe, confined to his Harare residence, did not appear.  People danced in the streets of Harare and car horns blared at the news that the era of Mugabe   who had led Zimbabwe since independence in 1980   was finally over. Some brandished posters of Mnangagwa and army chief General Constantino Chiwenga.   Workers turned the Christmas lights on early in Africa Unity Square and people climbed aboard armored vehicles to pose for photographs with soldiers. Despite the public outpouring of joy, Mugabe s downfall was as much the result of in-fighting among the political elite as a popular uprising, although thousands of people rallied against him in the days after the army intervened last week.     The army seized power after Mugabe sacked Mnangagwa, ZANU-PF s favorite to succeed him, in a bid to smooth a path to the presidency for his wife Grace, 52, known to her critics as  Gucci Grace  for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping. Since the crisis began, Mugabe has been mainly confined to his  Blue Roof  mansion in the capital where Grace is also believed to be. ZANU-PF chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters that Mnangagwa would be sworn in within 48 hours and serve the remainder of Mugabe s term until the next election, which must be held by September 2018.      I am very happy with what has happened,  said Maria Sabawu, a supporter of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), outside the hotel where the impeachment process was happening.  I have suffered a lot at the hands of Mugabe s government,  she said, showing her hand with a missing finger that she said was lost in violence during a presidential run-off election between Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2008. Mugabe had led Zimbabwe since a guerrilla struggle ended white-minority rule in the country formerly known as Rhodesia. He took the once-rich nation to economic ruin, presiding over the forced takeover of white-owned farms at the end of the century, which devastated agricultural foreign exchange earnings and led to hyperinflation. But brandishing his anti-colonial credentials and styling himself the Grand Old Man of African politics, Mugabe retained the admiration of many people across the continent. Amnesty International said that under Mugabe tens of thousands of people were tortured, forcibly disappeared or killed in a culture of impunity that allowed  grotesque crimes to thrive .  The people of Zimbabwe deserve better. The next generation of leaders must commit itself to upholding the constitution, living up to Zimbabwe s international human rights obligations and treating its people with dignity and justice,  the rights group said in a statement.  Mnangagwa, 75, who fled Zimbabwe after his sacking in fear for his safety, was a chief lieutenant to Mugabe for decades and himself stands accused of participating in repression. He was internal security chief in the mid-1980s when Mugabe deployed a North Korean-trained brigade against rebels during which 20,000 civilians were killed, according to rights groups. Reuters reported in September that Mnangagwa was plotting to succeed Mugabe, with army backing, at the helm of a broad coalition to seek Zimbabwe s re-engagement with the world after decades of isolation from global lenders and donors. Nicknamed  Ngwena , or crocodile in the Shona language, an animal famed in Zimbabwean lore for its stealth and ruthlessness, Mnangagwa issued a statement from hiding on Tuesday calling on Zimbabweans to unite to rebuild the country. Opposition politician and former education minister David Coltart said that call gave hope of lifting a shattered economy from its knees, provided Mnangagwa made good on his promise to reach out to other factions.  When we all wake up with hangovers tomorrow, we will be reminded of the dreadful state our nation is in - no money in the banks and businesses collapsing,  Coltart told Reuters.  As Emmerson Mnangagwa said, ZANU-PF is not capable of resolving this issue on its own. I took some comfort from his words. If he translates them into action, the future is positive.  Zimbabwe s Platform for Concerned Citizens, a civil society group, called for a national dialogue and a  transitional authority  to decide the country s future. Theresa May, prime minister of former colonial power Britain, said Mugabe s resignation  provides Zimbabwe with an opportunity to forge a new path free of the oppression that characterized his rule . She said Britain, as  Zimbabwe s oldest friend , would do all it could to support the country.      The U.S. embassy in Harare said Zimbabwe was living  a historic moment .  Whatever short-term arrangements the government may establish, the path forward must lead to free, fair and inclusive elections,  it said in a statement. ",0
"Nuclear Option-The Speech: Trump Rendering Sullen Democrats Irrelevant - Breitbart The president opened by celebrating Black History Month. Lady Democrats wore white. [Donald Trump delivered the most finely crafted speech of his political life Tuesday night in what will go down as one of the best speeches delivered to a joint session of Congress in the past two decades.  He hit stirring emotional high notes. And he laid out his vision for his presidency. Mr. Trump stole the issue of affordable health care from Democrats. He unabashedly owned the fight against illegal immigration. “Obamacare is collapsing  —   and we must act decisively to protect all Americans,” he said. “Action is not a choice  —   it is a necessity. ” In other words, Democrats led by President Obama swindled poor Americans into this disastrous program with their usual host of lies and false promises, and now these good people are stranded. But Mr. Trump and Republicans are not going to leave these innocent Americans to dig themselves out of the mess Democrats put them in. “So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. ” When the camera panned to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  —   who, inexplicably, is still the Democratic leader in the House  —   she looked like she had been sucking on the bitterest of lemons. Strategically, it was brilliant. It completely cuts Democrats out of the debate. And then the president’s salute to Megan Crowley, who is alive today because of the herculean efforts by her father to find a drug to combat Pompe disease, sealed the deal. Mr. Trump then laid out the broad brush parameters of a health care law he would like to see Republicans hammer out to replace Obamacare. On illegal immigration, Mr. Trump held firm. “To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or a loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defends its borders?” Another question he might have asked those in Congress who do not believe in enforcing immigration laws: “If you don’t like the immigration laws, why don’t you change them? You are the only branch of government that can. ” Mr. Trump also deplored the hellfire violence in Chicago and called education “the civil rights issue of our time. ” The senator from Illinois and other Democrats offered only the most paltry, perfunctory applause. The entire speech was supremely presidential. But it wasn’t without humor. After excoriating both Democrats and Republicans for spending $6 trillion in the Middle East, he said, “We could have rebuilt our country  —   twice. ” He waited two beats. “And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to   …     negotiate,” Mr. Trump said, dropping into his finest “Apprentice” tone of voice. The camera panned to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was exchanging perplexed glances with an equally befuddled senator. They didn’t get the line. Apparently, Ms. Warren never achieved her merit badge for reading smoke signals. In the end, Donald Trump so dominated the entire night that Democrats were left with nothing but sullen protests. The ladies wore white, but nobody was exactly sure why. In a shocking development, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not doze off during the hourlong address. At least not on national television. She did not show up. And in another development that absolutely nobody cared about, Rep. Eliot Engel, New York Democrat, announced he would not shake Mr. Trump’s hand. It was not clear at press time if Mr. Trump even knows who Eliot Engel is. There were so many protests on the Democratic side of the aisle, it was hard to keep track. Even the Democrats seemed confused about what they were protesting. Rep. Joseph Crowley, New York Democrat, wore a giant pin protesting, well, not sure exactly what. It simply featured a large question mark. In all honesty, that pin could be the party’s entire platform in the next election. • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes. com follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.",0
"Donald Trump Tax Records Show He Could Have Avoided Taxes for Nearly Two Decades, The Times Found - The New York Times Donald J. Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years, records obtained by The New York Times show. The 1995 tax records, never before disclosed, reveal the extraordinary tax benefits that Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, derived from the financial wreckage he left behind in the early 1990s through mismanagement of three Atlantic City casinos, his   foray into the airline business and his   purchase of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. Tax experts hired by The Times to analyze Mr. Trump’s 1995 records said that tax rules especially advantageous to wealthy filers would have allowed Mr. Trump to use his $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over an   period. Although Mr. Trump’s taxable income in subsequent years is as yet unknown, a $916 million loss in 1995 would have been large enough to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income over 18 years. The $916 million loss certainly could have eliminated any federal income taxes Mr. Trump otherwise would have owed on the $50, 000 to $100, 000 he was paid for each episode of “The Apprentice,” or the roughly $45 million he was paid between 1995 and 2009 when he was chairman or chief executive of the publicly traded company he created to assume ownership of his troubled Atlantic City casinos. Ordinary investors in the new company, meanwhile, saw the value of their shares plunge to 17 cents from $35. 50, while scores of contractors went unpaid for work on Mr. Trump’s casinos and casino bondholders received pennies on the dollar. “He has a vast benefit from his destruction” in the early 1990s, said one of the experts, Joel Rosenfeld, an assistant professor at New York University’s Schack Institute of Real Estate. Mr. Rosenfeld offered this description of what he would advise a client who came to him with a tax return like Mr. Trump’s: “Do you realize you can create $916 million in income without paying a nickel in taxes?” Mr. Trump declined to comment on the documents. Instead, the campaign released a statement that neither challenged nor confirmed the $916 million loss. “Mr. Trump is a   businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,” the statement said. “That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes. ” The statement continued, “Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it. ” Separately, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Marc E. Kasowitz, emailed a letter to The Times arguing that publication of the records is illegal because Mr. Trump has not authorized the disclosure of any of his tax returns. Mr. Kasowitz threatened “prompt initiation of appropriate legal action. ” Mr. Trump’s refusal to make his tax returns public  —   breaking with decades of tradition in presidential contests  —   has emerged as a central issue in the campaign, with a majority of voters saying he should release them. Mr. Trump has declined to do so, and has said he is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. At last Monday’s presidential debate, when Hillary Clinton suggested Mr. Trump was refusing to release his tax returns so voters would not know “he’s paid nothing in federal taxes,” and when she also pointed out that Mr. Trump had once revealed to casino regulators that he paid no federal income taxes in the late 1970s, Mr. Trump retorted, “That makes me smart. ” The tax experts consulted by The Times said nothing in the 1995 documents suggested any wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, even if the extraordinary size of the loss he declared would have probably attracted extra scrutiny from I. R. S. examiners. “The I. R. S. when they see a negative $916 million, that has to pop out,” Mr. Rosenfeld said. The documents examined by The Times represent a small fraction of the voluminous tax returns Mr. Trump would have filed in 1995. The documents consisted of three pages from what appeared to be Mr. Trump’s 1995 tax returns. The pages were mailed last month to Susanne Craig, a reporter at The Times who has written about Mr. Trump’s finances. The documents were the first page of a New York State resident income tax return, the first page of a New Jersey nonresident tax return and the first page of a Connecticut nonresident tax return. Each page bore the names and Social Security numbers of Mr. Trump and Marla Maples, his wife at the time. Only the New Jersey form had what appeared to be their signatures. The three documents arrived by mail at The Times with a postmark indicating they had been sent from New York City. The return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower. On Wednesday, The Times presented the tax documents to Jack Mitnick, a lawyer and certified public accountant who handled Mr. Trump’s tax matters for more than 30 years, until 1996. Mr. Mitnick was listed as the preparer on the New Jersey tax form. Mr. Mitnick, 80, now semiretired and living in Florida, said that while he no longer had access to Mr. Trump’s original returns, the documents appeared to be authentic copies of portions of Mr. Trump’s 1995 tax returns. Mr. Mitnick said the signature on the tax preparer line of the New Jersey tax form was his, and he readily explained an obvious anomaly in the way especially large numbers appeared on the New York tax document. A flaw in the tax software program he used at the time prevented him from being able to print a   loss on Mr. Trump’s New York return, he said. So, for example, the loss of “729, 293” on Line 18 of the return printed out as “5, 729, 293. ” As a result, Mr. Mitnick recalled, he had to use his typewriter to manually add the “” thus explaining why the first two digits appeared to be in a different font and were slightly misaligned from the following seven digits. “This is legit,” he said, stabbing a finger into the document. Because the documents sent to The Times did not include any pages from Mr. Trump’s 1995 federal tax return, it is impossible to determine how much he may have donated to charity that year. The state documents do show, though, that Mr. Trump declined the opportunity to contribute to the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial Fund, the New Jersey Wildlife Conservation Fund or the Children’s Trust Fund. He also declined to contribute $1 toward public financing of New Jersey’s elections for governor. The tax documents also do not shed any light on Mr. Trump’s claimed net worth of about $2 billion at that time. This is because the complex calculations of business deductions that produced a tax loss of $916 million are a separate matter from how Mr. Trump valued his assets, the tax experts said. Nor does the $916 million loss suggest that Mr. Trump was insolvent or effectively bankrupt in 1995. The cash flow generated by his various businesses that year was more than enough to service his various debts. But fragmentary as they are, the documents nonetheless provide new insight into Mr. Trump’s finances, a subject of intense scrutiny given Mr. Trump’s emphasis on his business record during the presidential campaign. The documents show, for example, that while Mr. Trump reported $7. 4 million in interest income in 1995, he made only $6, 108 in wages, salaries and tips. They also suggest Mr. Trump took full advantage of generous tax loopholes specifically available to commercial real estate developers to claim a $15. 8 million loss in 1995 on his real estate holdings and partnerships. But the most important revelation from the 1995 tax documents is just how much Mr. Trump may have benefited from a tax provision that is particularly prized by America’s dynastic families, which, like the Trumps, hold their wealth inside byzantine networks of partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations. The provision, known as net operating loss, or N. O. L. allows a dizzying array of deductions, business expenses, real estate depreciation, losses from the sale of business assets and even operating losses to flow from the balance sheets of those partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations onto the personal tax returns of men like Mr. Trump. In turn, those losses can be used to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income from, say, book royalties or branding deals. Better still, if the losses are big enough, they can cancel out taxable income earned in other years. Under I. R. S. rules in 1995, net operating losses could be used to wipe out taxable income earned in the three years before and the 15 years after the loss. (The effect of net operating losses on state income taxes varies, depending on each state’s tax regime.) The tax experts consulted by The Times said the $916 million net operating loss declared by Mr. Trump in 1995 almost certainly included large net operating losses carried forward from the early 1990s, when most of Mr. Trump’s key holdings were hemorrhaging money. Indeed, by 1990, his entire business empire was on the verge of collapse. In a few short years, he had amassed $3. 4 billion in debt  —   personally guaranteeing $832 million of it  —   to assemble a portfolio that included three casinos and a hotel in Atlantic City, the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, an airline and a huge yacht. Reports that year by New Jersey casino regulators gave glimpses of the balance sheet carnage. The Trump Taj Mahal casino reported a $25. 5 million net loss during its first six months of 1990 the Trump’s Castle casino lost $43. 5 million for the year. His airline, Trump Shuttle, lost $34. 5 million during just the first six months of that year. “Simply put, the organization is in dire financial straits,” the casino regulators concluded. Reports by New Jersey’s casino regulators strongly suggested that Mr. Trump had claimed large net operating losses on his taxes in the early 1990s. Their reports, for example, revealed that Mr. Trump had carried forward net operating losses in both 1991 and 1993. What’s more, the reports said the losses he claimed were large enough to virtually cancel out any taxes he might owe on the millions of dollars of debt that was being forgiven by his creditors. (The I. R. S. considers forgiven debt to be taxable income.) But crucially, the casino regulators redacted the precise size of the net operating losses in the public versions of their reports. Two former New Jersey officials, who were privy to the unredacted documents, could not recall the precise size of the numbers, but said they were substantial. Politico, which previously reported that Mr. Trump most likely paid no income taxes in 1991 and 1993 based on the casino commission’s description of his net operating losses, asked Mr. Trump to comment. “Welcome to the real estate business,” he replied in an email. Now, thanks to Mr. Trump’s 1995 tax records, the degree to which he spun all those years of red ink into tax   gold may finally be apparent. Mr. Mitnick, the lawyer and accountant, was the person Mr. Trump leaned on most to do the spinning. Mr. Mitnick worked for a small Long Island accounting firm that specialized in handling tax issues for wealthy New York real estate families. He had long handled tax matters for Mr. Trump’s father, Fred C. Trump, and he said he began doing Donald Trump’s taxes after Mr. Trump turned 18. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mitnick said he could not divulge details of Mr. Trump’s finances without Mr. Trump’s consent. But he did talk about Mr. Trump’s approaches to taxes, and he contrasted Fred Trump’s attention to detail with what he described as Mr. Trump’s brash and undisciplined style. He recalled, for example, that when Donald and Ivana Trump came in each year to sign their tax forms, it was almost always Ivana who asked more questions. But if Mr. Trump lacked a sophisticated understanding of the tax code, and if he rarely showed any interest in the details behind various tax strategies, Mr. Mitnick said he clearly grasped the critical role taxes would play in helping him build wealth. “He knew we could use the tax code to protect him,” Mr. Mitnick said. According to Mr. Mitnick, Mr. Trump’s use of net operating losses was no different from that of his other wealthy clients. “This may have had a couple extra digits compared to someone else’s operation, but they all benefited in the same way,” he said, pointing to the $916 million loss on Mr. Trump’s tax returns. In “The Art of the Deal,” his 1987   book, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Mitnick as “my accountant”  —   although he misspelled his name. Mr. Trump described consulting with Mr. Mitnick on the tax implications of deals he was contemplating and seeking his advice on how new federal tax regulations might affect real estate  . Mr. Mitnick, though, said there were times when even he, for all his years helping wealthy New Yorkers navigate the tax code, found it difficult to face the incongruity of his work for Mr. Trump. He felt keenly aware that Mr. Trump was living a life of unimaginable luxury thanks in part to Mr. Mitnick’s ability to relieve him of the burden of paying taxes like everyone else. “Here the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,” he said.",0

"California considers tighter lobbying rules as 2016 election nears SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California’s elections watchdog on Thursday voted to force groups that hire lobbyists to reveal more about the hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually to sway state lawmakers on climate change, education and other issues. In 2015, spending on lobbyists in the most populous U.S. state topped $243 million - nearly as much as the payroll for all of California’s state lawmakers combined. “We want more disclosure of these payments to shine light on the interaction between public officials and the special interests attempting to influence them,” said Jodi Remke, chair of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, which adopted the rules in a unanimous 5-0 vote. California joins a handful of states considering tighter campaign finance and ethics laws in the run-up to the Nov. 8 elections, including Missouri, New York, New Mexico and South Carolina. The California rules would not apply to federal lawmakers, such as the state’s U.S. representatives. When the California rules go into effect July 1, organizations that hire lobbyists will have to specify whether payments over $2,500 are used for advertising, research, event planning or public affairs, among other categories. But critics say the proposal does not go far enough. The new rules do not, for example, require those who hire lobbyists to identify the legislation that an individual payment was intended to influence.  And critics say the public affairs category, which encompasses grassroots organizing and coalition building, could easily become a murky catch-all much as the “other” category is used currently. “If the idea is to improve disclosure, why create a new category that is just as vague?” asked Denise Roth Barber, managing director of the National Institute on Money in State Politics.  Lobbyists have been mostly quiet on the proposal.  As of Wednesday afternoon, only one firm had responded to the commission’s request for comment, saying the regulations would create too much paperwork and asking that the effective date be postponed until 2017. None of 2014’s top spenders on lobbying - among them the Western States Petroleum Association and California State Council of Service Employees - would comment for this story. Remke conceded the measures are incremental, blaming an outdated software system for limiting the number of new categories that can be added to California’s searchable campaign spending database. But Carmen Balber, the executive director of Santa Monica-based Consumer Watchdog, said the commission could still demand more details, uploading the disclosure forms as stand-alone images or offering copies to the public upon request.

"Mexico presidential race roiled as leftist front-runner embraces right wing party MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The front-runner in Mexico s 2018 election has embraced a small, socially conservative party in his bid for the presidency, sparking criticism among progressives that could splinter his support in what is expected to be a tight race. Earlier this week, two-time presidential runner-up Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador entered into a coalition with the Social Encounter Party (PES), a tiny party with religious roots that pushes an anti-gay and anti-abortion agenda. The coalition is led by Lopez Obrador s left-of-center MORENA party and also includes the socialist-leaning Labor Party. Lopez Obrador, who is leading in most polls, has been Mexico s best-known leftist since he served as mayor of the capital a decade ago. In previous elections he favored tie-ups with left-wing parties. Some political analysts said a coalition with social conservatives could provide Lopez Obrador with the margin he needs to prevail in a crowded field of candidates, including first-time independents. But cracks in his progressive base are emerging.  It looks like our rights will have to keep waiting,  said Lol Kin Castaneda, a leading gay rights activist who helped push Mexico City s approval of marriage equality in 2010. Mexico s Supreme Court ruled that gay marriage is lawful. Still, fewer than half of the country s 32 states have laws on the books that permit civil marriage for gays and lesbians, and individual same-sex couples in most states must fight to be recognized, often at great cost.  It s an error for MORENA to join forces with PES... In this alliance, PES wins,  Andres Lajous, a left-leaning writer and television pundit, posted on Twitter. Leo Zuckermann, a socially liberal commentator, suggested that Lopez Obrador, popularly known by his initials AMLO, is revealing his true colors by aligning himself with the PES.  People of the left, it s time to recognize that AMLO is a conservative on these issues,  he wrote in newspaper Excelsior. Lopez Obrador, like many Latin American leftists, has traditionally focused on fighting poverty and graft, not divisive social issues like gay rights or a woman s right to an abortion. In the past, he has said such issues are not  so important  compared to the fight against corruption. He has also proposed putting same-sex marriage and abortion to a popular vote, which rankles activists like Castaneda. Asked if she might still support Lopez Obrador, Castaneda was quick to answer.  Right now, I haven t made a decision.  ",0
"The Atlantic VP: ’Democratization’ of News via the Internet Left People ’Overwhelmed with Information’ - Breitbart Hayley Romer, the Senior Vice President at The Atlantic, spoke about the issue of fake news in a speech entitled “The Importance of Questioning Answers” at the Dublin Tech Summit this week. [“I’m not sure if this is something that was hardwired into me since birth,” Romer began, “or it’s something that I’ve grown overly accustomed to since joining The Atlantic five years ago, but regardless I definitely describe myself as somebody who relentlessly questions answers. And I think I do that for a couple of reasons. First of all, for me, it’s the only way to really make sense of things, but the other reason is because it’s the only way to get to the truth, right?”  “Thinking about coming here today, I felt like this notion of something that’s absolutely transcending our society in so many ways, and I thought this would be a great place to talk about how we got there and why we need to now, more than ever, be questioning our answers. ” Romer discussed the perils of only viewing information that validates your current worldview and the issues that arise when living in a bubble, whether it be related to politics, news, or social issues. “Let’s say for a second I understood what your political views were and I were to only send you things that validate that view, or I say, ‘I understand that you believe in this, I’m just gonna keep sending you things that validate your opinion.’ Is that a good thing? I’m not sure,” she said. “I think that assumption is one that sort of lies on the edge of something worth debating, hence the nature of this conversations. Let’s take a step back and look at the news. It used to be that every night in order to get the news, you had one trusted voice come into your home. You’d turn on your TV, you’d sit down at the end of the day, and somebody would show up and tell you everything that you needed to know, and you believed what they said. ” “Once cable news came around, you had choices, you had more ways to gain access to information, you didn’t necessarily have to listen to things so broadly, and you had the opportunity at that point through cable news to gain access to different opinions, different perspectives, different sets of news information, if you will,” she continued. “But then came the Internet where everyone had a voice, and the thing about the Internet was that it was going to be the total democratization of all humanity,” Romer stated. “We would create a global free open exchange of ideas. Everyone had access to everything, and this was going to be the ultimate dream because you no longer had to wait for someone to come into your home at a certain time of day. ” “But reality, as we know, is much more complicated than that,” she said. “Everyone flocked to the Internet a lot faster than we could have predicted, which left us saying, ‘What do we do now, how do we figure this out?’ Pretty soon we were overwhelmed with information of course. ” Romer discussed the competition between content providers to produce valuable content and attract a new and massively growing marketplace of users. This lead to a new industry of content and advertising, encouraging competition between websites to attract more users and deliver more ads, increasing revenue. The Internet, according to Romey, allowed content developers to understand what their audience wanted to hear and see and provide that to them, encouraging them to return to their website.  ",0
"Kentucky county to appeal federal ruling striking right-to-work law LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Officials for a Kentucky county will appeal a federal judge’s ruling that invalidated its right-to-work law, the county’s lawyer said on Thursday. The ruling came a year after labor organizations sued Hardin County after it passed an ordinance that prohibited unions from mandating its members pay dues in exchange for representation. So-called “right-to-work” laws allow employees at unionized employers to skip joining a union and avoid paying union dues. U.S. District Judge David Hale ruled on Wednesday evening that local regulation of union agreements is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. Hale’s order means that only states can implement such legislation. Democrats, who hold a majority in the state House of Representatives, have blocked repeated bills aiming to make Kentucky the 26th right-to-work state. “These illegal ordinances would have affected all working people, union and non-union, by decreasing wages, lowering median household incomes, increasing poverty and undermining workplace safety,” said Kentucky State AFL-CIO President Bill Londrigan. Beginning in late 2014, several Kentucky counties began passing their own laws after advocates claimed Kentucky law granted counties the same abilities as the state. Proponents of right-to-work laws say they can be a tool to attract new businesses. The ruling affects only Hardin County in north-central Kentucky, one of 12 to have passed a right-to-work law. Four others have passed a first reading. Jim Waters, president of the Bluegrass Institute, said about 80 of Kentucky’s 120 counties had considered passing a right-to-work law but were waiting for Hale’s decision. John Lovett, a lawyer representing Hardin County, said the case pits the interests of local communities against the nation’s most powerful labor unions. “Few issues are more ‘local’ than what a working person is free to do with his or her own money,” Lovett said.

"Macron calls for French food chain changes to help farmers PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron called for changes to France s food chain on Wednesday to ensure that farmers, who have been hit by squeezed margins and a retail price war, are paid fairly. Macron said he supported a new type of contract, based on farmers  production costs, which would require stronger producer organizations and a change in legislation. The changes are part of a wide field-to-fork review promised by Macron during his presidential campaign as he sought to appease farmers, an important constituency in French politics, who have also complained of excessive red tape. Last year a third of farmers earned less than 350 euros ($403) a month, the Agricultural Mutual Assistance Association (MSA) said, a third of the net minimum wage. Macron endorsed a proposal from the workshops to create a reversed contract starting from farmers, to food processors and to retailers. This would ensure a better spread of added value along the chain.  We should allow farmers not to rely on subsidies anymore and therefore ensure than they be paid a fair amount for their work,  Macron told farmers and food industry players at the Rungis food market near Paris. Prices are currently defined by buyers tempted to pressure prices, leaving many farmers unable to cover their costs. Answering a proposal by a majority of French retailers to raise the minimum prices they can charge on products, a move which they say could benefit those lower down the supply chain, Macron said he would limit it to food products and only favor if each sector proposes organization plans by year-end. Macron s office said on Tuesday he had delayed until the end of the year his decision on retailers  proposal as he sought guarantees it will meet his promise to boost farm income and food quality while minimizing retail inflation.  Raising the threshold of resale at a loss without asking for any effort, no accompaniment, no transformation, is a form of blank cheque,  he added.  Company and industry representatives, unions, non-governmental organizations and officials, gathered at the so-called Food Convention since the summer to discuss topics ranging from food quality to farm income and export strategy. A second phase will start next week with debates focusing on healthy, safe and sustainable food and will last until year-end. ($1 = 0.8449 euros) ",0
"Poll Finds Voters in Both Parties Unhappy With Their Candidates - The New York Times On the eve of the major party conventions, voters are grudgingly rallying around the nominees while expressing broad misgivings about the candidates, the campaign and the direction of the country, according to the latest New York   News Poll. More than a third of Republicans say they are disappointed or upset that Donald J. Trump, who crashed the party’s nominating process, will represent them in the fall campaign an equal number say he does not represent the values the party should stand for. Democrats are only marginally happier with Hillary Clinton as their party’s candidate. A quarter of Democratic voters say they are disappointed in her as the nominee an additional seven percent say they are upset. More promisingly for her,   say Mrs. Clinton stands for the core values and principles of the Democratic Party. The broad discontent is reflected in the    contest, which has Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton tied at 40 percent. Mr. Trump’s standing has held steady for weeks at around 40 percentage points, while Mrs. Clinton has polled in the   in most public surveys. The latest   News Poll was conducted after the F. B. I. rebuked her for her email practices but before Bernie Sanders, her persistent primary rival, embraced and endorsed her this week. So the dip in her standing could be temporary and reverse sharply if the Democrats, who are far more united as a party than the Republicans, pull off a successful convention in Philadelphia. In a development not seen in any modern presidential contest, more than half of all voters hold unfavorable views of the two major party candidates and large majorities say neither is honest and trustworthy. Only half of voters say Mrs. Clinton is prepared to be president, while an astonishing   say that Mr. Trump is not ready for the job  —   including four in 10 Republicans. Peter Lieb, 54, a middle school history teacher in West Palm Beach, Fla. voted for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio in the Florida primary and said in a   interview that he was only reluctantly planning to vote for Mr. Trump in November. Why Mr. Trump? “Honestly?” Mr. Lieb said. “Last man standing. ” “I am not a   supporter of Donald Trump, but given the alternatives that I’m presented with, he is the best person for the task at hand,” he said. “And the task at hand in my opinion is regaining economic stability and regaining America’s stature in the world. I don’t see Hillary Clinton doing a constructive job in either. ” The nationwide poll was conducted July   on cellphones and landlines among 1, 358 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all voters. Preconvention polls are often erratic, and political analysts and campaign managers put more stock in polls taken after both parties have formally nominated their candidates. And national polls, while useful as a gauge of broad sentiment, are less reliable than state polls in predicting the ultimate outcome. Mrs. Clinton enjoys strong advantages in many of the swing states she will need to secure victory in the Electoral College. Mrs. Clinton still leads in averages of recent polls, though her margin has narrowed since late June. The latest   News poll could be an indication of an even tighter race. Yet Mr. Trump has not led a national poll that meets The Times’s polling standards since   just after he won enough delegates to secure the Republican nomination. While the race may be narrow, the gloom appears broad. Rachel Woolard, 20, of Jacksonville, Fla. supported Mr. Sanders in the primary but now says she will, with misgivings, probably vote for Mrs. Clinton. “Bernie seemed to be more transparent than her,” said Ms. Woolard, a college student. “She definitely has the stereotypical politician approach to things, so that makes her feel a little disingenuous. ” Ms. Woolard is not yet fully committed to voting for Mrs. Clinton. But she knows whom she is voting against. “I know for a fact that I’m not voting for Trump. ” Laura Schrock, 36, a homemaker and political independent in Greenwood, Del. said she will not vote for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. “At this point, the plan is to vote for the Libertarian candidate,” she said, referring to Gary Johnson. “I highly value being real and being very honest. And I’m just not getting that from either one. ” In a   contest, Mr. Johnson has 12 percent, while Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are tied with 36 percent. Republicans and Democrats are divided by more than political philosophy and their choice of presidential candidates. They hold very different views of the state of the nation, the   News poll found. For example: ■ 86 percent of Trump supporters disapprove of the job President Obama is doing 90 percent of Clinton backers approve. ■ More than nine in 10 Trump supporters say the country is on the wrong track fewer than half of Clinton supporters agree. ■ About   of Trump supporters favor building a wall along the Mexican border only 13 percent of Clinton’s backers do so. ■ Four of five Trump supporters do not like the way the nation’s values are changing only about half as many Clinton supporters agree. Voters of all persuasions share one sentiment, however. Six in 10 Republicans, Democrats and independents say they are not looking forward to the next few months of the campaign.",0
"Germany may need constitutional change to allow it to strike back at hackers BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany may need to change its constitution to allow it to strike back at hackers who target private computer networks and it hopes to complete any legal reforms next year, a top Interior Ministry official said on Monday. The plan could include disarming servers used in attacks and reflects growing concern about the frequency and intensity of such attacks. Industry is also raising pressure on government to respond to the barrage, which ultimately could hurt Europe s leading economy. State Secretary Klaus Vitt told Reuters the government believed  significant legal changes would be needed  to allow such  hack back  actions.  A constitutional change may be needed since this is such a critical issue,  Vitt said on the sidelines of a cyber conference organized by the Handelsblatt newspaper.  The goal is to get it done by the end of next year at the latest.  Vitt said much would depend on the outcome of coalition talks in Germany of which cyber capabilities formed a part. Experts say it may be easier to enact the legal changes under a right-center-left coalition, which has ruled for the past four years, than under a three-way coalition with smaller parties that Chancellor Angela Merkel initially tried to forge. Top German intelligence officials told parliament last month they needed greater legal authority to strike back in the event of cyber attacks from foreign powers. Vitt told the conference that changing threats and new modes of attack required different responses from government agencies including more  offensive  capabilities.  We must assume that purely preventative measures will not be sufficient to counter future attacks,  Vitt said. He said no one would question the need for police to enter a house and disarm a sniper shooting at innocent people.  But what about servers that are used to launch cyber attacks that paralyze the IT (information technology) of hospitals or utilities, affecting hundreds of thousands of people?  Andreas Jambor, chief information security officer for RWE Generation SE, a unit of German energy giant RWE (RWEG.DE), welcomed the moves.  There s a war underway on the internet .... We want things to be sorted out,  Jambor said.  Other countries are doing it and we should do it here as well.  Andreas Ebert, head of security for German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said any offensive action should be taken by the government. Arne Schoenbohm, president of Germany s BSI federal cyber protection agency, declined to give details about the legal concepts being developed. He said the need to target servers would likely make up just  0.01 percent of all cases.  ",0
"To Understand Clinton’s Moment, Consider That It Came 32 Years After Ferraro’s - The New York Times The scenes blend like images from a kaleidoscope. A woman, blond, jubilant in a white dress, shown magnified on a convention center screen in San Francisco. It is Geraldine A. Ferraro in 1984 accepting the Democratic nomination that made her the first woman in the nation to be tapped by a major party to run for vice president. Turn the lens. A woman, blond, in a white tunic, smiling, arms thrown wide at a rally in Brooklyn this past week. It is Hillary Clinton claiming the Democratic nomination, the first woman to become the presidential   for a major party. There are those who now say that a woman running for president was inevitable, that the 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling that Mrs. Clinton talks about are just time moving on. There are the sighs that Mrs. Clinton is the wrong woman, the unexciting woman, the compromising woman. And there are those who say they could never vote for a Democrat, particularly this one. But it took 32 years to get from one scene to the other, so a look back to the Ferraro campaign can tell a lot about how the country has changed, and how it has not, through these decades of cultural ferment over the roles of the sexes. It may be hard to remember how few women there were in public life when Ms. Ferraro told cheering Democrats, “If we can do this, we can do anything. ” The Democrats had no female senators. (The Republicans had two.) There was only one female governor  —   Martha Layne Collins of Kentucky, a Democrat. Dianne Feinstein was still the mayor of San Francisco, yet to start her long Senate career. Representative Shirley Chisholm of New York, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination in 1972, had already retired. Women have since become the majority in college, and women in both parties have made a steady march forward in politics. Some are senators and governors and three have been secretary of state, all making the idea of a woman at the helm of the nation seem far less revolutionary. Ms. Ferraro was quizzed relentlessly about arms control and about whether she could even be credible as the commander in chief should she have to step up and be president. Could a woman be trusted with the nuclear button? But with her background as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton is not questioned about her toughness. Instead, the left asks whether she might be too quick to seek military intervention and the right critiques her judgment. She is the one now asking whether Donald J. Trump’s finger should be anywhere near the nuclear button. In other ways, things have changed less. As Mrs. Clinton, Sarah Palin and Carly Fiorina can attest, female candidates are still examined not only for competence, character and policy priorities, but for the way they look, the tone of their voice and the state of their marriages. For Ms. Ferraro it was the tangled financial dealings of her husband, John Zaccaro, his subsidy of her first congressional campaign, and her back and forth on whether she would release his tax returns, which she tried to brush off with the damaging quip, “You people who are married to Italian men, you know what it’s like. ” Now Mr. Trump promises to keep the Clinton marriage, and the former president’s infamous infidelities, in the spotlight. Mrs. Clinton time and again had to help save her husband’s candidacy and presidency, tarnishing her feminist credentials for some. (“I’m not sitting here  —   some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,” she said way back in 1992, when his run for president nearly foundered. “I’m sitting here because I love him, and I respect him, and I honor what he’s been through and what we’ve been through together. ”) And then there is the press corps. Politico recently wrote of the current crop of Clinton reporters, “No one can remember a political press corps this heavily female. ” I can. It was the Ferraro press corps, and I was part of it. I was dispatched to the campaign  —   like women from most major networks and publications  —   because editors sought women to capture the history of one of their own at a time when we were breaking into the ranks of the campaign press. Perhaps, we occasionally suspected, some of them also thought it would be beneath a man to ride that campaign plane. As a reporter for Newsday, I watched the euphoric, rapturous crowds, mostly women and girls who showed up with “To Gerry with Love” signs, even in the campaign’s last days, when it was going down to a decisive defeat to President Reagan and George Bush. Some campaign bands could make you wince, playing “Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue” or “Hello, Dolly!” There were the strange male missteps: the mayor of Los Angeles saying he wanted “a vice president I can hug,” the Mississippi official who called Ms. Ferraro “young lady” and asked whether she could bake a blueberry muffin. The grim drumbeat about her husband’s finances, his real estate dealings and his tax returns. There was the constant watch for weakness  —   would the woman cry? It is easy to forget those moments these days, when women in power don’t seem so unusual. If you have a long memory you have watched other women on the national stage, too. Representative Patricia Schroeder explored a Democratic race in 1987, after Gary Hart stood down. Senator Elizabeth Dole dropped out of the Republican presidential race in October 1999 before any of the primaries. Former Senator Carol Moseley Braun ran in the Democratic primaries in 2004. Governor Palin of Alaska became the first Republican woman nominated for the vice presidency in 2008  —   24 years after Ms. Ferraro. And we have been watching Mrs. Clinton for so long, through so many iterations, that it can feel like we know everything about her. But in the 1980s the quest to put a woman in the White House started as a cause without a candidate. It was driven by women’s groups and by the numbers. The notion of a gender gap was being talked about by both parties. Suddenly it was significant that more women than men registered to vote and that women seemed more likely to vote. The Equal Rights Amendment had collapsed, failing to win the required ratification of   of the states. Politically active women in the feminist movement, including Bella Abzug and Gloria Steinem, wrote a manifesto to the Democratic candidates for president in 1983 warning them to agree on an agenda for issues affecting women or face the possibility of women staying home on Election Day: “We will not hold still to be treated as an afterthought, a side issue, or a powerless constituency that can be betrayed without consequences. ” By 1984, they were fighting to get a woman on the ticket. When Walter F. Mondale selected Ms. Ferraro as his running mate, she was a   congresswoman from Queens. She came from New York, which had unexpectedly swung to Ronald Reagan in his 1980 landslide. Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill Jr. was a mentor and proponent. She was pretty, married, 48 years old and traditional enough that party leaders thought she could excite women but might not alienate male voters. “What is different,” says Ann Lewis, a longtime Democratic activist, “is that Hillary Clinton in the last   years has achieved national stature in ways that too few women have. Gerry Ferraro is nominated in 1984 and she is almost unknown. It isn’t until 1986 that Barbara Mikulski becomes the first Democratic woman who makes it to the Senate in her own right. ” The mood at that convention was electric. But the choreography around this first woman could also be tortured. How should Mr. Mondale and Ms. Ferraro share the stage? Could they touch? They shouldn’t hug. Who should hold her pocketbook when she spoke? “It sounds so strange now, but everything was being done for the first time,” Ms. Lewis said. “We had until then lots of images of women and men on stage together, but they were married. All the stage craft we had taken for granted had to be looked at very carefully. ” Madeleine K. Albright was Ms. Ferraro’s issues adviser, briefing the candidate on foreign policy and preparing her for her race against Mr. Bush, years before Ms. Albright became the nation’s first female secretary of state in the Clinton administration. She remembers some of the jarring juxtapositions of that candidacy. “There was the business about what she had on and what her hair looked like,” she recalls. “On the other side was her being asked questions about throw weights and nuclear capabilities that they weren’t asking Bush. ” On “Meet the Press,” Ms. Ferraro was once asked, “Do you think that in any way the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply because you are a woman?” By November, the disclosures about Ms. Ferraro’s husband’s businesses had damaged a campaign that was already an uphill battle. Though women and girls showed up at her rallies to the end, TV network polls showed that she may have cost the Democratic ticket more than she gained for it. Looking back, was the scrutiny of Ms. Ferraro, who died in 2011, fair game or driven by discomfort with the idea of a woman as vice president? Ms. Ferraro’s campaign manager, John Sasso, calls it some of both. “Experience matters,” he said, noting that because Mrs. Clinton has the deep résumé that Ms. Ferraro lacked, she will run and face a very different campaign. This time, of course, the first woman is at the top of the ticket, calling all the shots. “She’s been on the front lines of this process for a very long time,” said Lissa Muscatine, a friend and former speechwriter to Mrs. Clinton. “She’s been the vessel for lots of women’s hopes on the one hand, but also has had to take the brunt from people who aren’t ready for it. ” Mrs. Clinton’s detractors look dimly on appeals to support her as a pathbreaker. “I’m not a huge fan of identity politics and this is sort of the apotheosis of identity politics,” said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “Basically, to me Hillary Clinton is saying: ‘I wasn’t good enough to get here on my own. Forget that people voted for me on the merits, they voted for me because I was a woman.’ How demeaning is that?” On Friday, Ms. Fiorina, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination this year, told a crowd, “Hillary Clinton, news flash. I’m a feminist and I’m not voting for you. ” Maybe Hillary Clinton is right  —   that she has become our national Rorschach test. Do you admire her perseverance? Dislike her compromises? Seek more passion? Question her honesty? Ponder her marriage? Love her policies? Hate her policies? Debate whether she is a feminist? Debate whether it matters? For one night last week, it was hard to deny her words that “tonight caps an amazing journey  —   a long, long journey. ”",0
"5 Key Takeaways From President Trump’s Speech - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   In President Trump’s world, boring is disruptive. After   weeks of gleefully setting the Washington establishment ablaze and declaring a new war with virtually every public utterance, Mr. Trump took the radical step on Tuesday night of delivering a soothing comfort food of an address to a jittery Congress and skeptical public. For the first time since his   in January, Mr. Trump seemed to accept the fetters of formality and tradition that define and dignify the presidency. And while he touched on all of the   elements of the economic nationalist agenda that has impelled his executive orders and calls for “revolution,” Mr. Trump brandished a blunter rhetorical ax and, for once, delivered on his promise to speak the Reagan Republican dialect of optimism and reconciliation. Why the sudden shift? Numbers. Mr. Trump’s approval rating is the worst for any new president in recorded history  —   between 38 and 50 percent at a time when many presidents are in the 60s. Slamming the news media or   demonstrators energizes his base, but it’s hard to move much higher in the polls without making a less partisan pitch. The other key statistic spurring his    adjustment: $54 billion, the amount of federal funding he hopes to siphon from other departments to increase spending at the Pentagon  —   a budget proposal that is already   on arrival, judging from its lukewarm reception on Capitol Hill this week. Presidents, even those commanding comfortable majorities in both houses, need to get Congress in line, and the only way to do that is to declare peace. Here are five takeaways from the most presidential speech Mr. Trump has ever given  —   delivered at precisely the moment he needed to project sobriety, seriousness of purpose and  . The   between Tuesday’s temperate Mr. Trump and the everyday Mr. Trump was striking, to put it mildly. “The time for trivial fights is over,” said Mr. Trump, a man who spent the first 48 hours of his presidency bickering about the size of the inauguration crowd. While that statement was meant as a challenge to his establishment critics, it also seemed as if he were coaching himself. All of the previous   speeches delivered by Mr. Trump, from his nomination address in Cleveland last summer to his   inaugural speech, had a gloomy,    quality. His aides promised a Ronald   invocation of America’s future in the days leading up to his  . What he delivered, thanks to his speechwriting team of Stephen Miller and Stephen K. Bannon, was an invocation of “American carnage. ” Since his   Mr. Trump roved the airwaves and Twitter, lashing out at anyone who opposed him, and many people who didn’t. In just the past couple of weeks, the president has reiterated his description of some news outlets as “enemies of the American people,” while taking his shots at Paris, Sweden, Hill Democrats, the F. B. I. government leakers, President Barack Obama and his own communications staff, among other targets. But on Tuesday, the president rolled the dice, and went for nice. In style, if not substance, Mr. Trump delivered an address that nearly any of his Republican primary opponents  —   whom he once savaged as establishment stooges  —   might have delivered had they been standing at the rostrum. “That torch is now in our hands,” Mr. Trump said within the first few minutes of his speech, echoing, if not entirely approaching, the wispy mountaintop oratory of more polished predecessors like Mr. Obama and Mr. Reagan. “And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. ” Mr. Trump has made immense progress sticking to a script, but Wednesday is a new day, and the presidential Twitter finger gets itchy in the middle of the week. The big question is whether his unifying tone represents the mythical,   pivot point  —   or was just part of a   speech efficiently delivered by a gifted politician learning his new trade. Mr. Trump has been criticized for his sluggish response to violence and vandalism against Jews, blacks and Muslims during his presidency. But the opening words of his speech were dedicated to tolerance and inclusion. “Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City,” he said, “remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. ” Again, it’s hard to say if his statement reflected a genuine change of approach. Mr. Trump and some allies have suggested that recent   episodes might be   attempts by his opponents to embarrass him. But his words were welcomed in the House chamber, greeted by some of the most sustained applause of the evening. The polls have not been especially kind to Mr. Trump lately, but there is one distinct bright spot: 56 percent of voters in a   Consult poll released on Tuesday said that Mr. Trump was following through on his campaign promises. This is no small matter for a president eager to prove he’s no mere talker. For all its messaging, personnel and operational struggles, Mr. Trump’s team has relentlessly executed a branding strategy aimed at projecting the image of a man of action fighting against gridlocked and corrupt Washington elites. Every day, Mr. Trump appears before the cameras where he is shown doing stuff like signing executive orders or convening panels of business, labor or political leaders. “It’s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I’ve made in keeping those promises,” he said, taking an extended bow for saving jobs at several factories across the country, renegotiating defense contracts, scrapping the   Partnership, greenlighting two new fuel pipelines and cracking down on illegal immigration and criminal foreigners. Never mind that Mr. Obama, the man Mr. Trump says left him “a mess” to clean up, had accomplished much more at this point in his term  —   including the stimulus package and a gender   law. For all his newfound civility and message discipline, Mr. Trump cares most about this takeaway  —   proving he is an effective president at a time when his administration is being portrayed in the media as   adrift and  . The president’s speech had admirable length (it clocked in at just over 60 minutes) the requisite number of ovations, about 90, and a succession of punchy pronouncements. What it didn’t have was very much of an explanation on how Mr. Trump plans to govern. There were hardly any details about his proposals on the   items that will most likely define his first term. That included his Obamacare    pledge, his plan to overhaul the tax code, the big infrastructure package he’s vowed to ram through, or even his plan to shovel $54 billion into the Defense Department. Cracking down on illegal immigration is the central pillar of Mr. Trump’s   popularity with white   voters, so much so that it was the subject of his most decisive action thus far as president: the bungled rollout of his executive order barring migrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations. But Mr. Trump and his team sent out some seriously mixed messages in the hours leading up to the address. “We will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border,” Mr. Trump declared, to the delight of many Republicans in the hall, who gave him a hearty standing ovation. But earlier, in a   with some of the country’s leading news anchors, the president seemed to soften his stance considerably, as he has done previously in private, suggesting that legal status be granted to millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed serious crimes. Immigration   led by his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have long considered such a stance “amnesty. ” Mr. Trump never brought up the topic again  —   and didn’t touch on his prior reference to legalizing undocumented immigrants  —   raising questions about what position he’ll stake out in negotiations with Congress.",0
"On ‘Brexit,’ It’s Divorce First, Trade Talks Later, E.U. Tells U.K. - The New York Times BRUSSELS  —   Britain must agree to pay its bills and to protect millions of Europeans living in Britain before reaching a new trading relationship with the European Union, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Friday.    divorce and trade talks “will not happen,” Mr. Tusk said at a news conference in Malta. Divorce has to come first, he said, and he warned that the negotiations could be “confrontational. ” Mr. Tusk also wrote on Twitter: “Our duty is to minimize uncertainty, disruption caused by Brexit for citizens, businesses  Member States. It’s about damage control. ” He added that the European Union would not pursue a “punitive approach,” because “Brexit in itself is already punitive enough. ” He also wrote: “After more than 40 years of being united, we owe it to each other to make this divorce as smooth as possible. ” The words were tough, but unsurprising: For months, since Britain voted in a June 23 referendum to leave the bloc, Brussels has insisted that the terms of a future trade agreement would not be negotiated until the terms of the divorce were clear. Britain formally began the withdrawal process on Wednesday, and Mr. Tusk’s statement on Friday essentially made official the European Union’s stance. That was in keeping with the tough talk coming from Germany, the bloc’s most influential member, this week. On Friday, the finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, told a newspaper in the country that, while both sides should strive to minimize the damage, “there are no rights without obligations” and that Britain would have to leave the single market if it refused to abide by the European Union’s principles. That followed a statement on Thursday by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany that rejected a demand put forth by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain that talks on the withdrawal be conducted in tandem with discussions about economic relations. “The negotiations must first clarify how we will disentangle our interlinked relationship,” Ms. Merkel said. “Only when this question is dealt with can we  —   hopefully, soon after  —   begin talking about our future relationship. ” In laying out the European Union’s terms for the exit negotiations  —   which still must be approved by leaders of the 27 remaining nations  —   Mr. Tusk essentially presented the bloc’s response to Mrs. May’s opening move. Mr. Tusk said the 27 leaders would determine when there had been “sufficient progress” to start discussing Britain’s future trade arrangements. The terms, nonetheless, represent an early setback for Britain. The draft guidelines outline a “phased approach” that the European Union will require Britain to follow before talks about any deal on access to the European single market of more than 500 million consumers. The terms also signaled how Britain was losing control over developments in Europe by giving Spain an effective veto over whether any deal applied to Gibraltar, the rocky outcrop that has long been the subject of an acrimonious sovereignty dispute between London and Madrid. Spain had pressed to insert language on Gibraltar into the guidelines and succeeded because Britain did not have a say in the drafting, European Union officials said. Market access is a British priority that took on added urgency this week, as Mrs. May’s formal notification on Wednesday started a   clock to reach an agreement. That time constraint limits British leverage in the negotiations because it would face a welter of tariffs and customs barriers if a deal is not struck during that period. The guidelines will come into effect if national leaders approve them at a summit meeting on April 29. Michel Barnier, a former foreign minister of France, is then expected to take over    negotiations with the government in London. Mr. Barnier has said that he wants to wrap up talks by October 2018 to enable the European Parliament and member states to assess the results and allow terms for a transition to be agreed on. Although there is legal scope to extend the talks beyond March 2019, when the   statutory period expires, such a step would need unanimous approval from the 27 remaining countries. Ms. Merkel and President François Hollande of France have insisted that London first agree on how to protect the rights of more than about three million expatriates in Britain, and more than one million British citizens living in Continental Europe, and on the amount of money Britain owes to cover its commitments as a member of the bloc. European officials underlined the need to safeguard the rights of expatriates by referring to them in the opening paragraphs of the   guidelines. The document also said there should be a “single financial settlement” of Britain’s commitments but did not give a figure. The leaving bill could be roughly 60 billion euros, or $64 billion, according to the European Union authorities, and that sum is already a major sticking point. David Davis, the minister who leads Britain’s Department for Exiting the European Union, told British television on Thursday that he was not expecting a bill “anything like that” size. Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland has called for steps to preserve a peaceful coexistence with Northern Ireland, where there will be a new land border with the European Union. European officials said “flexible and imaginative solutions will be required” to maintain peace and avoid “a hard border” between Ireland, a European Union member, and Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom. Britain is the first country to leave the bloc. The procedure for the separation, known as Article 50, has never before been used. Striking a deal will be fiendishly complex, and there are hazards for both sides. European leaders do not want Britain to enjoy the same benefits that it has as a member of the bloc, such as unfettered access to the vast European Union single market. Yet they are extremely wary of Britain turning itself into a   haven with weakened regulations that would undercut European neighbors. Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, a member state that has some of the closest economic ties with Britain, said that “securing a fair and level playing field is the main objective. ” Another challenge for European leaders is to maintain unity. Populist politicians have bolstered their following by blaming the European Union for high unemployment in countries like Greece and for failing to prevent an influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa. France holds the first round of presidential elections in late April. Marine Le Pen, the   Union leader of the   National Front, has called for a referendum on leaving the bloc. For now, Emmanuel Macron, who is   is leading the polls. The European Parliament also has a final say over any deal reached with Britain. Lawmakers could veto any agreement that they find too generous or that they view as failing to guarantee the rights of citizens of European Union countries already in Britain to continue living and working there. “One thing is clear for us,” Manfred Weber, a German who is a powerful conservative lawmaker at the European Parliament, said this week. “Cherry picking is over for the United Kingdom, and we will defend the interests of the 440 million E. U. citizens when negotiating with the U. K. ”",0

"Indian court acquits dentist couple of killing daughter NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Thursday overturned the conviction of a dentist couple for the murder of their teenage daughter and the family servant for lack of material evidence, their lawyer said. Aarushi Talwar was found with her throat slit at the family home in the Delhi suburb of Noida in 2008. A day later, the body of the servant, Hemraj, was found on the roof of the house. A trial court convicted the girl s parents, Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, after police alleged Rajesh had murdered his daughter and the servant in a rage when he found them in a compromising situation. The couple, both dentists, were jailed for life. But a high court overruled the decision saying it was not satisfied with the evidence and ordered the couple be freed, their lawyer Tanveer Ahmed Mir said.  The court found no forensic or material evidence to prove that the Talwars had killed their daughter,  Mir told reporters outside a packed courtroom in the northern city of Allahabad. Both parents had denied the murder and insisted they were victims of botched investigations and unfair media coverage, damaging their defense. Aarushi s case was labeled as a kind of crime more often associated with rural, conservative parts of India where  honor killings  are not uncommon. Every twist in the investigation was extensively reported by the Indian press, turning the Talwars into household names.  Finally my family can lead a dignified life. The court has upheld the facts and truth,  said Rajesh Talwar s sister, Vandana, after the decision. In 2015, a journalist who covered the murder wrote a book arguing that the couple were innocent. The double murder case and faulty probe were used as a theme for a Bollywood movie the same year.   ",0
"Pennsylvania Republican Pushing Ban on Private Gun Sales - Breitbart Pennsylvania State Rep. Jamie Santora ( ) is pushing a ban on private gun sales nearly identical to the ones Michael   Moms Demand Action pushed in Washington state, Maine, and Nevada. [Santora’s bill would bar the private sales that Americans have enjoyed since the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791 and would require that every sale be processed in front of an agent of the government via a background check.  This means that   Pennsylvanians selling a gun to a fellow hunter, lifelong   or childhood friend would have to seek out a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder and the   buyer would have to pass a background check just as the Orlando Pulse attacker (June 12, 2016) the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012) Gabby Giffords’ attacker (January 8, 2011) the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009) and the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007) did. According to the Delaware County News Network, Santora says his attempt to expand the frequency of background checks is “common sense. ” He said, “We’re not trying to take away Second Amendment rights. Anyone who has a gun should have a background check. ” It should be noted that the following individuals all submitted to background checks in order to acquire their guns: The two   of Santora’s gun control bill are Democrats.

"Free Care a ‘Blessing’ for Victims of Orlando Nightclub Attack - The New York Times Rodney Sumter had three gunshot wounds, including one that seemed to be “a hole the size of a baseball. ” But during the 16 days he was in a Florida hospital, and in the weeks after a gunman opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, he never worried about the cost of healing his   body. He had insurance, as well as a hunch: Some manner of charity care was probably in the offing. His intuition was proved correct this month when Florida Hospital and Orlando Regional Medical Center said they would not bill victims of the June 12 siege, which left 49 people and the gunman, Omar Mateen, dead. “It’s definitely a blessing for everybody involved,” said Mr. Sumter, 27, who was working as a bartender at the gay nightclub. “You know, we’ve been through a lot. ” The hospitals said the donated aid, including emergency care and   surgery, could be worth more than $5. 5 million. The hospitals treated more than 50 people, some of whom died from their injuries. “It was incredible to see how our community came together in the wake of the senseless Pulse shooting,” Daryl Tol, the president and chief executive of Florida Hospital, said in a statement. “We hope this gesture can add to the heart and good will that defines Orlando. ” Next month, the OneOrlando Fund, which raised at least $23 million, is scheduled to begin issuing payments to victims of the shooting, during which Mr. Mateen pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State. Those disbursements, fund officials have said, have “no strings or obligations attached” and are intended to “serve as a gift to the victims of the Pulse tragedy. ” But medical bills have long been a leading concern in Orlando, where many victims suffered multiple gunshot wounds. Still, Mr. Sumter, who was also grazed by a fourth bullet, said officials had never discussed financial issues during his hospitalization. “It really wasn’t on my mind heavy, too heavy, because the doctors and the nurses, they were all really supportive,” said Mr. Sumter, who participates in physical therapy three times a week. Hospital officials, he said, “never really told me the estimated amount” associated with his medical care. Orlando Health, which operates Orlando Regional Medical Center, where Mr. Sumter was treated, said it had “not sent any hospital or medical bills directly to Pulse patients, and we don’t intend to pursue reimbursement of medical costs from them. ” The health system said that it would seek funding from other sources, including insurers and the state’s crime victim compensation program, but that its unrecovered costs could exceed $5 million. “The Pulse shooting was a horrendous tragedy for the victims, their families and our entire community,” David Strong, Orlando Health’s president and chief executive, said in a statement. “During this very trying time, many organizations, individuals and charities have reached out to Orlando Health to show their support. This is simply our way of paying that kindness forward. ” But Orlando Health, which runs the area’s premier trauma center, acknowledged that some Pulse patients might require continuing care, a poignant reality that corresponds with mounting concerns that the flow of donations might be insufficient when perhaps tens of millions of dollars are needed for disability services and lost wages. “We can’t predict the future needs of these patients, their financial situations, or what the state or federal governments may require us to do for charity policies,” the hospital said. “So, while we can’t assume the answer is free care forever, we will use our very generous charity and financial assistance policies to assess the best way to ensure our patients get quality care here at Orlando Health in the most fiscally responsible manner. ” Mr. Sumter, for one, said he was grateful for the donations by the hospitals, as well as the forthcoming money from the OneOrlando fund, which officials promised to victims soon after the attack. “You hear that often, but you don’t know what exactly everything is going to happen when the smoke clears,” he said. “It’s just good to know that not only are we receiving a nice fund, we don’t have to worry about the hospital bills. ”",0

"Trump unyielding on Hispanic judge uproar WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday rejected a barrage of criticism from his own party over his allegations of bias against a Hispanic judge, insisting his concerns were valid. “All I want to do is figure out why I’m being treated unfairly by a judge. And a lot of people agree with it,” Trump said on Fox News. Trump has been on the defensive since his comments last week about Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against Trump University, the New York businessman’s defunct real estate school. He has also been castigated by Democrats, including the party’s likely presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. “I don’t know what else you could call these attacks other than racist, other than prejudiced, other than bigoted,” Clinton said in an interview with MSNBC on Monday. “It’s just plain wrong, and certainly wrong coming from someone who is vying to become President of the United States.” Trump told campaign supporters in a conference call they should stand by him in his attacks on the judge, Bloomberg Politics reported. It said during the call Trump distanced himself from a memo his campaign sent supporters on Sunday that urged them to avoid the issue. Asked for comment, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: “It was a very positive call to discuss overall messaging.” Two Trump supporters, Tana Goertz and Scottie Nell Hughes, told CNN that former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer had said on the call that she wanted the campaign to go on the offense against expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Goertz said Trump told his suppporters not to be afraid to “call out the media” when TV reporters suggest that Trump is racist.  Trump has suggested that Curiel’s heritage is influencing the judge’s opinion about the case because of Trump’s campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, has pledged to seal the U.S.-Mexico border with a wall, and has said Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States. Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, joined the chorus of criticism. In an interview with Orlando’s WFTV, Rubio called Trump’s comments wrong and said he had to stop. “I ran for president and I warned this was going to happen,” Rubio said. Trump has regularly stirred up controversy on the campaign trail and has frequently dismayed Republican establishment leaders. His view of an ethnically biased judiciary has drawn a fresh wave of criticism, including concern in his own party. On Sunday he was asked if - by the same token - he believed a Muslim judge would be biased against him based on Trump’s call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. “It’s possible. Yes,” Trump said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Republican leaders including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have distanced themselves from Trump’s comments, saying they are worried the tone of his presidential campaign could enrage Latinos, who are a growing U.S. voting bloc. “If this doesn’t change we’re in for big trouble,” Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, said on MSNBC on Monday. “I hope to be able to support the nominee. I certainly can’t now,” said Flake, whose state has a large percentage of Hispanics. A former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ohio Governor John Kasich, called on Trump to apologize to Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents.  “Attacking judges based on their race (and/or) religion is another tactic that divides our country,” Kasich wrote on Twitter. “More importantly, it is flat out wrong.” It was unclear what, if any, effect the latest furor would have on Trump’s unorthodox candidacy. States with significant Hispanic populations including California, New Mexico and New Jersey hold nominating contests on Tuesday. Trump fought back against his Republican critics on Monday, with especially sharp words for Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker. Gingrich, mentioned as a possible running mate to Trump, on Sunday called Trump’s comments inexcusable. “I was surprised at Newt,” Trump told the “Fox & Friends” program. “I thought it was inappropriate what he said.” ",0

"Exclusive: Trump says 'major, major' conflict with North Korea possible, but seeks diplomacy  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday a major conflict with North Korea is possible in the standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, but he would prefer a diplomatic outcome to the dispute.  “There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely,” Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview ahead of his 100th day in office on Saturday.  Nonetheless, Trump said he wanted to peacefully resolve a crisis that has bedeviled multiple U.S. presidents, a path that he and his administration are emphasizing by preparing a variety of new economic sanctions while not taking the military option off the table.  “We’d love to solve things diplomatically but it’s very difficult,” he said.  REUTERS RECOMMENDS Racism on the rise: Reuters poll How North Korea gets its oil from China In other highlights of the 42-minute interview, Trump was cool to speaking again with Taiwan’s president after an earlier telephone call with her angered China.  He also said he wants South Korea to pay the cost of the U.S. THAAD anti-missile defense system, which he estimated at $1 billion, and intends to renegotiate or terminate a U.S. free trade pact with South Korea because of a deep trade deficit with Seoul.  Asked when he would announce his intention to renegotiate the pact, Trump said: “Very soon. I’m announcing it now.”  Trump also said he was considering adding stops to Israel and Saudi Arabia to a Europe trip next month, emphasizing that he wanted to see an Israeli-Palestinian peace. He complained that Saudi Arabia was not paying its fair share for U.S. defense.  Asked about the fight against Islamic State, Trump said the militant group had to be defeated.  “I have to say, there is an end. And it has to be humiliation,” he said, when asked about what the endgame was for defeating Islamist violent extremism.  Trump said North Korea was his biggest global challenge. He lavished praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping for Chinese assistance in trying to rein in Pyongyang. The two leaders met in Florida earlier this month.  “I believe he is trying very hard. He certainly doesn’t want to see turmoil and death. He doesn’t want to see it. He is a good man. He is a very good man and I got to know him very well.  “With that being said, he loves China and he loves the people of China. I know he would like to be able to do something, perhaps it’s possible that he can’t,” Trump said.  Trump spoke just a day after he and his top national security advisers briefed U.S. lawmakers on the North Korean threat and one day before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will press the United Nations Security Council on sanctions to further isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.  The Trump administration on Wednesday declared North Korea “an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority.” It said it was focusing on economic and diplomatic pressure, including Chinese cooperation in containing its defiant neighbor and ally, and remained open to negotiations.  U.S. officials said military strikes remained an option but played down the prospect, though the administration has sent an aircraft carrier and a nuclear-powered submarine to the region in a show of force.  Any direct U.S. military action would run the risk of massive North Korean retaliation and huge casualties in Japan and South Korea and among U.S. forces in both countries.  Trump, asked if he considered North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to be rational, said he was operating from the assumption that he is rational. He noted that Kim had taken over his country at an early age.  “He’s 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want but that is not easy, especially at that age.  “I’m not giving him credit or not giving him credit, I’m just saying that’s a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he’s rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he’s rational,” he said.  Trump, sipping a Coke delivered by an aide after the president ordered it by pressing a button on his desk, rebuffed an overture from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who told Reuters a direct phone call with Trump could take place again after their first conversation in early December angered Beijing.  China considers neighboring Taiwan to be a renegade province.  “My problem is that I have established a very good personal relationship with President Xi,” said Trump. “I really feel that he is doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation. So I wouldn’t want to be causing difficulty right now for him.  “So I would certainly want to speak to him first.”  Trump also said he hoped to avoid a potential government shutdown amid a dispute between congressional Republicans and Democrats over a spending deal with a Saturday deadline looming.  But he said if a shutdown takes place, it will be the Democrats’ fault for trying to add money to the legislation to “bail out Puerto Rico” and other items.  He also defended the one-page tax plan he unveiled on Wednesday from criticism that it would increase the U.S. deficit, saying better trade deals and economic growth would offset the costs.  “We will do trade deals that are going to make up for a tremendous amount of the deficit. We are going to be doing trade deals that are going to be much better trade deals,” Trump said.  ",0
"Trump steps up attacks with 'bimbo' tweet before Fox News debate WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday escalated a fight with Fox News, using the word “bimbo” in a derogatory tweet about anchorwoman Megyn Kelly after pulling out of a debate only days before the first nominating contest of the 2016 campaign. Trump on Tuesday withdrew from the televised encounter, scheduled for Thursday night in Des Moines, Iowa, in irritation at host Fox News (FOXA.O) for allowing Kelly to moderate after her questioning angered him in a debate last year.     The real estate magnate, who is the Republican front-runner to win the nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, followed up with another round of insults on Wednesday. “I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct,” he wrote on Twitter. “Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!” In a later interview on Fox News’s “The O’Reilly Factor,” he told host Bill O’Reilly that she was “highly overrated.” “I have zero respect for Megyn Kelly. I don’t think she’s very good at what she does,” Trump said. Trump’s Republican presidential rivals were quick to criticize the former reality TV star, with U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blistering him in a series of tweets and accusing him of “trembling at being questioned by Kelly.” At an event in West Des Moines, Iowa, Cruz openly mocked Trump, calling him a “fragile soul” and “gentle,” and renewed his offer to debate Trump one-on-one Saturday evening. “It’s not that he’s afraid of me,” Cruz said to the crowd. “He’s afraid of you. He doesn’t want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa about how his record doesn’t match what he’s selling.” Another Republican hopeful, U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, told Fox News that he welcomed Trump’s absence from the debate stage because it means “we don’t have to put up with a lot of empty blather and boastfulness and calling people names.” Trump’s decision means the last televised debate before Monday’s Iowa caucuses - which kick off the state-by-state nominating race to choose candidates for the presidential election - will not feature the man who has dominated the Republican race for months and leads many opinion polls. It was seen as a bold gamble. Trump has said that in lieu of his debate participation he will hold a fundraiser for veterans. It will be held at Drake University in Des Moines and begin at the same time Thursday as the Fox debate, according to an invitation his campaign circulated Wednesday evening.  “It’s a risky move; it’s very high profile,” said Craig Robinson, a former Iowa state party official. “But I’m not sure  it will really change anyone’s mind about Trump.”        Trump has been feuding with Fox News since the network hosted the first Republican debate in August, in which Kelly asked Trump about his treatment of women, prompting a stream of insults from the candidate and complaints he was not being treated fairly. He did not renew his attacks on Kelly during an evening rally in Gilbert, South Carolina, but told supporters to watch a rerun of the Fox interview, which he called a “tough interview,” when they got home. Cruz, Trump’s main rival in Iowa, used the hashtag #DuckingDonald to make fun of Trump for ducking out of the debate and tweeted a mocked-up picture of Trump’s head on Scrooge McDuck’s body sitting on a pile of money. Cruz, a conservative and a debating champion in college, tweeted a link to “duckingdonald.com,” which asked visitors to sign a petition in favor of Cruz and Trump having a side debate. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, another Republican presidential contender, described Trump’s decision at such a crucial time as “a big mistake” that calls into question his ability to be president. “Anytime you get a podium and a microphone and 15-20 million people watching in an election campaign, you should take it,” Christie told Boston Herald Radio. Another Republican candidate, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, said he wanted to focus on keeping the party united in order to beat Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, if she becomes the Democratic nominee. “These kinds of theatrics by Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are an entertaining sideshow, but they have nothing to do with defeating Hillary Clinton,” Rubio said. Not every candidate was convinced Trump would follow through on his pledge to stay away. “He apparently is not going to come to the debate, although I’ve got a $20 bet he’ll show up,” former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said at a town hall meeting in response to a question. “Poor little Donald, being treated unfairly,” he said. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said Trump was not afraid to debate his rivals or take reporters’ questions. He added that Trump would be happy to debate Cruz if the contest, in which 12 Republicans are vying for their party’s nomination, narrows.  “If it comes down to a two-person race, Donald Trump would be happy to debate him,” Lewandowski told ABC’s “Good Morning America” program. Fox News, in a statement on Tuesday, said it would not “give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees,” but left the door open to Trump attending the debate. The event will be co-hosted by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.              “At the end of the day, Mr. Trump is going to have the last laugh,” Lewandowski told MSNBC.

"Exclusive: Cambodia says opposition party could be barred from election PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s government has raised the possibility that the main opposition party could be ruled out of elections if it does not replace its leader, Kem Sokha, who has been charged with treason. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) has said it will not replace its leader and the comments reinforced its fears that Prime Minister Hun Sen plans to cripple it before next year s elections. The arrest of Kem Sokha on Sunday drew Western condemnation and marked an escalation in a crackdown on critics of Hun Sen, who has ruled for 30 years and could face possibly his toughest electoral challenge from the CNRP next year.  They have to appoint an acting president,  government spokesman Phay Siphan told Reuters on Tuesday.  If they don t comply with the law, they will not exist and have no right to political activity... It s their choice, not my choice.  Kem Sokha s daughter, Kem Monovithya, who is also a party official, said the party would not appoint a new leader. Kem Sokha was only named in February after his predecessor resigned in fear the party would be banned if he stayed on.  The ruling party can drop their divide-and-conquer plan now,  she said. Opposition officials accuse Hun Sen of trying to weaken or destroy the party ahead of the election, after it did well in June local elections, in which it nonetheless came well behind Hun Sen s Cambodia People s Party. Hun Sen, one of Asia s longest serving rulers, said on Wednesday there could be more arrests after  the act of treason  and it had reinforced the need for him to stay in office.  I ve decided to continue my work - not less than 10 years more,  he told garment factory workers, jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis. Kem Sokha became leader after opposition veteran Sam Rainsy resigned because of a new law that forbids any party having a leader who is found guilty of a crime. Sam Rainsy fled into exile to avoid a defamation conviction he says was political. Cambodian law says a political party has 90 days to replace a president if he or she dies, resigns or is convicted of an offence. Western countries have condemned the arrest of Kem Sokha and a crackdown on critics of Hun Sen, including independent media.  We don t care about people outside,  Phay Siphan said.  We care about our national security. We don t belong to anyone.  China, Hun Sen s close ally, has voiced support for Cambodia on steps to ensure its security. Kem Sokha was formally charged with treason on Tuesday. His lawyers have dismissed the evidence presented against him so far - a video publicly available since 2013 - in which he tells supporters he is getting support and advice from Americans for the campaign to win elections.      The government and the ruling CPP have manufactured these treason charges against Kem Sokha for political purposes, aiming to try and knock the political opposition out of the ring before the 2018 electoral contest even begins,  said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch.

"The Johnson Amendment, Which Trump Vows to ‘Destroy,’ Explained - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   When President Trump told an audience of religious leaders on Thursday that he would ‘destroy’ the Johnson Amendment, he declared his intention to sign a bill that would fundamentally alter a major aspect of the   divide that has been a constant in American politics for generations. But what exactly is the Johnson Amendment? It is one of the brightest lines in the legal separation between religion and politics. Under the provision, which was made in 1954,   entities like churches and charitable organizations are unable to directly or indirectly participate in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate. Specifically, ministers are restricted from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit. If they do, they risk losing their   status. Considered uncontroversial at the time, it was passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. Today, however, many Republicans want to repeal it. Back when Lyndon B. Johnson was a senator from Texas, he introduced the measure as an amendment to the tax code in 1954. Like many things Johnson did, the goal was to bludgeon a political opponent, in this case a rival in a primary who had the backing of nonprofit groups that were campaigning against him by suggesting he was a communist. Though there was no church involved, according to PolitiFact, churches were covered by the bill as well. Mr. Trump promised he would work to repeal the Johnson Amendment as part of his extensive outreach efforts to religious conservatives, a group that took a long time to warm to his candidacy. Eliminating the measure has been a goal of the right. Conservatives have argued that it violates the protections of free speech and free exercise that the First Amendment extends to houses of worship. Courts have not agreed. Speaking of the implications of a repeal last year, Jerry Falwell Jr. the prominent evangelical leader and Trump supporter, said it would “create a huge revolution for conservative Christians and for free speech. ”",0
"Lionel Shriver’s Address on Cultural Appropriation Roils a Writers Festival - The New York Times BRISBANE, Australia  —   Officials in charge of an Australian writers festival were so upset with the address by their keynote speaker, the American novelist Lionel Shriver, that they publicly disavowed her remarks. Links to her appearance were also temporarily unavailable on the festival website, leading supporters of Ms. Shriver to complain of censorship, but festival officials said it was only a technical malfunction on their website, which was repaired later. The event, the Brisbane Writers Festival, which ended Sunday, also hurriedly organized counterprogramming, billed as a “right of reply” for critics of Ms. Shriver, whose speech belittled the movement against cultural appropriation. They scheduled the rebuttal opposite a session Saturday afternoon in which Ms. Shriver was promoting her new novel, “The Mandibles. ” Ms. Shriver had been billed as speaking on “community and belonging” but focused on her views about cultural appropriation, a term that refers to the objections by members of minority groups to the use of their customs or culture (or even characters of their ethnicity) by artists or others who do not belong to those groups. Ms. Shriver criticized as runaway political correctness efforts to ban references to ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation from Halloween celebrations, or to prevent artists from drawing on ethnic sources for their work. Ms. Shriver, the author of 13 novels, who is best known for her 2003 book, “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” was especially critical of efforts to stop novelists from cultural appropriation. She deplored critics of authors like Chris Cleave, an Englishman, for presuming to write from the point of view of a Nigerian girl in his   book “Little Bee. ” Ms. Shriver noted that she had been criticized for using in “The Mandibles” the character of a black woman with Alzheimer’s disease, who is kept on a leash by her homeless white husband. And she defended her right to depict members of minority groups in any situation, if it served her artistic purposes. “Otherwise, all I could write about would be          white women from North Carolina,” she said. Ms. Shriver donned a sombrero for much of her speech  —   an allusion to a case in the United States in which articles of impeachment were drawn up (and later rescinded) against   student government members for doing the same during a   tequila party at Bowdoin College. To frequent laughter from the audience, Ms. Shriver warned that the    movement that began in America had already reached Britain  —   where she lives most of the year  —   and might be headed to Australia. Actually, it seems to have already arrived. In the middle of Ms. Shriver’s speech on Thursday night, an Australian writer of Sudanese and Egyptian origin, Yassmin   got up and walked out, making live posts on Twitter about her dismay at what she described as “a poisoned package wrapped up in arrogance and delivered with condescension. ” “I have never walked out of a speech,” Ms.   wrote in a post published on Medium. com and Guardian. com. But Ms. Shriver’s, she added, “became a celebration of the unfettered exploitation of the experiences of others, under the guise of fiction. ” The movement against cultural appropriation has grown in recent years, targeting singers like Miley Cyrus, who “twerk” onstage, and white men who wear  dreadlocks. After her Brisbane speech, Ms. Shriver was accosted by a festival participant in the hallway of the State Library of Queensland, who shouted, “How dare you come to my country and offend our minorities?” The author said that the woman had clearly not actually heard her speech, which made no mention of Australian minorities. The festival’s director, the poet Julie Beveridge, responded to the outrage by organizing the “right of reply” session, inviting as speakers Ms.   as well as the   author Suki Kim, whose   book “Without You, There Is No Us,” was based on her six months working undercover as an English teacher in North Korea. Ms. Kim complained that books by white male writers on North Korea were better received in some quarters than books like her own. Adam Johnson’s “The Orphan Master’s Son” won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2013, though Mr. Johnson did not speak Korean and had spent only three days in North Korea, Ms. Kim said. She attributed that acclaim at least partly to racism from institutions dominated by white men. “The reality is that those from marginalized groups, even today, do not get the luxury of defining their own place in a norm that is profoundly white, straight and, often, patriarchal,” Ms.   said in her criticism of Ms. Shriver. Ms. Beveridge wrote on the festival’s website, after links to Ms. Shriver’s speech were taken down, “As a festival of writers and thinkers, we take seriously the role we play in providing a platform for meaningful exchange and debate. ” She could not be reached on Monday to ask why links to Ms. Shriver’s speech were removed from the festival website. Links to the rebuttal remained active. Ms. Beveridge has said that the festival’s keynote speech was intended to set the tone for the festival, which drew scores of authors to this eastern Australian city. “Lionel Shriver, by her own admission, did not speak to her brief,” Ms. Beveridge said. “The views expressed during her address were hers alone. ” Ms. Shriver described the festival’s response as “not very professional,” and, at a later appearance at the festival, said she was disturbed by how many of those on the political left had become what she described as censorious and totalitarian in their treatment of artists with whom they disagreed.",0
"Trump U.S. antitrust nominee says will be independent of White House WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Makan Delrahim, who was chosen by President Donald Trump to be the top U.S. antitrust regulator, said on Wednesday that he would maintain independence from the White House in enforcing antitrust law. The Senate must still vote to confirm Delrahim. In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee overshadowed by repercussions over Trump’s firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, Delrahim reiterated that he would recuse himself from a fight over whether health insurer Anthem may merge with rival Cigna. Delrahim had worked for Anthem as a lobbyist when he was with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP. Obama’s Justice Department sued to stop the deal, and the case is currently under appeal. Asked what he would do if the White House wanted to discuss a deal being considered by the division, Delrahim said antitrust enforcement was law enforcement. “The independence of the decisions made in prosecuting and reviewing mergers as well as other conduct is a serious one that should be free from any political influence,” he said. “They will be free if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed.” Delrahim currently works in the White House as deputy assistant and deputy counsel to the president. If confirmed as expected, Delrahim’s antitrust division would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making. Former President Barack Obama’s administration faced a large number of megadeals in what one enforcer called a “merger tsunami” and blocked many of them. Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahim’s career expect him to follow in the footsteps of a former boss, Hewitt Pate, who was assistant attorney general for antitrust from 2003 to 2005. Delrahim was Pate’s deputy, specializing in international antitrust. Under Pate, the division was criticized for allowing too many deals, but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar. It tried but failed to stop Oracle Corp from buying PeopleSoft. If confirmed, Delrahim would oversee the Justice Department’s assessment of AT&T’s Inc plan to buy Time Warner Inc, the owner of HBO, Warner Brothers and news network CNN.  The department is reviewing major transactions in seeds and agricultural chemicals, like the mergers of Dow Chemical Co and Dupont, and of Bayer and Monsanto. Those proposed deals, along with ChemChina’s purchase of Syngenta, would consolidate six agricultural chemical companies into three. ",0
"Hillary Clinton: Supreme Court abortion ruling 'a victory for women' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday praised the Supreme Court ruling striking down Texas abortion restrictions as “a victory for women in Texas and across America.” “This fight isn’t over: The next president has to protect women’s health. Women won’t be ‘punished’ for exercising their basic rights,” she said in a tweet, a dig at Republican candidate Donald Trump, who once suggested women who get illegal abortions should face “some sort of punishment.” ",0
"Theresa May: National Threat Level Remains at Severe - ’A Terrorist Attack is Highly Likely’ - Breitbart United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May said Monday that the national threat level remains at “Severe,” meaning a terrorist attack is “highly likely. ”[“JTAC  —   that’s the independent Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre  —   have confirmed that the national threat level remains at Severe that means that a terrorist attack is highly likely,” she said after a meeting of top national security officials.  She said police have put additional security measures in place to protect the public and provide reassurance, including additional security measures at a number of bridges in London. May said all three attackers in Saturday’s attack have been identified, and that when “progress in the investigation permits,” their names will be released. She said 11 individuals are being held in police custody, following the search of two premises. Scotland Yard have subsequently identified two of the killers. “The police are working hard to establish the identity of all of those who were tragically killed or injured in the event on Saturday night, but it is now clear that, sadly, victims came from a number of nationalities. This was an attack on London and the United Kingdom, but it was also an attack on the free world,” the Prime Minister said. There were seven people killed and at least 48 injured, including 21 critically, after the three attackers drove into pedestrians on the London Bridge, then got out and began stabbing people at pubs and restaurants at the Borough Market. The three attackers were shot and killed by police. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley urged anyone with information or footage of the incident to contact police. He said the public can expect to see additional police  —   both armed and unarmed  —   across London. “Our secrity and policing plans for events are being reviewed. The public will also see an increased physical measures in order to keep public safe on London’s bridges,” he said. Rowley said the investigation was progressing “at pace, and significant progress has been made. “Finally, I ask the public to remain calm but vigilant  —   and if you see anything suspicious, no matter how insignificant you might think it is, please contact the   hotline on 0800 789 321. It may be a vital piece of information. ”",0
"Trump's daughter Ivanka joined call with Argentina's Macri BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Ivanka Trump, daughter of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, briefly joined her father’s telephone call with Argentine President Mauricio Macri earlier this month, Macri’s spokesman said on Tuesday. The two men spoke on Nov. 14, making Macri one of few Latin American leaders who had spoken with Trump in the days following his surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election. The call was aimed at rekindling a relationship formed when they worked as businessmen before entering politics.     “At the end of the president’s call with Trump, the phone was passed to Ivanka so he could say hello. They have known each other since she was quite young,” the spokesman said in an emailed response to a question about the call from Reuters. The congratulatory call was aimed at re-establishing the “personal bond” that the two men formed while doing business together, Argentine Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra said, although Macri had publicly expressed his preference for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. The Macri spokesman denied reports in the Argentine press on Monday that during the call Trump mentioned a pending office tower project that the real estate mogul has been trying to get approved by city regulators in Buenos Aires.  Photographs taken inside a meeting room at Trump Tower last week showed Trump was also accompanied by Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner when he met with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The son of one of the richest men in Argentina, Macri ended 12 years of leftist rule in Latin America’s third-largest economy when he took office last December. He was one of the regional presidents who have worked hardest to improve relations with the United States under President Barack Obama. Macri met Trump decades ago while working for his father, Francisco Macri. According to a book by the elder Macri, his son beat Trump in a golf game during a complicated real estate deal in New York in the 1980s, and Trump broke his clubs after the game in frustration. ",0
"Trump Sons Forge Ahead Without Father, Expanding and Navigating Conflicts - The New York Times President Trump’s old office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan sits unoccupied now, unofficial storage space for the gathering trove of memorabilia that his two oldest sons say they hope will eventually be turned over to their father’s presidential library. But just one flight down, in Eric and Donald Trump Jr. ’s cramped offices, their father is    —   in the seven copies of a recent issue of Golf Digest with his photo and the headline “  ” on the cover stacked on Eric’s desk in his visage looping endlessly on CNN (yes, they watch CNN) in the cardboard cutout of the president watching from behind a stash of blueprints in the corner. This is the conundrum facing the two brothers as they assume control of the empire their father built: How do they move forward, and navigate the ethical shoals, at a business predicated entirely on the brand of the man they have vowed to distance themselves from? “His DNA will always be in the company in a big way,” Eric said, during nearly five hours of interviews over two days last week at Trump Tower. “His DNA built the company. His DNA also built us. We’re extensions of him in so many ways. ” Both he and Don Jr. insist that they do not need their father’s input to run the company  —   the apprentices have become the boss. And even as questions remain about potential conflicts of interest, they say, unapologetically, that they plan to forge ahead with expanding the Trump Organization’s footprint, both in the United States and abroad. On Saturday, in fact, they will cut ribbon at their company’s newest branded property, billed as a “magnificent golf course” in the booming United Arab Emirates city of Dubai, before hundreds of Emirati power brokers. A week later they will head to Vancouver, British Columbia, for another opening celebration, of the latest Trump International Hotel and Tower, one of a dozen major international projects still underway, from the Dominican Republic to India. Back home in the United States, they are planning to open a new boutique hotel chain,  Scion, in perhaps 30 cities. With the aggressive push forward, though, comes the persistent thrum of ethical qualm. Just last week, news that Eric had traveled to the Dominican Republic to restart a stalled project there prompted controversy, given the Trump Organization’s pledge of no new overseas deals. The Washington Post reported that when Eric visited Uruguay on business in January, the trip cost taxpayers nearly $100, 000 in hotel bills for the required Secret Service agents and for embassy staff members. Also echoing through the office at Trump Tower was the   over the decision by Nordstrom and several other retailers to stop selling their sister Ivanka’s clothing line. Don Jr. called that “disgusting,” and both brothers said their father was right to take Nordstrom and other retailers to task publicly in Ivanka’s defense. “He’s Papa Bear,” Eric said. Despite pressure to do so, President Trump has not sold any of his assets, which include a stake in a   office buildings, more than a dozen golf courses and at least 15 hotels that the company owns or manages. Instead, he has signed over control of    operations of his privately held company to the two sons and Allen Weisselberg, a trusted lieutenant at the Trump Organization, with an agreement not to discuss company business. The arrangement and the president’s decision to not release his taxes have brought widespread criticism from liberal groups and even the federal government’s top ethics watchdog, Walter M. Shaub Jr. the director of the Office of Government Ethics. President Trump has continued to frequent his commercial properties, including over the weekend in Florida, bringing them global media attention and potential new customers. But the brothers say they are convinced that they and their father have taken sufficient steps to create a management structure that will allow them to avoid creating the kind of appearance of conflict of interest that plagued Hillary Clinton as secretary of state while her husband continued to operate the Clinton Foundation. The measures they have taken, they say, have included explicit instructions to their domestic and international business partners not to reach out to anyone in the United States government for help. The brothers’ expressions tightened and their voices rose when they were asked, in separate interviews, about suggestions that their father was using the presidency as a way to enhance the family’s profits. “Who in their right mind would try to enrich themselves by spending a fortune to run against 17 seasoned politicians on the Republican side, to then go up against the Clinton machine, Wall Street, Hollywood, P. C. culture?” Don Jr. asked. “To use that as the way to enrich yourself is laughable. ” The family, he added, would face heat whatever it did. If the Trump Organization sold its assets, there would be allegations of impropriety, as foreign investors would most likely be involved. If it liquidated and put the cash into the bank, he said, his father would be accused of artificially inflating interest rates for personal gain. For critics, though, particularly Democrats in Congress, the continuation of the global operations of the Trump Organization  —   even if President Trump is not directly involved  —   is fraught with problems, with even some Republican observers questioning whether the brothers can steer clear of trouble, regardless of their intentions. Even with no new foreign deals, the company is in a position to get tax breaks and other business inducements from state and local officials. While such incentives are hardly unusual for growing businesses, with this family business they will unavoidably raise questions of whether different players involved might be seeking special White House favors. “People are going to offer them sweetheart deals,” said Peter Schweizer, the conservative author whose book “Clinton Cash” argued, among other things, that Mrs. Clinton had used her position as secretary of state to favor donors to the foundation. “It is just the way it works, as it comes down to the fact that people want access to national leaders in the country, and unfortunately in the past, be it Billy Carter, Neil Bush or Roger Clinton, relatives become vehicles to accomplishing that,” Mr. Schweizer added, referring to relatives in past administrations who drew scrutiny because of their business activities. The two oldest brothers have worked in various roles at the Trump Organization for much of their adult lives, but without their father’s daily presence  —   and with the departure of Ivanka from the company offices  —   their responsibilities have grown. Eric Trump, 33, oversees construction and says he, not his father, is now the named officer on hundreds of Trump companies. Don Jr. 39, is in charge of commercial leasing, as well as many of the remaining companies. And while they share a certain      look, their personalities are distinct. Don Jr. the Trump child with the clearest memory of the divorce that split up his family, is the most publicly confident, and the most politically conservative. Eric appears more cautious, more worried about how what he says will be perceived. Yet neither is particularly shy. “There has never been a Trump that is introverted,” Eric said, laughing. What is it like  —   after a lifetime as the sons of Donald Trump, and now business executives in their own right, and even   in a reality television show  —   to be the sons of the president of the United States? “It’s bigger, it’s bigger,” Eric said, struggling for the right word, then turning to a superlative, a habit inherited from his father. “This is really the biggest thing in the world. ” For all the talk of its global reach, the Trump Organization still has a family feel to it. The small offices assigned to Eric, Ivanka and Don Jr. are lined up in a row, with Ivanka’s, like her father’s, sitting unused since she left the company and moved to Washington with her husband, Jared Kushner, who is serving as a senior White House adviser. During the recent snowstorm in New York  —   with schools closed for the day  —   Don Jr. who has five children, had his    daughter in the office, sharing breakfast sent up from a restaurant downstairs. Trump Tower, by and large, seems back to normal since the building’s most famous resident moved to Washington, though Secret Service agents are still stationed in the Trump Organization lobby and elsewhere. Just days before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump announced plans to resign from hundreds of entities he controls and place his assets in a trust. The move drew sharp criticism from ethics lawyers, who said the move was window dressing because Mr. Trump, as sole beneficiary of the trust, still owns the assets, benefits financially from any money they might make and will quite likely get updates, Eric said, roughly every quarter on the financial health of the company. Still, President Trump assigned control of the trust to Don Jr. and Mr. Weisselberg, with Eric as the sole member of what he described as an advisory council. The three men have to vote unanimously, Eric said, to make decisions regarding new deals and other major business decisions. To Don Jr. everything the company does these days seems to breed controversy. Much of it he says is unwarranted. For instance, people have questioned why corporate records in Delaware do not show that the president has resigned from his companies registered there. Eric says that he has, but that it can take more than a year for records there to be updated. And the brothers expressed irritation that their presence at their father’s announcement of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy provoked media reports that they were not honoring the agreement to stay clear of White House matters. In fact, they said, they were in Washington to visit the new Trump hotel in the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue and stopped by to say hello to their father and share in the historic moment. Don Jr. said he knew his father was busy, and had called him only once since his inauguration. Eric said he talked to his father “a few” times a week. But he insisted he knew which lines not to cross. “In the next four years, do I ever expect him to say: ‘Hey, how’s Turnberry? How’s the new green? How’s the new 10th tee? ’” Eric said. In a case like this, he said, he would probably say, “Dad, it’s great” and “The property looks awesome. ” He continued: “Am I ever going to say: ‘Listen. Hey, we have a tax issue’? No, no, no. There’s a difference. ” Recently the brothers stripped most of the photographs of their father and even his signature from the Trump Organization’s marketing material. And the new Scion hotel chain, which the company will brand and manage, does not feature the Trump name. Eric said they were hoping to locate Scion, offering a   alternative to their Trump International Hotel brand, in large to midsize “trendy” cities like Austin, Tex. Charlotte, N. C. and Nashville. One of the first Scion locations, Eric said, could be Dallas, where the brothers and their executive team are evaluating possible sites. They are in talks with a possible partner, Mukemmel Sarimsakci, a developer based in Texas who had previously considered projects with the Trump Organization in Iraq and Turkey, where he was born. Though the company runs the risk of becoming entangled with foreign partners on projects in the United States, and might have to deal with the suspicion that it got tax breaks and other incentives from local governments because of its ties to the White House, company officials say they decided not to stop domestic expansion because it is creating jobs for Americans. The Trump Organization said it had dropped a host of proposed projects overseas, including Trump Office Buenos Aires in Argentina Trump Towers Rio and Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, both in Brazil Trump International Hotel  Tower Baku in Azerbaijan Trump Tower Batumi in Georgia and Trump Riverwalk in Pune, India. Other deals still in the conceptual stage  —   including a possible office building in Dubai and towers in Australia, China, Israel and Vietnam  —   have also been shelved. “I was the first person to raise my hand and say you should not do certain deals, as I understood the optics, as you can’t build the tallest building in Tel Aviv and try to negotiate peace in the Middle East,” Eric said. He estimated that the company had canceled a billion dollars’ worth of deals  —   although this estimate could not be confirmed independently. Still, the company will continue to see through the dozen projects that the brothers say were underway before Inauguration Day and so do not qualify as new. They include two resorts in Indonesia Trump Tower Mumbai and a Trump tower in Gurgaon, also in India Trump Tower Punta del Este in Uruguay and a second golf club in Dubai, as well as the Dominican Republic resort, which was started in 2007 but stalled during the financial crisis. “That doesn’t mean the deal doesn’t continue to exist,” Eric said, amid the criticism last week that the project was a “new deal. ” Another Trump property in the ethical spotlight lately is    the oceanside estate turned private club in Palm Beach, Fla. that the president is styling as his winter White House. Mr. Trump arrived there again on Friday for a golfing visit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “There should be no intermingling of White House and business operations,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, who is troubled whether the president hosts the Japanese prime minister for free  —   at a commercial operation  —   or charges him, which would mean a foreign government official is paying Mr. Trump’s family. “There should be no intermingling of his private moneys with public affairs. ” Eric dismissed the questions as meaningless, comparing    to the Crawford, Tex. ranch of former President George W. Bush. He said his father was without peer when it came to forging friendships on the golf course, and his eyes grew wide as he talked about the family resort’s potentially becoming a place where world alliances are struck. To the Trump family, that mixing of business and officialdom  —   at least when it comes to their father’s visits  —   is just fine. “If he could do that with Putin, if he could do that with some of these horrible actors around the world who only want to compromise us as a country, and he can make them friends and they can have trust in one another, he just did something that not many presidents have been able to do,” Eric said.",0
"Saudi Arabia faces battle to repatriate assets after corruption crackdown DUBAI/ZURICH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has announced it will confiscate money and assets held by dozens of top officials and businessmen detained in an anti-corruption crackdown. But the experiences of two other Arab states trying to  recover stolen money, Egypt and Tunisia, suggest Riyadh may face years of legal and diplomatic battles to secure assets held abroad. Even then success is not guaranteed. The anti-corruption committee that detained princes, tycoons and ministers at the weekend has the power under a royal decree to take  whatever measures are deemed necessary  to seize companies, funds and other assets without waiting for the results of criminal investigations. The offshore scrutiny of assets has already begun in the Gulf region, where Saudi Arabia regularly shares information. The United Arab Emirates  central bank and securities regulator has asked banks and finance companies there to provide information on the accounts of 19 Saudi citizens, banking sources told Reuters on Thursday. The Saudi committee has not given details of the allegations individuals face, though Saudi officials say they include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain.  Riyadh has also set no timetable for its confiscations, although banking sources say more than 1,700 domestic bank accounts have already been frozen at the request of the central bank. If the committee were to try to retrieve all the revenue that has been lost to corruption, from bribes to illegal expropriation of land, the total would be $800 billion, an official at the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry has estimated. A large amount of the funds are believed by financial sources to be held offshore in bank accounts, portfolio investments, corporate shareholdings and real estate. Many of the businessmen detained have private planes   one has a Boeing 747 airliner. And a study by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research estimated Saudis have stashed away wealth equivalent to over 55 percent of the country s gross domestic product in foreign tax havens   an amount exceeding $300 billion. But Egypt and Tunisia s experiences show that although asset freezes can be arranged within months, repatriating the money can take many years. Cairo has tried unsuccessfully for five years to retrieve about 85 million pounds ($111 million)in British bank accounts belonging to the inner circle of former President Hosni Mubarak.  British officials have said they are bound by British law, which requires the Egyptians to provide them with criminal convictions first. Tunisia has so far recovered only a small portion of about $35 million claimed from Switzerland following the 2011 revolution that inspired the Arab Spring uprising. Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investment: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04 There are some precedents that could give Saudi Arabia cause for hope that it will be able to repatriate money.  Last year, Nigeria and Switzerland signed a deal paving the way for the return of over $300 million confiscated from the family of Nigeria s former military ruler Sani Abacha. Requests from Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria have led to nearly 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) of assets being frozen by Swiss authorities. But the efforts of Egypt and Tunisia to retrieve the money have stumbled over a requirement to submit evidence that would be admissible in Western legal systems, proving the beneficial owners of the assets and showing that corruption has taken place. Often assets are held in complex offshore vehicles making it hard to show who really owns them. Carlo Lombardini, a banking lawyer and professor of banking law at University of Lausanne, said Riyadh would have to provide detailed evidence proving how the money was obtained to seize assets in Switzerland on the grounds of corruption.  And then there is an issue whether this person in Saudi Arabia can defend themselves, and whether they benefit from a proper defense,  he said.  Saudi officials would have to satisfy Swiss authorities that owners of assets had been given due process. This could be difficult given the speed and the scale of the crackdown, and the sweeping powers given to the anti-corruption committee. The Saudi attorney-general said on Monday that detailed questioning of detainees had already produced  a great deal of evidence , but gave no more details. Senior Saudi officials did not respond to requests for information on the investigation. A Gulf-based lawyer familiar with international corruption cases said there were two channels through which Saudi Arabia could pursue assets abroad. In cases where Riyadh had a signed a treaty or convention with a foreign country, it could use this to obtain assistance gathering evidence before seeking to seize assets via the court system. However, Saudi Arabia does not have such a treaty with the United States, Switzerland and many other countries. Saudi Arabia could also send a letter of request to a relevant ministry in the other nation. This would be a test of its diplomatic influence in foreign capitals. Businessmen in detention include international investor Prince Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whose wealth was estimated by Forbes magazine before the crackdown at $17 billion; Mohammad al-Amoudi at $10.4 billion, with construction, agriculture and energy companies in Sweden, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia; and finance and healthcare magnate Saleh Kamel at $2.3 billion. Repatriating assets could be so hard that Riyadh may try to avoid foreign legal action altogether in many cases, instead making deals with detained tycoons and princes that in effect legalize their fortunes in exchange for a share of their money, some bankers and consultants say.   The government will also strike deals with businessmen and royals to avoid arrest, but only as part of a greater commitment to the local economy,  said Ayham Kamel, Eurasia Group s practice head, Middle East & North Africa in a note.

"Places to Put Your Hands Together - The New York Times Whether the music to your ears is pop, classical, jazz, country or another type of tune altogether, the rhythms of 2017 have you covered. Dance the days and nights away at Summerfest, June 28 to July 9 in Milwaukee, an   bonanza that includes 800 acts spread out across 11 stages at Henry Maier Festival Park on Lake Michigan. The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pink are among the headline performers this year, the festival’s 50th, but other genres such as   classic rock, Latin and reggae are also represented. The Monterey International Pop Festival, June 16 to 18 in Monterey, Calif. is also turning 50 this year, and celebrating in style, on the same weekend and at the same location  —   the Monterey County Fair and Events Center  —   where the original festival was held in 1967. That event helped establish the careers of many legendary musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Who and the Grateful Dead, and this year, over the course of three days, nine bands will take the stage to pay tribute to them. In Monte Carlo, it’s all jazz all the time at the 12th annual   Jazz Festival (November and December, exact dates to be determined) featuring performances by the world’s top jazz players such as Manu Katché, the drummer and singer, the bassist Richard Bona, and Ibrahim Maalouf, the trumpet player, all of whom were guests in 2016. The heart of the action takes place at the Opéra Garnier   an ornate   building, but the shows spill over into the Casino de   and glitzy oceanfront bars. Mellower sounds are in store on the Caribbean island of Mustique from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1, at the Mustique Blues Festival, a   secret among discerning fans. The event unfolds over nearly two weeks at the beachside Basil’s Bar, where spectators can sip sundowners while listening to the music of renowned blues players from around the world, including the San   guitarist and singer Joe Louis Walker. Festivalgoers should be on the lookout for other attendees, both famous and not, giving impromptu shows Mick Jagger and Michael Kors have jumped on stage in past years to belt out the blues before a stunned crowd. On the classical music scene, a prestigious orchestra celebrates a big birthday while another is born. In Austria, the Vienna Philharmonic is marking its 175th anniversary with more than 100 concerts throughout the year, including the free and   Summer Night Concert Schönbrunn on May 25, in the Baroque gardens of Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace, and four opera productions at the Salzburg Festival in Salzburg from July 21 to Aug. 30, most notably “Aida,” in which the Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko will sing the title role. And in Germany, Hamburg anticipates a January opening for the Elbphilharmonie, a striking new building set atop a former warehouse, with a glass facade, a scalloped roofline and two concert halls. Festivities at the new cultural landmark will unfold all year, like the ¡Viva Beethoven! series, March 19 to 23, when the highly regarded Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel will conduct. In Montreal, traditional opera takes on a contemporary edge with “Another Brick in the Wall,” on select dates from March 11 to 24 the production honors the city’s 375th anniversary and is based on Pink Floyd’s 1979 album “The Wall. The band’s chief songwriter, Roger Waters, collaborated with Opéra de Montréal on the work, which is inspired by his life. There are stories of isolation and the destruction of love, and it promises to be   and emotional, just the way a captivating opera should be.",0
"United resumes Newark-Delhi flights after halt due to poor air quality NEW YORK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - United Airlines said it had resumed flights from Newark, New Jersey to New Delhi, India on Sunday, after suspending the service temporarily over concerns about poor air quality in the Indian capital. UA Flight 82 had been canceled on Friday and Saturday, data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed, while the airline s website said it had waiver policies in place for passengers traveling to, from or through Delhi until Monday. UA Flight 82 has resumed operations, but  we will continue to monitor conditions over the next few days , a spokesman said. The third-largest U.S carrier is monitoring advisories as the New Delhi region remains under a public health emergency, and is coordinating with respective government agencies, the United Airlines spokesman had earlier told Reuters. Last week, New Delhi declared a pollution emergency as toxic smog hung over the city for days, with tourism operators reporting cancellation of bookings for the Christmas holidays. U.S. rivals Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc said they do not operate flights to New Delhi, while several Asian airlines contacted by Reuters said they had not canceled flights.  Verisk Maplecroft, a risk consultancy, says India has the worst air quality out of a list of 198 countries it measures, and that New Delhi ranks among the world s top 10 most polluted cities with many urban areas around the capital also among those with the worst air quality.  At the national level, India tops the index rankings (i.e. the country with the worst air quality), followed by Bangladesh and Thailand,  said Richard Hewston, Verisk Maplecroft s global head of environment and climate change. The company s Air Quality Index assesses the atmospheric concentrations of fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, known as PM 2.5.   A U.S. embassy measure of PM 2.5 showed a reading of 481 in New Delhi on Monday morning, local time. The outer limit of  good  air is 50. ",0

Trump, coquettish Amber Rose and Rihanna, a cherubic Anna Wintour and Pollyannaish Taylor Swift  —   a rogues’ gallery including Bill Cosby, Chris Brown and Ray J, and arguably three of the most famous   in modern times: Caitlyn, Kim, and Kanye. So lifelike, they even breathe, chests rising and falling as if deep in REM sleep. Seven figures for all that  —   plus the bedspread and the batteries to animate the doppelgängers  —   a number that was floated among attendees at Blum  Poe, the gallery that hosted the private exhibition last weekend. A source close to Mr. West claimed “Famous” would go on tour. Others vacillated between skepticism and quiet acquiescence at the estimate. But the gallery’s   Tim Blum, called it “a good ballpark. ” “I did the math in my head, and it took $500, 000 to a million just to make it,” said Aaron Axelrod, a Los Angeles artist who last month startled audiences by   mapping Frank Lloyd Wright’s Hollyhock House. “ This caught me off guard. It’s one of the coolest pieces I’ve ever seen, which is kind of annoying because it’s Kanye West. ” Solipsism aside, the biggest wow, Mr. Axelrod says, is breathing life into the sculptures, since “this was made for the music video, no one would have been able to tell [how] those sculptures were moving. Which means he’s going above and beyond. ” On Saturday, upon early arrival at the exhibition, technicians were still setting up a    straight out of the   classic “ . ” They toyed with audio, and plugged in   batteries to make the creations come alive. And when they did, the automatons were eerily real. Slumbering as if in a   suspended animation. Yet the most interesting part of the story is the one that didn’t make the final cut. “I think Monday of last week, I got a call from Scooter Braun,” said Mr. Blum of Blum  Poe, referring to the man who discovered Justin Bieber and who is now part of Mr. West’s management team. “Kanye suddenly felt the urge to show the work,” Mr. Blum continued. “Long story short, we made it happen. We pushed some things around and five days later, we had a show. Monday hey, Friday open. ” But why open a day before Mr. West’s “Saint Pablo” tour, two days before the V. M. A. s? It seemed sheer whim, Mr. Blum indicated. Mr. West wanted an art world unveiling, a piece that members of his creative collective, DONDA, said had taken four months of animation modeling,   scanning, stylist consulting, Instagram searches. The result was startlingly accurate. Each animatronic body was   down to the freckles and hair (human!) all applied by hand,    and none more ghoulish than Mr. Cosby’s freckles or Mr. Trump’s fleshy behind. Since Mr. West’s “Graduation” album cover was crafted by Takashi Murakami, a client of Blum  Poe, the gallery was a natural fit. When asked about the multimillion price point, Mr. Blum laughed. It is on sale  —   “for the right buyer,” he said. When you tally the materials needed, labor and Mr. West’s name, the $4 million price tag doesn’t seem so outlandish. “I would project a figure about that,” Mr. Blum said. “To be honest, we did it for the sake of doing it,” Mr. Blum continued. “The show and project were not done with price or sale in mind. But I would act upon it as every other piece of art I handle. ” The show lasted one weekend. Like the man himself, flighty and busy, Mr. West showed up for a few minutes via an onscreen avatar on Friday night. That’s it. “Kanye is Kanye,” said his trainer of three years, Joe Bouraima, a French national whom Mr. West had helped to secure a visa after a fortuitous 2013 meeting in Paris. Ever since, the hulking Mr. Bouraima has been on and off tour with the artist for months, training daily while working on “Famous. ” Not once did Mr. West mention the project. And then, just like that, the mercurial Mr. West decided to stage the   show in Los Angeles  —   and then it was gone. Poof. But to where? A member of Mr. West’s team said that the piece was “on its way to its next location. ” She wouldn’t share where, but Mr. Blum said he could picture “Famous” in a large museum. “I have friends who are directors of museums,” he said. “This is a thing you could see at Lacma [Los Angeles County Museum of Art] MOCA or the Hammer very easily. ” Representatives from the Hammer Museum said they had no such plans, but Mr. Blum mentioned that he and Mr. Braun were actively shopping the piece’s next home. The cliché rings true that all art is imitation, and “Famous” was heavily inspired by Vincent Desiderio’s “Sleep,” which was based on Jackson Pollock’s “Mural” painting. And though “Famous” wasn’t built by Mr. West’s own hand, the concept and direction were his own. Ask others who borrow liberally  —   such as Werner Herzog or Mr. Desiderio  —   all are steadfast that this work is art. Michelangelo, Quentin Tarantino and Chuck Close, have each had assistance to make their ideas come to life. Why should this be any different? “Art is really just an idea,” Mr. Axelrod said. “It’s follow through and direction. What makes a great artist nowadays is being able to put together a team. And he was willing to give up money to put his ideas to life. ” Maybe the greatest quality an artist can possess today isn’t skill or talent  —   it’s commitment to making a vision real. That means money and time. To create something to make the masses remember your name. What else is fame for?",0
"Mistrial for 2 Ex-Officers in Albuquerque Killing of Mentally Ill Man - The New York Times ALBUQUERQUE  —   After two full days of deliberations, a jury here announced on Tuesday that it had failed to reach a verdict in the murder trial of two former police officers for the 2014 shooting death of a homeless man with paranoid schizophrenia. “Police officers have a very difficult job,” the special prosecutor, Randi McGinn, said after the announcement. “The discussion we need to have as a community is, do we want a Dirty Harry or do we want a peace officer? This is the discussion we need to have here in Albuquerque. ” After polling the six men and six women on the jury, Judge Alisa Hadfield declared a mistrial. It was not immediately clear if prosecutors would seek another trial. The two former officers, Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez, had each faced a   murder charge in the shooting of the man, James Boyd, who had been illegally camping on a craggy mountainside on the city’s east end. Mr. Sandy also faced a lesser charge of aggravated battery. “These are two good men,” Sam Bregman, one of the defense lawyers, said after the announcement. “Let these two good men get on with their lives. ” The case went to the jury on Thursday after 12 days of testimony. Halfway through the trial, Judge Hadfield granted a defense motion to dismiss voluntary manslaughter charges against Mr. Sandy and Mr. Perez, ruling that prosecutors had failed to provide enough evidence to support the charge. The case highlighted the challenges posed by the growing number of people with severe mental disorders who, in the absence of adequate mental health services, become entangled with the police. “These officers have suffered the consequences of decisions by elected official to not allocate sufficient resources for the mentally ill,” Mr. Bregman argued in his closing statement. Testifying that they used their training to guide the decisions they made on March 16, 2014, both former officers took the stand in their own defense  —   a rarity because of the risks it carries, said Douglas Colbert, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Francis King Carey School of Law who has written extensively about police misconduct. “Police testimony could eliminate a juror’s uncertainty and lead to conviction,” Professor Colbert said. On the other hand, “the officer may gain sympathy from the juror who now understands the officer’s tough,   decision to make or subjective fear or danger. ” Much of the encounter was registered on body and helmet cameras worn by some of the officers, including Mr. Perez. The video, when released, prompted large street protests here. Only three of the 12 jurors voted to convict the officers. Ms. McGinn said the division among them mirrored the split in the community, where some saw the actions in the video as justified and others did not. By the time the two officers arrived at the standoff with Mr. Boyd, the episode had been going on for more than two hours. His conversations with police officers had ranged from calm and humorous to delusional. Holding a pocketknife in each hand, Mr. Boyd repeatedly said that he had worked for the Defense Department and that he could get the officers killed “with a phone call. ” In his testimony, Mr. Perez, 35, drew a distinction between the images registered by his helmet camera and the encounter as he experienced it, using still frames from the video as his guide. When he arrived at 7:10 p. m. Mr. Perez said, Mr. Boyd went from calm to threatening “almost instantaneously,” and he refused to obey orders to drop the knives and get on the ground. “Going frame by frame like that, we’re able to pick apart every little detail,” Mr. Perez said. “The way it happened that day, it happened in the blink of an eye, at the speed of life. ” He told Ms. McGinn that he never saw Mr. Boyd lunge toward the officers but that he “had a feeling he was going to lunge forward. ” That distinction framed Ms. McGinn’s closing argument. The trial, she told jurors, was ultimately about the “  argument” that “anticipatory shootings” are justifiable and the “modern, 2014 version” that the police may not shoot unless someone is in fact attacking them. “Society gives police officers a tremendous amount of power,” Ms. McGinn said. “We give them guns  —   not just side arms, but long guns  —   and we give them a license to kill. But it is a limited license. ” Officers had hastily devised a plan to subdue Mr. Boyd before dark, but nothing appeared to go as expected. He stood unfazed when a   grenade exploded near him. Mr. Perez testified that from where he stood, Mr. Boyd seemed to be “within arm’s reach” of a K9 officer, Scott Weimerskirch, who was retrieving his dog. Mr. Boyd was, in fact, 10 feet away. Mr. Perez said he saw Mr. Boyd move a hand toward his waistband and “perceived an immediate, deadly threat. ” Mr. Sandy, who was standing behind Officer Weimerskirch, said Mr. Boyd pulled out his knives and took a slight step to the left. “He was going to try to flank us,” Mr. Sandy, 41, testified. “He was going to attack us from a different angle. That’s when I made the decision to shoot. ” Mr. Sandy and Mr. Perez each fired three shots, striking Mr. Boyd in the arms and back as he turned away from the officers, his backpack slung on his shoulder. Mr. Sandy retired after the shooting, and Mr. Perez was fired. During the trial, Ms. McGinn portrayed Mr. Sandy differently from Mr. Perez. She began her   of Mr. Perez by thanking him for his service  —   he is a decorated Iraq war veteran who had a spotless record with the Albuquerque police until Mr. Boyd’s shooting. “I can’t tell you how sorry I am that you were sent up there into the mess some other officer created,” she told him. In contrast, she portrayed Mr. Sandy as an officer with a tarnished record, whose actions fueled the confrontation. Mr. Sandy spent time on the stand discussing his firing from the New Mexico State Police in 2007, after he was caught moonlighting while on the job. He also apologized for saying that he was going to shoot Mr. Boyd “with a Taser shotgun” almost as soon as he arrived at the scene.",0
"Russia warns it is close to retaliating after new U.S. sanctions bill: Ifax MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said it had repeatedly warned the United States it would retaliate against what it saw as hostile moves and was growing tired of showing restraint, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, the Interfax news agency reported. Ryabkov’s comments came after the U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to slap new sanctions on Russia and force President Donald Trump to obtain lawmakers’ permission before easing any sanctions on Moscow.

"More than 100 dead in Philippine mudslides, flooding: officials MANILA (Reuters) - A tropical storm in the southern Philippines triggered mudslides and flash floods that killed more than 100 people, while dozens are missing, police and disaster officials said on Saturday. The casualties, most of them caused late on Friday, were all on the main southern island of Mindanao, they said, adding three provinces were hardest hit. Disaster officials said many residents had ignored warnings to leave coastal areas and riverbanks.  Many people were swept to the sea as flood waters quickly rose due to the high tide,  Manuel Luis Ochotorena, a disaster agency official, said.  They never heeded the warnings. They thought it was a weak storm but it dumped more rains.   Hundreds of kilometers to the east, army and emergency workers were checking reports an entire village was buried by mudslide in Tubod town in Lanao del Norte. Ryan Cabus, a local official, said power and communication lines to the area had been cut, complicating rescue efforts. The weather bureau said the storm had gathered strength over the Sulu Sea and was packing winds of up 80 kph (50 mph) and moving west at 20 kph.  It was heading out over the sea by midday on Saturday and would have moved clear of the Philippines by Monday, it said. Emergency workers, soldiers, police and volunteers were being mobilized to search for survivors, clear debris, and restore power and communications. More than 100 deaths were reported in various places  including 60 in Tubod, El Salvador and Munai towns in Lanao del Norte province. In Zamboanga del Norte province, police said 42 people had been killed in the towns of Sibuco and Salug. Three people were killed in Bukidnon province, while politicians in Lanao del Sur province said 18 people had drowned in flash floods there. Sixty-four people were reported missing in floods and landslides, according to a tally of reports form officials and police. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons every year, bringing death and destruction, usually to the poorest communities.  Last week, 46 people were killed in the central Philippines when a typhoon hit. In 2013, super typhoon Haiyan killed nearly 8,000 people and left 200,000 families homeless.    ",0
"Court orders Nigeria to pay $288 million to 1967 war victims ABUJA (Reuters) - A court on Monday ordered Nigeria to pay 88 billion naira ($288 million) in damages to victims of the 1967 civil war for failure to fully de-mine and clear the land of other weaponry after the end of hostilities.  The ruling calls on the government to pay 50 billion naira directly to war victims in 11 states and put 38 billion naira toward de-mining and the construction of schools, courts, churches and mosques in the affected areas.  A judge for the Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice ruled that there remain  large quantities  of live bombs deprived communities of farmland since the civil war ended in 1970.      Sovereign states do not have to respect the court s rulings and there is no framework for making them binding. The office of President Muhammadu Buhari did not immediately comment on the ruling.  A million people died in the 1967-70 civil war over the short-lived Republic of Biafra. ($1 = 305.3000 naira) ",0
"Chris Paul’s Fast Hands and Gruesome Fingers - The New York Times LOS ANGELES  —   Chris Paul examined his crooked knuckles and the surgical scars that form tiny road maps on his hands. He has torn various ligaments in his thumbs and has broken bones in his fingers. He has worn casts and splints. His hands, though, are the indispensable tools of his trade, no matter how gruesome they look. “I’ve got the worst fingers,” he said. Paul, the starting point guard for the Los Angeles Clippers, long ago established himself as one of the N. B. A. ’s premier defenders. He has collected more steals than any other active player in the league: 1, 892 and counting. A     he clutters passing lanes. He strips dribbles like paint thinner. Doc Rivers, his coach, has concluded that Paul has the best hands he has ever seen. “Gifted,” Rivers said during an interview in January. “His hands are so damn quick. ” Three days after Rivers offered this assessment, Paul paid the price for possessing such gifts. In a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, he jammed his left thumb fighting through a screen, tearing his ulnar collateral ligament  —   not to be confused with his radial collateral ligament, the one he tore on his right thumb training for the Olympics in 2012. Few people on the planet have firsthand knowledge of the difference between R. C. L. and U. C. L. tears. Paul is one of them. (They both hurt, he said.) As for his most recent injury, Paul missed 14 games before he returned late last month. Even now, with the Clippers vying for playoff position, he is trying to regain his feel for the game. “I see plays all the time where I know I can reach for the ball and I know I can steal it,” he said. “But it’s like risk versus reward: Do I go for it?” Such is life for Paul, who cannot help putting his hands in harm’s way. He tore ligaments in his right middle finger in March 2010. He fractured his left index finger in October 2015. He broke his right hand last April, and he continues to play with 16 pins and a metal plate embedded in his palm. He shoots with that hand. In the process, he has become something of an expert on hands for colleagues. After J. R. Smith of the Cleveland Cavaliers fractured his right thumb in December, Paul called him to offer tips on his rehabilitation. Whenever Paul himself jams a thumb or sprains a finger, the first person he usually hears from is Matt Barnes, a former teammate who now plays for the Golden State Warriors. “Because he gets his fingers hit all the time,” said Paul, who is averaging 17. 6 points, 9. 2 assists and 1. 9 steals a game. “He understands. ” The challenge for Paul is that he relies on his hands. He is not, by his own admission, one of the league’s most awesome physical specimens. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds. He is not particularly fast and does not jump especially high. But he has exceptional reflexes and a knack for anticipating plays. “He could have been a boxer,” Rivers said. “I don’t know if he could have taken a punch, but he could have landed some for sure. ” Growing up in North Carolina, Paul worked to develop hand speed and coordination. He was almost never without a ball, he said. He also watched the game constantly, studying how other players dribbled and passed, and all the angles they used to create space. He determined that there were a finite number of possibilities. “Not being the most athletic player,” he said, “I’ve always had to understand where you’re going with the ball. ” He recorded his first N. B. A. steal before he scored his first N. B. A. points, intercepting an errant pass before racing away for a layup. His professional career was less than four minutes old. In 2008, he set an N. B. A. record by going 108 straight games with at least one steal. “I think that one’s going to be hard to break,” he said. Jamal Crawford, his teammate, said that Paul had an encyclopedic knowledge of his opponents thanks to his experience and his tireless analysis of game film. “He’s ahead of the play,” Crawford said. Metta World Peace, a veteran forward with the Los Angeles Lakers and a former defensive player of the year, cited Paul’s “hunger. ” Few players, for example, are more skilled at recovering the ball if it happens to get stolen away. “Oh, I’m getting it back,” Paul said. “I want it. I want it. ” But Paul said that no one had better hands than Brevin Knight, a point guard who retired in 2009 and now works as an analyst for the Memphis Grizzlies’ television broadcasts. As a kid, Knight knew that the only way he was going to earn his way onto the prime playground courts near his home in East Orange, N. J. was by playing great defense. “Being smaller, you have to figure out a way for people to want to pick you so you’re not just sitting there on the side watching,” he said in a telephone interview. “It stuck with me from there. ” Knight described himself as a “tendency person. ” He could study an opponent for two possessions, he said, and get a feel for what that player liked to do with the ball. Paul is the same way. “He has the ability to look as though the he is not engaged defensively, but he’s really there,” Knight said. “It’s his way of luring the offensive guy into thinking, ‘Oh, I’ve got an easy move here.’ ” In retirement, Knight has found that his good hands  —   along with excellent peripheral vision  —   are still useful when he broadcasts games. Occasionally, he said, a loose ball will rocket toward the courtside table where he and Pete Pranica, the Grizzlies’    voice, are calling the action. Knight tries to save Pranica first, he said, and the courtside monitor second. “Because these teams have enough money,” Knight said, “they can replace a monitor. ” Rivers knows about defense, too. During his   playing career, he came away with 1, 563 steals and the mangled instruments of his profession. “I mean, honestly, look at my fingers,” said Rivers, who stretched his hands before him and stared at them as if they had been assembled by Picasso. Rivers was constantly putting his hands in danger. He described himself as a “reacher. ” He reached for loose balls. He reached for deflections. And he reached into the midsections of opposing point guards, committing an average of one foul for every nine minutes of playing time. Paul, on the other hand, goes about 14 minutes between fouls. “I’m amazed how clean he gets steals in traffic,” Rivers said. Not that he is immune from workplace hazards. One of Paul’s more devastating injuries occurred last April, against the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs. As Portland’s Gerald Henderson drove for a layup, Paul used his left hand to strip the ball away from Henderson. The problem was that Paul entangled his right hand in the back of Henderson’s jersey. He led a fast break in the other direction, but the damage was done: He had broken the third metacarpal in his right palm. The Clippers lost the next two games and the series without him. “Right when he did it, you could see me react on the sideline,” said Rivers, who did not react well. “I knew what it was. Because I had done the exact same thing when I was playing. ” This season has been another exercise in perseverance for Paul, who sprained his left thumb at a preseason practice, which was bad enough. Then, in January, he tried to squeeze past that screen against Oklahoma City  —   a collision made worse by the Thunder’s Russell Westbrook, who tried to draw a foul by jumping into Paul. “I tried to shake it out because I’ve jammed my thumb a thousand times,” Paul said. “I thought it would calm down. But I could see how swollen it was. I said: ‘I tore it. I know I did.’ ” After spending several weeks squeezing a tiny rubber ball to rebuild the strength in his thumb, Paul has since returned to the court. He would like to stay there. “Just trying to keep my hands out of the way,” he said.",0

"Turkish President Returns to Istanbul in Sign Military Coup Is Faltering - The New York Times ISTANBUL  —   A military coup attempt plunged Turkey into a long night of violence and intrigue on Friday, threatening its embattled president, leaving nearly 200 dead and injecting new instability into a crucial NATO member and American ally in the chaotic Middle East. The coup attempt was followed hours later by an equally dramatic public appearance by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose whereabouts had been unknown for hours after the plotters claimed to have taken control. Flying into Istanbul Ataturk Airport from an undisclosed location early Saturday, Mr. Erdogan signaled that the coup was failing. “A minority within the armed forces has unfortunately been unable to stomach Turkey’s unity,” Mr. Erdogan said after the private television channel NTV showed him greeting supporters. Blaming political enemies, Mr. Erdogan said: “What is being perpetrated is a rebellion and a treason. They will pay a heavy price for their treason to Turkey. ” Mr. Erdogan suggested that the plotters had tried to assassinate him, referring to a bombing in the Turkish Mediterranean resort town of Marmaris after he left on Friday. “It would appear that they thought I was there,” he said. Supporters of Mr. Erdogan responded to his call to take to the streets in Istanbul, and by Saturday morning, the coup appeared to be unraveling. The   Anadolu Agency reported that about 200 unarmed soldiers had surrendered to the police in Ankara. CNN Turk showed video of soldiers abandoning tanks in Istanbul, and by morning, civilians were climbing onto the tanks and waving flags, according to images posted on social media. Anadolu said more than 1, 500 members of the armed forces linked to the plot had been detained across Turkey, including a brigadier general in the country’s northeast. Nonetheless, the abrupt turn of events in Turkey left Mr. Erdogan’s grip on power uncertain. The country has been reeling from a wave of deadly extremism by the Islamic State, struggling to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees from the war in neighboring Syria and fighting a resurgent Kurdish rebellion in the Turkish southeast. Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist who has dominated politics for more than a decade, has also alienated many Turks with his increasingly autocratic behavior. Turkey’s acting chief of general staff, Gen. Umit Dundar, said on Saturday that 194 people had been killed, and he called 104 of them “coup plotters. ” Of the 90 others killed, 47 were civilians, the general said at a news conference in Ankara, the capital. Seventeen police officers were killed in a military helicopter attack by coup plotters on a police special forces headquarters outside Ankara, Anadolu Agency had reported earlier. CNN Turk reported that 12 civilians had died in an explosion at the Parliament building. Martial law was declared after the coup attempt in the country, which has been convulsed by military takeovers at least three times in the past  . Before he made his televised remarks from the airport, Mr. Erdogan was forced to use his iPhone’s FaceTime app from a secret location to broadcast messages beseeching the public to resist the coup attempt. “There is no power higher than the power of the people,” he said amid contradictory accounts of who was in control. “Let them do what they will at public squares and airports. ” After Mr. Erdogan spoke, many followers obeyed his orders to go into the streets, and mosque loudspeakers urged his supporters to protest the coup attempt. The United States Embassy said in a statement that “shots have been heard in Ankara” and urged Americans to take shelter. Social media outlets worked intermittently or were blocked. The events began unfolding around 10 p. m. Friday as the military moved to stop traffic over two of Istanbul’s bridges, which cross the Bosporus and connect the European and Asian sides of the city. There were reports of gunfire in Taksim Square, in central Istanbul, where   supporters had gathered, but there were no reports of injuries, and it appeared that security forces were acting with restraint. On the Bosporus Bridge, closed earlier in the evening by the military, there were reports of gunfire as protesters approached, and according to NTV, three people were hurt. Some military officials spoke out against a coup, including the commander of the First Army, Gen. Umit Guler, who issued a statement, carried by a   news channel, saying, “The armed forces do not support this movement comprised of a small group within our ranks. ” Leaders of opposition political parties, who have otherwise worked against Mr. Erdogan’s government, also spoke out against a seizure of the government by the military. “This country has suffered a lot from coups,” Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main secular opposition party, the Republican People’s Party, known by its Turkish initials, C. H. P. said in a statement quoted by The Hurriyet Daily News. “It should be known that the C. H. P. fully depends on the free will of the people as indispensable of our parliamentary democracy. ” By 2 a. m. a large group of protesters had gathered at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, and the military had begun withdrawing, according to CNN Turk. In the back streets of Istanbul’s European districts, bars and restaurants were showing footage on television of scenes at the bridge, while partygoers were glued to their mobile phones trying to learn what was happening. “Some people illegally undertook an illegal action outside of the chain of command,” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said in comments broadcast on NTV. “The government elected by the people remains in charge. This government will only go when the people say so. ” After Mr. Yildirim spoke, factions of the Turkish military issued a statement, according to the news agency DHA, claiming they had taken control of the country. “Turkish armed forces seized the rule of the country completely with the aim of reinstalling the constitutional order, democracy, human rights and freedoms, to make rule of law pervade again, to   the ruined public order,” the statement quoted by DHA said. “All the international agreements and promises are valid. We hope our good relations with all global countries goes on. ” Senior Pentagon officials in Washington said they were still trying to determine what was happening in Turkey. They said the United States had not adjusted its military posture in the region. The Defense Department has roughly 2, 200 uniformed military personnel and civilians in Turkey. About 1, 500 of them are based at Incirlik, an air base in southern Turkey near Syria. The United States has used the base to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State. Since March, Incirlik has been on an “elevated force protection level” amid concerns that militants were targeting it. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter in May ordered all family members of military personnel based at Incirlik to leave the country. Mr. Erdogan placed blame for the coup attempt on followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in exile in Pennsylvania and who was once an ally before the two had a bitter   in 2013 over a corruption inquiry that targeted Mr. Erdogan and his inner circle. Over many years, followers of Mr. Gulen built up a presence in Turkey’s police and judiciary, and Mr. Erdogan blamed them for the corruption inquiry. Mr. Erdogan and his allies then purged the judiciary and the police of those linked to Mr. Gulen, going so far as to call him the leader of a terrorist organization and seeking, unsuccessfully, to have him extradited from the United States. Mr. Gulen denied any role in the attempted coup, saying he condemned it “in the strongest terms. ” “As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt,” he said in an emailed statement. “I categorically deny such accusations. ” Since the founding of modern Turkey in 1923, the military has staged coups in 1960, 1971 and 1980, and has intervened in 1997. The military had long seen itself as the guardian of the secular system, established by the country’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. But in recent years, a series of sensational trials had pushed the military back to its barracks, which analysts said had secured civilian leadership over the military. Across Istanbul on Friday night, rumors swirled and evening plans were upended. In the Arnavutkoy neighborhood, people flooded out of bars and restaurants, hailing taxis and urging loved ones to get home to safety. “There’s a coup,” one man shouted in the street. “There’s a coup, and blood will be shed. ” Mr. Erdogan attracted a   constituency in the early years of his tenure, including many liberals who supported his plans to overhaul the economy and remove the military from politics. But in recent years, he has alienated many Turks with his increasingly autocratic ways, cracking down on freedom of expression, imposing a significant role for religion in public life and renewing war with Kurdish militants in the southeast. “The people tried to stand up against President Erdogan, but they couldn’t, they were crushed, so the military had no choice but to take over,” said Cem Yildiz, a taxi driver. Mr. Yildiz said that recent terrorism in the country attributed to Islamic State militants, including an attack on Istanbul Ataturk Airport that killed dozens, was “the tipping point” for him. He blamed Turkey’s policy on Syria for the terrorist attacks. Early in the civil war there, Turkey supported rebel groups fighting the Syrian government. Many of the fighters who traveled through Turkey to Syria joined the Islamic State, and critics have blamed Mr. Erdogan for enabling its rise. “He has destroyed this country, and no one will stand up to him but the military,” Mr. Yildiz said. “There was no choice but this. ” Seyda Yilmaz, a teacher who was out in Istanbul on Friday when the news broke, said: “The country is in chaos, and Erdogan needs to be put in his place, but I’m afraid. I’m very afraid because in the past a lot of innocent blood was shed in these coups. I’m anxious. I don’t know what to say at this point. We are all in shock. ”",0
"Trump says strong Europe is important for U.S WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was in favor of a strong Europe, as France gears up for an election where European unity is a key issue and Britain negotiates its departure from the European Union. “Yes, a strong Europe is very, very important to me as president of the United States and it’s also ... important for the United States, we want to see it, we will help it be strong, and it’s very much to everybody’s advantage,” Trump said at a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.

"Report: More People Are Leaving New York Than Any Other Metro Area in the U.S. - Breitbart More people are leaving the New York metropolitan area than any other metropolitan area in the U. S. according to U. S. Census data. [More than one million people moved out of the New York area to another region since 2010, the New York Post reported.  The number of people leaving the area, which includes parts of New Jersey, Connecticut, the lower Hudson Valley, and Long Island, increased from 187, 034 in 2015 to 223, 423 in 2016. The number of international immigrants, on the other hand, decreased from 181, 551 to 160, 324 over the same period, records show. Experts say people are leaving the area due to the improving economy, an increase in jobs in cheaper places to live, and because retirees are seeking warmer climates. “The historical trend is that out migration grows when economy is getting better,” said Empire Center for Public Policy research director E. J. McMahon. “As the economy gets better there are more jobs outside the region and by the same token . . . more people to buy your house if you’re a baby boomer looking to move to Boca Raton or Myrtle Beach. ” Americans who choose to relocate are increasingly moving to Florida, Texas, and the Northwest from the Rust Belt and the eastern U. S. Even though people are fleeing the New York area, the region remains the most populous area in the country with a whopping 23. 7 million residents. The population of the New York region actually grew 2. 7 percent from 2010 to 2016 due to foreign arrivals and births, records show. Records from July 2016 show that New York City is on track to have 8. 6 million people by 2020, an increase from the current population of 8. 5 million. People may be fleeing the   area, but the state of Illinois has lost more residents than any other state for three years in a row, Breitbart News reported in December.",0
"Attorney General Sessions defends reply on Russia contacts WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday defended his conduct at a January confirmation hearing where he denied having contacts with Russian officials during the course of the presidential campaign when he was an adviser to Donald Trump. “My answer was correct,” Sessions, who last week said he would stay out of any probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, wrote in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. Sessions repeated that he spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, and again at his Senate office in Washington in September. At a news conference on Thursday, Sessions said he should have said during the confirmation hearing that he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator. The Washington Post first disclosed the meetings on Wednesday. Many Democrats, who are pushing for a broad probe of ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian operatives, have called for Sessions to resign. Sessions, then a U.S. senator from Alabama, was a high-ranking player in Trump’s 2016 campaign. Sessions’ denial of contacts with Russians had come in response to a question by Democratic Senator Al Franken about what he would do if reports of contacts between Trump associates and Russians were true. “I did not mention communications I had had with the Russian Ambassador over the years because the question did not ask about them,” Session wrote in the letter to Grassley, which he said was meant to supplement his January testimony. Sessions said his recusal would apply not just to any alleged Russian contact with the Trump campaign, but also with the Trump transition team and administration. “This should not be taken as any evidence of the existence of any such investigation or its scope,” he added. The Republican president has backed his attorney general and accused Democrats of blowing the issue out of proportion for political purposes. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump’s favor. Russia has denied the allegations. ",0
"Clinton's pantsuits inspire flashmob video (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton’s signature colorful pantsuits got a shout-out from dozens of women who staged a flashmob in support of the Democratic presidential candidate in Washington D.C. Dressed in red, black, blue and pink pantsuits, the group danced on Friday to “Salute” by British girl band Little Mix for a YouTube video organized by Clinton supporters called “DC Power Pantsuit Flashmob”. Organizer Jamie Poslosky said she came up with the idea because she was feeling depressed by the bitter rhetoric that has marked the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign between Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump. “I thought rather than sit and stew and be despondent I would try to find something really empowering and positive to do and clearly, as was shown here, there’s a real energy and desire by a lot of people to just be proud and loud and supportive,” Poslosky said. Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady who is hoping to become the first woman elected to the White House, has faced frequent scrutiny of her appearance during her years in the public eye including criticism of her hair style. Pantsuits have become her trademark in recent years. Opinion polls show Clinton and Trump in a close race ahead of Tuesday’s election.  ",0
"Tom Ford on Moving Back to US: Trump Made Me ’Feel More Nationalistic’ - Breitbart Iconic fashion designer Tom Ford is opening up about how Donald Trump’s election made him want to move back to America, and the “tremendous number of people” who “feel disenfranchised. ”[“Oddly, it made me want to come back even more,” Ford told Women’s Wear Daily.  “We have a tremendous number of people in this country who feel disenfranchised and clearly we are not relating to or speaking to them,” the   filmmaker explained. “I am at my core American, and it made me want to come back. It didn’t make me want to run away. ” Ford, a longtime Democrat who hosted a fundraiser for Obama, says Trump’s message resonated with a “big part of the country” that has felt ignored. “I think when you sense that there is a divide in your country and that there are people who perhaps you’re not relating to, and that those of us who are fortunate enough to live in a world of very liberal human rights and privilege, it’s a   call that we’re not addressing a big part of the country that does feel disenfranchised,” Ford said. Echoing the sentiments behind Trump’s “America First” political agenda, Ford says the billionaire’s victory made him “feel more nationalistic. ” “It made me feel more nationalistic if anything. The whole country is not like New York and L. A. and the world that I am used to living in. ” WWD reports Fords is planning to move from London to a   $39 million home in Los Angeles.

"U.S. military must accept transgender recruits by Jan. 1, judge rules (Reuters) - Transgender recruits will be able to join the U.S. military as of Jan. 1 after a federal judge on Monday denied a request by President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce his ban on transgender troops while the government appeals an order blocking it. In a ruling, with which the Pentagon said it would comply, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington refused to lift part of her Oct. 30 order stopping the ban from taking effect until the case is resolved, saying it likely violated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law.  The White House said the Justice Department was reviewing its options. The Pentagon said in a statement that it would follow court orders and begin processing transgender applicants on Jan. 1. It added, however, that it and the U.S. Department of Justice “are actively pursuing relief from those court orders in order to allow an ongoing policy review scheduled to be completed before the end of March.”  The administration had argued that the Jan. 1 deadline was problematic because tens of thousands of personnel would have to be trained on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants, and the military was not ready for that. Kollar-Kotelly rejected the concerns, saying preparations for accepting transgender troops were under way during the administration of Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama.  “The directive from the Secretary of Defense requiring the military to prepare to begin allowing accession of transgender individuals was issued on June 30, 2016 - nearly one and a half years ago,” the judge said.  Several transgender service members filed a lawsuit after Trump said in July he would ban transgender people from the military, citing concern over military focus and medical costs. In an August memorandum, Trump gave the military until March 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender individuals from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. The memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty personnel.  Defense Secretary James Mattis had previously delayed a deadline that had been set during the Obama administration to begin enlisting transgender recruits to Jan. 1, which Trump’s ban then put off indefinitely.  The Pentagon said on Monday there were a number of guidelines that would have to be met by the applicants.  It said that sex reassignment or genital reconstruction would be disqualifying factors unless a medical provider certified that a period of 18 months had passed since the most recent surgery, no complications persisted and additional surgeries are not required.  The service members who sued Trump, Mattis and military leaders in August had been serving openly as transgender people in the U.S. Army, Air Force and Coast Guard. They said Trump’s ban discriminated against them based on their sex and transgender status.  In her October ruling, Kollar-Kotelly said the Trump administration’s reasons for the ban “do not appear to be supported by any facts” and cited a military-commissioned study that debunked concerns about military cohesion or healthcare costs.  A federal judge in Maryland also halted the ban in Nov. 21 ruling. ",0

"TV Viewership Falls in N.F.L. and Premier League: A Blip, or Something Worse? - The New York Times The two most successful sports leagues in the world, which bring in billions of dollars in revenue, the biggest corporate sponsors and mammoth audiences every game day, are now sharing an altogether different experience: The National Football League and the English Premier League are enduring startling,   declines in television viewership this season. Viewership through the first seven weeks of the N. F. L. season is down by 12 percent in the United States while the audiences for Premier League soccer matches this season, which began in August, are down by nearly 20 percent in Britain. The trends that drove viewers away from other programs on broadcast television in recent years, including   and DVRs, had not punished the N. F. L. and the Premier League in the same way. Fans  —   lots and lots of them  —   did not seem willing to look away. They are now, in numbers that are alarming for the leagues, which have grown used to fans’ tuning in in good times and bad, and for the networks, some of which have spent   sums for the rights to broadcast the games. Viewership for N. F. L. games on CBS on Thursday nights, on NBC on Sunday nights and on ESPN on Monday nights is down by as much as 21 percent. “We have been led to believe the N. F. L. and E. P. L. were immune to these trends, but it turns out they aren’t,” said Rick Gentile, a former CBS Sports executive producer who now runs the Seton Hall University sports poll. “This isn’t a fatal blow, but it is a   call. ” While it may be too early to fully determine whether the declines are a hiccup or a serious setback, they are large enough to prompt league executives and team owners to confront the uncomfortable possibility that their leagues have hit their peak. Publicly, the leagues contend that their businesses are fundamentally sound and that any declines in ratings have been caused by temporary factors, like the raucous presidential campaign season in the United States and the lack of a compelling story line in the Premier League, which last season got a jolt from Leicester City, the ultimate    champion. Viewing habits, the leagues say, will rebound. “We recognize that network television is still dominant, and we believe it’s going to be dominant going forward,” Roger Goodell, the N. F. L. ’s commissioner, said last week. “And it’s where the vast majority of our fans view our games. It’s a great experience, the advertising market is incredibly strong, and I think that our ratings are something that we’ll continue to look at and make sure we’re doing everything not just to get them to tune in but to get them to stay tuned in. ” Industry observers, though, point to a stew of   trends, like younger audiences’ eschewing subscription television packages in favor of free content on the internet. That could erode the leagues’ business models, which rely heavily on television networks that pay tens of billions of dollars to broadcast their games. The leagues may also be responsible for some of the slide by expanding their schedules into more days of the week, eroding the exclusivity that once made their games   TV. “Among other things, oversaturation is definitely an issue,” Mr. Gentile said. If ratings rebound later in the football and soccer seasons, as the leagues predict, the power of live, unscripted sporting events will be affirmed. But for now, the   does not feel like a blip. Recent games illustrated the N. F. L. ’s problem. On Sunday afternoon, CBS’s national broadcast of the New England Patriots’   win over the Pittsburgh Steelers attracted 21. 7 million viewers, 11 percent fewer than the comparable game in 2015. On Sunday night on NBC, 17. 7 million viewers saw a   tie between the Seattle Seahawks and the Arizona Cardinals, down 14 percent from the game played in that slot last year. Viewership for Monday night’s game on ESPN between the Denver Broncos, the defending Super Bowl champions, and the Houston Texans was down by 8 percent, slowing a   slide. Fans have tuned out the N. F. L. in previous presidential cycles, too. Dating to 1996, ratings had fallen by 2 percent to 10 percent in the games before Election Day, compared with 17 percent this time, according to N. F. L. figures. There is more at work, though. The lack of marquee matchups and the absences of stars like Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson are to blame, said Artie Bulgrin, senior vice president for global research and analytics at ESPN. “Universally, across the board,” he said, “the N. F. L. networks believe the schedules are not as strong. ” Mike Mulvihill, senior vice president for programming and research at Fox Sports, said that audiences were down not just because fans were watching fewer games but because they were watching less of the games they tuned in to. That, he said, may be a function of the elections as viewers switch to cable news channels while games are on. On Sunday afternoons this season, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC have had their audiences grow by more than a million viewers. Then there are factors that have a    impact, like the N. F. L. ’s continuing   struggles involving issues like domestic violence, brain trauma and national anthem protests. “They have largely been side issues, but even if it is a psychic toll, it’s hard to have that much of a drumbeat without their having some effect,” said Robert Boland, director of the sports administration program at Ohio University. The leagues are grappling with an even larger problem of their own making: too much football and soccer. To grab bigger audiences and more rights fees, the leagues have spread their games across more days of the week, to 9:30 a. m. starts on Sundays and Thursday night matchups in the N. F. L. and to Friday nights, as well as Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, in the Premier League. Sky Sports and BT now offer more soccer to customers than ever before, with Sky permitted to broadcast 10 Friday night Premier League games this season. BT shows a Premier League match on Saturdays, with European competition filling the schedule on alternate Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Publicly, both broadcasters say they are unconcerned by their ratings and do not believe the market is oversaturated. Sky Sports described the ratings decline as a “premature comparison,” noting that the figures did not include a number of   matches, like the showdown between Liverpool and Manchester United. Still, the numbers collated by the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board in Britain are startling  —   not only the 19 percent decline for Premier League matches but also the slide in viewership for Champions League matches, which included a 40 percent drop on one Tuesday evening. (Viewership for the Premier League in the United States, which had swelled for three years, has fallen by 17 percent on NBCSN and 18 percent on NBC.) The pressure is on because both Sky Sports and BT have made televised soccer the crucial battleground in their contest to win customers for their television, phone and internet packages. The bidding war between the companies pushed the Premier League’s rights deal for the domestic British market to 5. 134 billion pounds ($6. 279 billion) over the course of three seasons, starting this year. BT has paid an additional 937 million pounds ($1. 15 billion) for the rights to the Champions League and the Europa League, Europe’s elite competitions. The cost of the packages, though, has pushed fans to seek out illegal streaming websites and forced Premier League executives into a race to shut them down. Mike Girling, a Liverpool fan who canceled his personal Sky subscription this season, spoke for many frustrated fans. “It wasn’t value for money anymore,” he said. “I found that I was only watching Liverpool games and was paying 80 or 90 pounds a month for it. ” Mr. Girling, a pub owner, acknowledged that the “ease and proliferation” of streams for Liverpool games  —   in high definition, with English commentary  —   made them an appealing alternative when he could not attend a match being broadcast on Sky. He has even considered canceling at least one of the four subscriptions at his pubs, which cost about $1, 800 a month for each bar. “It does not bring customers in as much as it used to,” he said. “It doesn’t make economic sense anymore. ”",0
"California governor signs epinephrine bill, blasts Mylan SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday signed a bill to allow businesses across the state to carry epinephrine auto-injectors, but sharply admonished drugmaker Mylan NL over its recent price increases. Mylan has been widely criticized, including by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. The company, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of EpiPen auto-injectors to $600. The price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008. A probe into EpiPen pricing by a U.S. Senate subcommittee was announced on Sept. 7. Brown’s decision on Friday highlights the predicament facing allergy advocates, who strongly support epinephrine access legislation but have criticized Mylan’s pricing.  Over two dozen U.S. states have passed laws similar to California’s authorizing businesses to stock epinephrine, according to advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education.  Brown said he was signing the bill because EpiPens save lives, but that he strongly objected to Mylan’s pricing. “State government cannot stop unconscionable price increases, but it can shed light on such rapacious corporate behavior,” Brown said in a statement. A Mylan representative could not immediately be reached for comment. EpiPen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life-saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. Mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto-injected devices.     In response to the furor over pricing, Mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of EpiPen for $300. ",0
"On Being a Black Female Math Whiz During the Space Race - The New York Times HAMPTON, Va.  —   Growing up here in the 1970s, in the shadow of Langley Research Center, where workers helped revolutionize air flight and put Americans on the moon, Margot Lee Shetterly had a pretty fixed idea of what scientists looked like: They were middle class,   and worked at NASA, like her dad. It would be years before she learned that this was far from the American norm. And that many women in her hometown defied convention, too, by having vibrant, and by most standards, unusual careers. Black and female, dozens had worked at the space agency as mathematicians, often under Jim Crow laws, calculating crucial trajectories for rockets while being segregated from their white counterparts. For decades, as the space race made heroes out of   astronauts, the stories of those women went largely untold. Four of them are the subjects of Ms. Shetterly’s first book, “Hidden Figures,” a history being released on Tuesday by William Morrow. The book garnered an early burst of attention because its movie version, starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, is scheduled for a   release and set for an Oscars run. The movie rights were snapped up weeks after Ms. Shetterly sold her book proposal in 2014, and well before she started writing the book in earnest, a disorientingly fast, if exhilarating, turn. “The thrilling thing to me about the book, and the movie, is this is an American story that we’re getting to see through the faces of these women,” Ms. Shetterly said during a recent visit to Hampton, which sits on the southeastern end of the Virginia Peninsula, surrounded by aquamarine waters and Navy ships. “It’s just as American a story as if it were John Glenn or Alan Shepard telling it. ” Ms. Shetterly happened upon the idea for the book six years ago, when she and her husband, Aran Shetterly, then living in Mexico, were visiting her parents here. The couple and Ms. Shetterly’s father were driving around in his minivan when he mentioned, very casually, that one of Ms. Shetterly’s former Sunday school teachers had worked as a mathematician at NASA, and that another woman she knew calculated rocket trajectories for famous astronauts. Ms. Shetterly remembers her husband perking up and asking why he had never heard this tale before. “I knew women who worked at NASA as mathematicians and engineers,” Ms. Shetterly said, “but it took someone from the outside saying, ‘Wait a minute’ for me to see the story there. ” (A book on a similar topic, Nathalia Holt’s “Rise of the Rocket Girls,” about women working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the ’40s and ’50s, was published in April.) Two of the women she would focus on are still living in the area. Christine Darden, now 73 and retired, had worked her way out of NASA’s computing pool to lead engineering research into sonic booms. Katherine Johnson, who recently turned 98, lives in a retirement home with her husband of 57 years, James A. Johnson, and is enjoying a recent surge of fame. She calculated rocket trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions, and last year President Obama personally awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her life’s work. Mrs. Darden and Mrs. Johnson still socialize, and on a recent summer day, made meltingly hot by a heat wave, met to play bridge at Mrs. Johnson’s apartment. (Mrs. Johnson and her partner won.) Ms. Shetterly was visiting too, and presented both women with an early copy of her book. “Fantastic,” Mrs. Darden said, as Mrs. Johnson, whose eyesight is failing, peered at the cover with a slight smile. Yet asked how she felt about the coming film, in which she is played by Ms. Henson, in the starring role, Mrs. Johnson became solemn. (Mrs. Darden is not portrayed onscreen, as the film focuses on the years preceding her arrival at NASA.) “I shudder,” Mrs. Johnson said. She had heard, she said, that the movie might stretch the facts, and that her character possibly came across as aggressive. “I was never aggressive,” Mrs. Johnson said. Ms. Shetterly reminded Mrs. Johnson of her persistence in the late 1950s, when she successfully pressed her supervisor into admitting her into traditionally   meetings. “You took matters in your own hands,” Ms. Shetterly said. “For other women, it was a revelation. ” Ms. Johnson said: “Well, I don’t ever wait for something. I remember asking the question, ‘Is there a law?’ And he said, ‘Let her go.’ It was easier than arguing. ” Listening in, one of Mrs. Johnson’s health aides chuckled. “Yep,” he said, “That’s the Katherine Johnson I know. ” Though outwardly their stories are remarkable, both Mrs. Darden and Mrs. Johnson remained    when describing their careers, an attitude that seems to have prevailed among their peers. Ann Hammond, whose mother, Dorothy Vaughan, was one of the first black women to be hired by what was then called the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, in 1943, said her mother never wanted a pat on the back. Mrs. Vaughan died in 2005 at the age of 98, and is played in the film by Octavia Spencer. “My mother would’ve probably said, ‘I was just doing my job,’” Ms. Hammond, 80, said, speaking in the Hampton bungalow where she grew up with her five siblings. But what jobs they were. While military budget cuts and sequestration have hurt the economy here in recent decades, some 75 years ago the hungry wartime machine needed manpower, and womanpower, to fill its depleted ranks. This helped open the door for black female mathematicians, who were recruited through job bulletin boards and newspaper ads. Their job title? “Colored computers. ” Mrs. Johnson, a math savant, graduated summa cum laude from what is now West Virginia State University at 18, and heard about the job through a family connection. Mrs. Darden, who went to college at Hampton Institute and earned a master’s degree in math at Virginia State College, was hired to be a NASA data analyst out of graduate school in 1967, and went on to become an aerospace engineer. The military boom lasted for decades, allowing the women and their families to have what Ms. Hammond described as a good life, despite enduring the indignities of segregation in the early years  —   working, eating and using restrooms apart from white colleagues. Ms. Shetterly discovered in her research that the space agency’s leaders were well aware of the negative effects of segregation. As Virginia began vigorously fighting public school desegregation in 1956, one higher up worried about the face that the United States, with its roiling racial problems, was presenting to the world, using words that still have resonance today. “In trying to provide leadership in world events, it is necessary for this country to indicate to the world that we practice equality for all within this country,” NACA’s chief counsel, Paul Dembling, wrote in a file memo that year. Two years later, the segregated computing pool was disbanded. Through it all, by most accounts, the black women at NASA held their heads high. “Her whole life, my mother never felt superior and never felt less than anybody else,” said Joylette Hylick, the eldest of Mrs. Johnson’s three daughters. “She didn’t let it get in her way. ”",0
"Appeals Court Judges Explain Why Donald Trump’s Immigration Order is Legal - Breitbart The full U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Wednesday voted against rehearing the   panel decision that had affirmed a lower court’s blocking President Donald Trump’s first executive order on immigration from   nations. [Five conservative judges on the San   court dissented from that denial of an en banc rehearing, writing an opinion explaining why their court should reconsider the case.  The dissent by written by Judge Jay Bybee, who began his   dissent by stating, “Whatever we, as individuals, may feel about the President or the Executive Order, the President’s decision was well within the powers of the presidency, and the wisdom of the policy choices made by the President is not a matter for our consideration. ” Bybee quoted a 1950 Supreme Court case which declared, “The exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty. ” The dissenting judges also quoted the relevant provision of federal law, where Congress decided at 8 U. S. C. § 1182( f): Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. Bybee went on to explain that: [T]he panel made several other legal errors. Its holding that the States were likely to succeed on the merits of their procedural due process claims confound   precedent. And its unreasoned assumption that courts should simply plop Establishment Clause cases from the domestic context over to the foreign affairs context ignores the realities of our world. The Supreme Court held in 1976 that “the responsibility for regulating the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal Government. ” The political branches are elected officials in Congress and the White House. The law requires judges to “distinguish between two groups of aliens: those who are present within our borders and those who are seeking admission,” Bybee continued. The Ninth Circuit   panel acknowledged that the Supreme Court forbids courts from looking to the motivation of immigration officers when they deny an alien entry into the United States, but then held that this rule does not keep judges from determining the motivation when a president makes the same decision. That “stands the separation of powers on its head,” Bybee added. “With a moment’s thought, that principle cannot withstand the gentlest inquiry. ” Showing how the Supreme Court’s Kleindiest v. Mandel case sets forth the constitutional rule that controls this legal challenge, Bybee observed, “Compounding its omission, the panel missed all of our own cases applying Mandel to constitutional challenges to immigration decisions. ” After exploring several Supreme Court cases that all point in the same direction, the dissenting judges summarized, “When we apply the correct standard of review, the President does not have to come forward with supporting documentation to explain the basis for the Executive Order. ” “As tempting as it is to use the judicial power to balance   …     competing interests as we see fit, we cannot let our personal inclinations get ahead of important, overarching principles about who gets to make decisions in our democracy,” Bybee said. Noting that “every four years we hold a contested presidential election” in which every judge is disappointed at some point in their careers, he added that federal judges must “respect the consequences of our elections” and “trust that the wisdom of the nation as a whole will prevail in the end. ” Judge Bybee and his dissenting colleagues concluded: Above all, in a democracy, we have the duty to preserve the liberty of the people by keeping the enormous powers of the national government separated. We are judges, not Platonic Guardians. It is our duty to say what the law is, and the   of our law, the U. S. Constitution, commits the power to make foreign policy, including the decisions to permit or forbid entry into the United States, to the President and Congress. It is unlikely that the Trump administration will petition the Supreme Court to review this particular decision, which concerned only the first policy, Executive Order 13769. More likely, when one or more of the federal appeals courts hearing the challenges to the revised policy —  Executive Order 13780 —  issues their decisions on the new order, the High Court will finally weigh in, unless the   policy has expired by that point.

"Trump endorses Romney niece Ronna Romney McDaniel for RNC chair NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday endorsed a niece of former critic Mitt Romney to be the next chair of the Republican National Committee as he moved to put his stamp on the party leadership. The RNC named Michigan Republican Party chair Ronna Romney McDaniel as its deputy chair, and Trump said he looked forward to her taking over the party leadership. Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, will leave the RNC chairmanship when Trump takes office on Jan. 20. “I’m excited to have a highly effective leader in Ronna McDaniel as RNC deputy chair and I look forward to her serving as the party’s chairman in 2017,” Trump said in a statement. “Ronna has been extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in Michigan, and I know she will bring the same passion to the Republican National Committee,” he added. The RNC’s 168 elected members will convene in January to elect their next chairman and Trump’s endorsement of McDaniel will likely carry enough weight to get her elected. McDaniel’s profile rose in Trump’s view when she helped him win Michigan in the Nov. 8 election. The state had not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988 and was critical to Trump’s victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Her selection came two days after Trump passed over Mitt Romney to be his secretary of state, instead choosing Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson. Trump and Romney have gotten past their frictions during the Republican presidential nominating battle when the 2012 Republican nominee was critical of Trump’s candidacy. Bob Paduchik, a veteran Republican operative in Ohio who was Trump’s campaign manager in that state, was named deputy co-chair of the RNC. Trump’s victory in Ohio was also crucial to his victory. ",0

"Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin to Separate After His Latest Sexting Scandal - The New York Times It was supposed to be a quiet,   weekend on the exclusive shores of the Hamptons. But on Sunday, Huma Abedin, the closest aide to Hillary Clinton, received devastating news. After accompanying Mrs. Clinton to   Ms. Abedin learned from her husband, Anthony D. Weiner, that The New York Post was about to report that he had again exchanged lewd messages with a woman on social media: the sort of behavior that destroyed his congressional career and 2013 mayoral campaign. Only this time, the online indiscretions included an image of Mr. Weiner’s crotch as he lay next to the couple’s    son. Now, Mr. Weiner’s tawdry activities may have claimed his marriage  —   Ms. Abedin told him that she wanted to separate  —   and have cast another shadow on the adviser and confidante who has been by Mrs. Clinton’s side for the past two decades. Ms. Abedin was already a major figure this summer in controversies over Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information as secretary of state and over ties between the Clinton family foundation and Mrs. Clinton’s State Department. Mr. Weiner’s extramarital behavior also threatens to remind voters about the troubles in the Clintons’ own marriage over the decades, including Mrs. Clinton’s   decision to remain with   Bill Clinton after revelations of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Ms. Abedin’s choice to separate from her husband evokes the debates that erupted over Mrs. Clinton’s handling of the Lewinsky affair, a scandal her campaign wants left in the past. Clinton advisers expressed only sympathy for Ms. Abedin on Monday and said they were confident Mr. Weiner’s actions would not hurt Mrs. Clinton, who learned about them from Ms. Abedin and offered support. But Mr. Weiner’s behavior quickly became fodder for Donald J. Trump, Mrs. Clinton’s Republican opponent in the presidential race. “Huma is making a very wise decision,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him. ” He then went further, claiming that the marriage’s breakdown was a matter of national security. Mrs. Clinton received her first intelligence briefing as the Democratic presidential nominee on Saturday at the F. B. I. field office in White Plains. No aides accompanied her to the briefing, according to a campaign official. “I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,” Mr. Trump said, using language that echoed criticism of Mrs. Clinton this summer by the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey Jr. “Who knows what he learned and who he told? It’s just another example of Hillary Clinton’s bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this. ” A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks. The spotlight on Ms. Abedin and her proximity to Mrs. Clinton has been an increasing distraction for the campaign. Several of Ms. Abedin’s emails on Mrs. Clinton’s private server have drawn scrutiny amid accusations that donors to the Clinton Foundation received special access to the State Department. And political opponents, including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, have questioned Ms. Abedin’s arrangement to earn income privately while she worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department. In addition to being on Mrs. Clinton’s personal payroll, Ms. Abedin received money from the Clinton Foundation and Teneo, a consulting firm founded in part by Douglas J. Band, previously a senior aide to Mr. Clinton. Ms. Abedin, 40, has been at Mrs. Clinton’s side since she was an intern to the first lady in the 1990s. Now vice chairwoman of the Clinton campaign, Ms. Abedin, often described as a surrogate daughter, occupies an almost singular role as a trusted, and visible, confidante to Mrs. Clinton. Their lives took similar tracks, as both women, citing their religious beliefs, seemed determined to remain married despite their husbands’ sexual proclivities. Mrs. Clinton strongly supported Ms. Abedin when Mr. Weiner’s sexually charged text messages came to light in 2011, a year into their marriage, and again in 2013, when Mr. Weiner was running for mayor of New York. Friends of Mrs. Clinton said that she had spoken to Ms. Abedin at length about the marriage and that she supported Ms. Abedin’s decision to remain with Mr. Weiner and work on their relationship. The couple’s marital problems have been a subject of years of tabloid mockery and humiliation since Mr. Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 amid revelations that he had sent sexual images of himself to women on social media. His 2013 campaign for mayor was damaged, too, when Mr. Weiner admitted that he had continued flirting with women online. By Monday morning, when the Post cover showing Mr. Weiner and his son, Jordan, hit newsstands, Mr. Weiner had left the Hamptons for New York City aware that Ms. Abedin planned to announce their separation, said two people close to the couple who discussed private conversations on the condition of anonymity. “After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,” Ms. Abedin said in a statement. “Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy. ” In the latest issue of Vogue, Ms. Abedin portrayed Mr. Weiner as a devoted father and their marriage as a true partnership. “Many working moms feel this way  —   there is a lot of guilt,” she said. “I don’t think I could do it if I didn’t have the full support system I have, if Anthony wasn’t willing to be, essentially, a   dad. ” But the two people close to the couple said Ms. Abedin and Mr. Weiner had been growing apart for some time, with Ms. Abedin often on the campaign trail with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Weiner at home with Jordan. They said the Post article had not caused a sudden and unexpected rupture to a happy marriage, but rather was the final catalyst for Ms. Abedin to move for a separation. Campaign officials had braced for new revelations about Mr. Weiner after The Post reported this month that a Republican had baited Mr. Weiner into a flirtatious online chat. Asked by The New York Times this month whether he was still engaging in the behavior that had foiled his political career, Mr. Weiner said, “I’m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that. ” Mrs. Clinton had hoped to ride out the final week of August with limited distractions as she seeks to maintain her solid lead in national polls. On Monday, she attended three   in the Hamptons, without Ms. Abedin, and spoke briefly on a conference call with policy experts and medical providers to unveil her proposals on mental health. “We’ve got to make clear mental health is not a personal failing,” Mrs. Clinton said. Aides said that Ms. Abedin’s marriage was a private matter and that her decision to announce the separation meant the frenetic news cycle would soon move on. “The best way to get rid of a problem is to get rid of a problem,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant. “The end of that marriage publicly announced makes it impossible for Anthony Weiner to have anything to do with the campaign. ” But unlike many political aides, Ms. Abedin has become a public figure in her own right, posing for Vogue, snapping selfies with voters on the rope line at Mrs. Clinton’s campaign events and hosting her own   on her boss’s behalf. Hours after Ms. Abedin released her statement, Showtime blasted out a news release announcing the October television debut of “Weiner,” an unfettered documentary about the implosion of Mr. Weiner’s mayoral campaign and the couple’s interactions after his second scandal. In the messages reported by The Post, Mr. Weiner exchanged photos with a woman. She appeared in various bikinis, and Mr. Weiner was   showing off his stomach or his groin  —   and they talked about sex. In one message, Mr. Weiner abruptly changed the discussion from massage parlors and reportedly wrote, “Someone just climbed into my bed. ” “Really?” the woman replied. His response, in a screen shot dated July 31, 2015, showed a child curled up next to Mr. Weiner, who was wearing only white briefs.",0

"U.S.-led coalition says Islamic State Syria convoy split in two BEIRUT (Reuters) - An Islamic State evacuation convoy trying to reach IS territory in east Syria has split in two, with some buses remaining in the open desert after others turned back into government-held areas, a U.S.-led coalition fighting the group said on Sunday.  The Syrian government and Lebanon s Hezbollah group offered the convoy of about 300 lightly armed fighters and about 300 family members safe passage a week ago in return for Islamic State surrendering an enclave on the Syria-Lebanon border.  However, the coalition has blocked the convoy from entering Islamic State territory in east Syria, near the border with Iraq, by cratering roads and destroying bridges, saying it opposes the evacuation deal as being  not a lasting solution .   One group remains in the open desert to the north west of Al-Bukamal and the other group has headed west towards Palmyra,  the coalition said in an emailed statement. On Saturday Hezbollah said all but six of the buses had safely crossed out of Syrian government territory and were no longer the responsibility of it or the Syrian government. It warned the United States that the buses in the desert included elderly people, pregnant women and casualties, and accused it of stopping humanitarian aid reaching the convoy. The coalition said it had contacted Russia to deliver a message to the Syrian government that it would still not let the convoy pass, and that it had offered suggestions on how to save the civilians in it from suffering.   Food and water have been provided to the convoy,  it said, without giving further details.  The coalition has said it will not target the convoy directly while it contains civilians, but said in its statement it had struck about 85 IS fighters near the convoy.  It had also struck about 40 IS vehicles near the convoy including a tank, an artillery system, armed vehicles and transport vehicles seeking to help move the fighters in the convoy into its territory, it said.

"Iraq Votes to Ban Americans in Response to Trump’s Immigration Order - Breitbart Iraq’s lawmakers have voted in favor of a reciprocal travel ban on U. S. citizens if President Donald Trump’s administration does not rescind its decision to prohibit the entry of Iraqis. [When Barack Obama blocked Iraqi refugees from entering the United States for six months in 2011, the   parliament took no action.  On Monday, Iraqi lawmakers voted to call on the   Baghdad government to “respond in kind to the American decision in the event that the American side does not to withdraw its decision,” reports Agence   (AFP) citing Iraqi member of parliament (MP) Hakim   who quoted the text of the decision that was read during the parliamentary session. “Parliament voted by majority on calling on the Iraqi government and the foreign ministry to respond in kind,” declared MP Zamili. Iraqi MP Sadiq   reportedly confirmed that “the vote was for a call on the government” to enact a reciprocal ban. Al Jazeera points out, “The [Iraqi parliament] vote on Monday is not thought to be binding on the government of Prime Minister Haider   whose government has made no official comment on the order. ” Haider’s foreign ministry has urged the Trump administration to review the ban. The recent vote by Iraqi lawmakers came in response to President Trump’s executive order to ban citizens traveling on passports from seven   nations  —   Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen  —   from entering the United States for at least 90 days in an effort to strengthen America’s refugee vetting process. “Importantly, however, Lawful Permanent Residents of the United States [green card holders]  …     will be allowed to board U. S. bound aircraft and will be assessed for exceptions at arrival ports of entry, as appropriate. The entry of these individuals, subject to national security checks, is in the national interest,” notes the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in explaining the executive order, which President Trump signed on Friday. The executive order also allows the U. S. government to “prioritize refugee claims” from members of persecuted religious minorities in the predominantly Muslim countries covered under the ban, such as Christians and Yazidis. In 2011,   Obama instituted a similar ban, although it is unclear if it included the religious minority exception. There were neither protests nor backlash from the mainstream media in response to Obama’s measure. A 2013 article by ABC News, titled “Exclusive: US May Have Let ‘Dozens’ of Terrorists Into Country As Refugees,” revealed: As a result of the Kentucky case, the [Obama] State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News  —   even for many who had heroically helped U. S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets. One Iraqi who had aided American troops was assassinated before his refugee application could be processed, because of the immigration delays, two U. S. officials said. In 2011, fewer than 10, 000 Iraqis were resettled as refugees in the U. S. half the number from the year before, State Department statistics show. The Kentucky case refers to the discovery in 2009 of two   Iraqi terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green who ultimately admitted in court that they had attacked U. S. soldiers in Iraq. One of those terrorists, Waad Ramadan Alwan, entered the United States through Syria. Moreover, the seven nations covered by the order, including Iraq, had been previously identified as “countries of concern” under the Obama administration. “These seven countries were designated by Congress and the Obama Administration as posing a significant enough security risk to warrant additional scrutiny in the visa waiver context,” notes DHS. Unlike President Trump, Obama failed to announce his temporary ban on Iraqi refugees, which the leftist mainstream media has interpreted as meaning that it was not the former president’s policy to temporarily halt the entry of Iraqi refugees because he never took ownership of the measure. The recent Iraqi parliament vote echoes calls from Iran for a reciprocal travel ban on American citizens. According to the Independent, the   Shiite militia coalition dubbed the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) also known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and Hashd   has also been critical of Trump’s national security policy, “calling for a ban on issuing visas to Americans visiting the country and for those already in Iraq to be expelled. ” Shiite powerhouse Iran has also vowed to implement legal, political, and reciprocal measures in response to the U. S. policy, announced the Islamic Republic’s Foreign Affairs Ministry on Saturday. The   Baghdad government is close to Iran. “We are against this stance from the new administration,” said Iraqi MP Laban, referring to Trump’s national security order, adding, “We hope that the American administration will rethink  …     this decision. ”",0
"Former Prime Minister Is Elected President of Struggling Somalia - The New York Times A man everyone calls Cheese won Somalia’s presidency on Wednesday, and the streets of the beleaguered capital, Mogadishu, exploded in cheers. Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a former prime minister, was chosen for the top job, capping a   electoral process that had been widely criticized as corrupt even by Somali politicians who participated in it. Mr. Mohamed, better known in Somalia by his nickname, Farmajo (from formaggio, the Italian word for cheese, for which his father was said to have acquired a taste when Somalia was an Italian colony) was considered the protest candidate and less manipulated by foreign interests than the departing president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Mr. Mohamed enjoys wide support within Somalia’s army. The moment his victory was announced, celebratory gunfire rang out in Mogadishu as soldiers across the city sprayed bullets into the sky. Mr. Mohamed is rare on the Somali political scene for one reason: He is popular. Crowds of ordinary people poured into Mogadishu’s streets to cheer and whistle on Wednesday night. As one Somalia analyst put it: The least corrupt and    candidate won Somalia’s most corrupt and least democratic election. Go figure. Somalia, which has lurched from crisis to crisis since the central government collapsed in 1991, did not hold direct elections. Instead, Western donors helped set up a complicated indirect election in which Somalia’s regions and its myriad clans, subclans and subsubclans chose 329 members of Parliament, and those members of Parliament then voted for a president. Western officials thought it too dangerous to hold direct elections because of the persistent threat from the Shabab militant group, which has killed thousands across East Africa. On Tuesday, the Shabab fired mortar rounds into the area in Mogadishu where the election was being held. Mr. Mohamud, the incumbent, handily won the first round of voting, leading Mr. Mohamed by 88 to 72 votes in a field of more than 20 candidates. Many analysts said that Mr. Mohamud had built a huge war chest by receiving secret payments from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries, and that he used that money to line up votes ahead of time in Parliament. Many analysts considered it his election to lose. But Mr. Mohamed seems to have tapped into growing resentment about corruption, or possibly, some analysts said, he had his own ways to win over lawmakers. In the last few years, Somali government officials have been steadily enriching themselves, analysts said, while much of the population has sunk deeper into poverty. Aid workers are now worried that millions of Somalis will soon face a famine it would be the third one in 25 years. In the second round of voting, the other presidential contenders threw their weight behind Mr. Mohamed. He won, 184 to 97. Western diplomats quietly cheered on Mr. Mohamed, seeing him as the most organized  —   and least crooked  —   of the contenders. But just about everyone agrees that Somalia still has a long way to go. The government provides few services and controls only small slices of territory. The only reason it controls any territory is the presence of thousands of African Union peacekeepers who have been battling the Shabab for years, taking heavy casualties. Mr. Mohamed, who was born in 1962, had a good reputation as prime minister. As soon as he took office in 2010, he set up a payroll system for soldiers, shrank a bloated cabinet and spoke out against corruption, even though graft continued to blossom on his watch. When he was pushed out less than a year later, as part of a bitter power struggle within the government, protests exploded. Before entering politics, Mr. Mohamed worked as a diplomat for the Somali government and later for the New York State Department of Transportation in Buffalo. He holds American and Somali citizenship, and when he returned to his cubicle in Buffalo after his short stint as prime minister, his   baked him a cake.",0
"After a terrible week Trump sticks with style over substance in Wisconsin Having just spent an hour on Sunday evening watching Donald Trump in a town hall setting with Fox's Greta Van Susteren moderating from Madison, Wisconsin, I am left with one impression: I don't want to buy a car from this guy.

I have no idea what the final outcome of this nomination battle will be -- or whether Trump can be elected president of the United States -- but I do know this, he can dance and he's one hell of a salesman.

After having experienced , for him, probably the worst week of this election cycle, I was curious if he would clean up or restate some of his controversial statements on abortion ( 4 different answers in a week), his dismissal of NATO and the United Nations, his comments suggesting Japan and South Korea might need to arm themselves with nuclear weapons  and -- along with Saudi Arabia -- pay the U.S. a lot more money for our services because they are all rich and we are $20 trillion dollars in debt.  Yes, it’s true, the United States is not the policeman of the world or nor should we be. Trump also didn't add any details for his plan to pay off the debt in 8 years by not raising taxes. He didn't restate or make any of it clearer.

It was an hour of performance -- not substance -- and certainly not anything different from what we've heard him say in various debates or in the hundreds of hours he has performed on television.

He's gonna repeal ObamaCare and put in a system of many options (not defined or explained ) that will be better, less expensive and everybody will be covered and everyone will be happy with their coverage.  And no one’s going to die in the streets.

Taxes are going to be lower for everyone but the rich hedge fund guys who aren't paying their fair share. (OK, I agree with him on that one.)

He's going to renegotiate all the bad trade deals starting with the most recent Iran deal. (Again, I agree with that one.) And he’s also going to bring all the jobs home from China and Mexico and any other countries that have stolen our them. Of course, I’m not quite sure how this is going to work because there were no details provided in his answers.

He's going to knock out ISIS, stop airline mergers, fix the college education program because costs are too high and kids are being ripped off.

He's gonna stop the drug epidemic in New Hampshire because they are good people and gave him his first real victory. He did give details on this one.

He going to make one call into Mexico to someone (I assume to Enrique Peña Nieto who is the 57th president of Mexico. He's also the guy to talk to about paying for the $10 billion fence) and tell him to cut off the drugs or else.

If you missed the hour on Sunday night don't worry you because you will see a similar version of the Donald Trump show again and the sound bites will be the same.

Trump has said that one of his heroes is the great heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali who, at the end of his career, invented the ""Rope a Dope"" to keep from getting hit and to wear out his opponents by evading their punches.

Donald Trump has perfected his own version of ""Rope a Dope"" -- keep talking and avoid specifics.

Now, about that used car. Don't worry, it will be the greatest and it will be the cheapest and best looking and I will be very happy.

Unfortunately, for Trump on Sunday night while he was ""Rope a Doping"" in Madison, the Cruz team was kicking his tail in North Dakota and picked up at least 18 of the 25 delegates who are either supporting Cruz or are against Trump.

The long fight for the Republican nomination is a long way from finished and Donald Trump is still marching on.

Cruz is running a great grass root campaign and Trump is running a great marketing effort. He is the product and he is the number one salesman.

Edward J. Rollins is a Fox News contributor. He is a former assistant to President Reagan and he managed his reelection campaign. He is a senior presidential fellow at Hofstra University and a member of the Political Consultants Hall of Fame. He is a strategist for Great America PAC, an independant group that is supporting Donald Trump for president.",0
"Obama Immigration Plan Seems to Divide Supreme Court - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court on Monday seemed sharply divided during an extended argument over a challenge to President Obama’s plan that would shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally. A   deadlock seemed a real possibility, one that would leave in place an appeals court ruling that blocks the plan and deny Mr. Obama the chance to revive it while he remains in office. A tie vote would set no Supreme Court precedent and therefore would allow a renewed challenge to the plan once the court is back at full strength. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’s questions were deeply skeptical of the administration’s position. They appeared to signal that he would not join the court’s four more liberal members in dismissing the case on the ground that the challengers had not suffered injuries giving them standing to sue. A ruling based on standing would be a victory for the administration. The case, brought by Texas and 25 other states, could still produce a significant ruling on presidential power and immigration policy in the midst of an election campaign in which both issues have been prominent. A loss for Mr. Obama would vindicate Republican accusations that he has acted lawlessly in exceeding the limits of presidential power and has not done enough to secure the nation’s borders. A victory for him would uphold one of the central legacies of his presidency and affect the lives of countless immigrants. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. the government’s top appellate lawyer, opened the arguments with a vigorous defense of Mr. Obama’s authority to set priorities for immigration enforcement. He was quickly challenged by Chief Justice Roberts. “Could the president grant deferred removal to every unlawfully present alien in the United States right now?” the chief justice asked skeptically. Mr. Verrilli said there were statutory constraints that would prevent the president from doing so. Mr. Verrilli also argued that Texas had not suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue. The chief justice said the administration had given Texas an impossible choice, “a real  . ” Texas says it has standing to sue because it would be costly for the state to give driver’s licenses to immigrants affected by the federal policy. Mr. Verrilli said the state could simply change its law to deny driver’s licenses to the immigrants. “You would sue them instantly,” Chief Justice Roberts responded, meaning that the federal government would file a lawsuit challenging Texas’ unequal treatment of immigrants affected by the program. Mr. Verrilli said that was probably so but that such a suit might not succeed. The answer did not seem to satisfy Chief Justice Roberts, who suggested that the choice between incurring a budget shortfall and facing a lawsuit from the federal government was enough to establish standing. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, on the other hand, twice suggested that Texas could have filed a different kind of lawsuit, one in which its standing would not be in question. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that “nearly 11 million unauthorized aliens are here in the shadows. ” “They’re here whether we want them or not,” she said. But Justice Kennedy questioned whether the president can defer deportations for millions of people without specific congressional authorization. “It’s as if the president is defining the policy and the Congress is executing it,” Justice Kennedy said. “That’s just upside down. ” The case, United States v. Texas, No.   concerns a program intended to allow more than four million unauthorized immigrants who are the parents of citizens or of lawful permanent residents to apply for a program sparing them from deportation and providing them work permits. The program, announced in November 2014, was called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA. Mr. Verrilli told the justices that it addressed “a pressing humanitarian concern in avoiding the breakup of families that contain U. S. citizen children. ” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked if the president could simply open the nation’s borders. Mr. Verrilli said that was “a million miles from where we are now. ” That comment prompted Justice Kennedy to jump in. “Well, it’s four million people from where we are now,” he said, referring to the number of immigrants affected by Mr. Obama’s plan. “What we’re doing is defining the limits of discretion,” Justice Kennedy said of the court’s role in determining the lawfulness of the plan. “And it seems to me that that is a legislative, not an executive act. ” Scott A. Keller, Texas’ solicitor general, said Mr. Obama’s plan was unprecedented and unlawful. He faced skeptical questions from the court’s more liberal members about whether his state had standing. Justice Sotomayor wondered why it would cost more to issue more driver’s licenses. “Why can’t you just let people wait on line?” she asked. A different line, for one of the coveted red tickets that allow members of the public into the Supreme Court for the oral arguments, stretched around the block on Monday. Some people had been camping in front of the court since Friday night, eager for a chance to witness history. Groups of young people walked up and down the sidewalk holding banners and chanting mantras like “Sí se puede,” Spanish for “Yes we can. ” Thomas Pittman, a retired firefighter and a deacon at Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton, said he was interested in the effects the case might have on the presidential race. “I think it’s going to have a major impact on the election, due to the fact that Trump wants to deport people and close our borders down,” he said, referring to the Republican   Donald J. Trump. Mr. Obama has said he took action after years of frustration with Republicans in Congress who had repeatedly refused to support bipartisan Senate legislation to update immigration laws. A coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, promptly challenged the plan, accusing the president of ignoring administrative procedures for changing rules and of abusing the power of his office by sidestepping Congress. If the Supreme Court upholds Mr. Obama’s actions, the White House has vowed to move quickly to set up the program and begin enrolling immigrants before his successor takes over early next year. Democratic presidential candidates have said they would continue the program, but most of the Republicans in the race have vowed to dismantle it and redouble immigration enforcement. Mr. Keller, Texas’ lawyer, acknowledged that the president has wide authority over whom to deport. “In this case,” he said, “given that they are removing 400, 000 people a year, we admit that they could do forbearance from removal. But what they can’t do is grant authorization to be in the country. ” He said the states’ quarrel was with what he called a blanket grant of “lawful presence” to millions of immigrants, entitling them to various benefits. Mr. Verrilli, the administration’s lawyer, said the term “lawful presence” had been misunderstood. Chief Justice Roberts asked him whether he was slicing things a little too fine. “Lawfully present does not mean you’re legally present?” the chief justice asked. “Correct,” Mr. Verrilli responded. Justice Alito said that response was mystifying. “I’m just talking about the English language,” he said. “I just don’t understand it. ” But Justice Elena Kagan said the term “lawful presence” was a red herring, suggesting that the administration could “have done the exact same thing without using that phrase. ”",0

"U.S. Supreme Court to decide major case on Obama immigration plan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday paved the way for a major ruling on the limits of presidential powers, agreeing to decide the legality of President Barack Obama’s unilateral action to shield more than 4 million illegal immigrants from deportation. The court agreed to hear Obama’s bid to resurrect his plan, undertaken in 2014 through executive action bypassing the Republican-led Congress, that was blocked last year by lower courts after Texas and 25 other Republican-governed states sued to stop it. A ruling is due by the end of June. The case is not the first time Obama has asked the Supreme Court to rescue a major initiative. The court in 2012 and 2015 rejected conservative challenges to his signature healthcare law. The White House expressed confidence the court would now deem as lawful Obama’s immigration action, which was crafted to let millions of illegal immigrants whose children are American citizens or lawful permanent residents to get into a program that protects them from deportation and supplies work permits. Texas and the other states contend Obama exceeded his presidential powers and usurped the authority of Congress. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said courts have long recognized the limits to presidential authority. “The court should affirm what President Obama said himself on more than 20 occasions: that he cannot unilaterally rewrite congressional laws and circumvent the people’s representatives,” Paxton said. The nine justices will review a November ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld a February 2015 decision by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, a city along the Texas border with Mexico, to halt Obama’s action. With some of his major legislative initiatives suffocated by Republican lawmakers, the Democratic president has resorted to executive action to get around Congress on issues including immigration, gun control and the Obamacare law. The most recent executive action came this month when he acted unilaterally to expand background checks for certain gun purchases. His executive actions have antagonized Republicans who accuse him of unlawfully taking actions by executive fiat that only Congress can perform. The case raises several legal issues, including whether states have legal standing to sue the U.S. government over decisions on how to enforce federal laws. The high court added a separate question on whether the president’s action violated a provision of the U.S. Constitution that requires the president to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” The Obama administration called the president’s action mere guidance to immigration officials on how to exercise discretion given by Congress on how to enforce immigration laws. Obama’s action was “consistent with the actions taken by presidents of both parties, the laws passed by Congress and the decisions of the Supreme Court,” White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said. Those eligible for Obama’s program, directed at illegal immigrants with no criminal record, would be able to work legally and receive some federal benefits. States were not required to provide any benefits. His order expanded on a 2012 program that provided similar relief for people who became illegal immigrants as children. The case could have repercussions beyond immigration because it would set a precedent for the circumstances under which states can sue the federal government over a range of executive actions. Future presidents, Republican or Democratic, could face new constraints if the states win. The case is one of the most important the Supreme Court will decide during its current term, along with a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law. If the court sides with Obama, he would have until his term ends in January 2017 to implement the immigration plan. With the U.S. presidential election looming in November, it would be up to the next president to decide whether to keep it in place. Obama’s action came after a bipartisan immigration policy overhaul bill passed by the Senate died in the House of Representatives. The immigration issue has driven a wedge between Hispanics, an increasingly important voting bloc, and Republicans, many of whom have offered tough words about illegal immigrants. Most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants are Hispanics, coming from Mexico and other Latin American countries. The ruling is due just months before the presidential election. The two leading Democratic presidential hopefuls, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, said on Tuesday the court should uphold Obama’s action. Republican candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio said as president they would undo Obama’s immigration moves. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Obama’s executive action relied on well-established constitutional authority. He said he recently met with the illegal immigrant parents of U.S citizens and lawful permanent residents, saying that “these law-abiding men and women continue to live in constant fear of being separated from their children. These families must be allowed to step out of the shadows and fully contribute to the country that they love and call home.” ",0
"GAO to examine panel on foreign investment in U.S. strategic firms WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The investigative arm of Congress has agreed to examine whether a panel that oversees foreign investment in the United States has the legal powers it needs to keep up with efforts by state-owned firms in Russia and China to buy strategic U.S. companies. The Government Accountability Office said in a letter to lawmakers released on Monday that it would begin the review in about four months once the staff with the needed expertise were cleared of other duties. The letter was dated Sept. 30. The study is being initiated in response to a request on Sept. 15 by 16 members of Congress, who voiced concern that legislation governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has not been updated enough to ensure the panel can do its job effectively. “Now is an opportune time for GAO to review what has worked well, and where CFIUS authorities may need to be expanded, especially given the rise in state-owned enterprises and state-controlled enterprises from China and Russia, among other designated countries,” the lawmakers said in their letter. The letter from the lawmakers noted that foreign investment oversight began as an executive order from the president and was only codified by Congress in response to concerns about foreign ownership of defense industries and ports. The letter said lawmakers were now concerned about recent investments in the telecommunications, media and agriculture sectors that raised questions about “the degree to which foreign ownership ... may pose a strategic rather than overt national security threat.” It noted that Chinese companies designated by Beijing as “state champions” often benefited from illegal subsidies in order to gain strategic access to markets like the United States. The letter said Congress had raised concerns about China National Chemical Corp’s (ChemChina) CNNCC.UL planned $43 billion acquisition of Swiss agricultural seed and pesticides provider Syngenta AG SYNN.S and to Dalian Wanda Group’s bid for major American movie studios like Legendary Entertainment and Paramount Studios. It said the media acquisitions were particularly concerning because of “China’s efforts to censor topics and exert propaganda controls on American media.” “These examples raise serious security questions about what authority CFIUS currently has, or may need to be added, to address these concerns,” the lawmakers said in their letter.

"Angry and inspired: Democrats train new wave of candidates ROCKVILLE, Md. (Reuters) - The 100 Democratic women who packed into a suburban Maryland conference room recently for a one-day training on how to run for political office were more than activists eager to battle President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans. The teachers, students and business leaders were also a window into the future for a Democratic Party desperate for new blood, and into the booming effort to turn the left’s grassroots anti-Trump activism into a new wave of Democratic officeholders. As thousands of potential first-time candidates explore  political bids in what Democratic veterans say is an unprecedented surge of activity, a broad but informal network of groups is beefing up efforts to train them for the task. The goal: turning neophytes into successful politicians who can win, giving the party a deep and diverse bench of up-and-coming progressive talent at all levels of government. “This era of Trump has made everybody just want to run for office, and it’s not easy,” said Josh Morrow, executive director of 314 Action, which since its founding last year has heard from about 6,000 scientists, engineers and mathematicians exploring  political runs and trained nearly 500 of them. “No matter how accomplished people are, they need help when they first run,” Morrow said. The surge of interest has given dispirited Democrats, long criticized as a top-heavy party lacking fresh faces, hope for a renaissance at the local and state levels after repeated setbacks under President Barack Obama. Building from the ground up, from the school board to the statehouse, is a party priority after losing nearly 1,000 state legislative seats in the last eight years. Republicans also control the White House, both chambers of Congress and 33 governor’s offices, the most in nearly a century. “Local offices matter, and as Democrats we have sort of forgotten that,” said Amanda Litman, a staffer on Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign who founded the group Run for Something after the 2016 election to recruit and prepare millennials for office. For first-timers, the initial enthusiasm for public service can quickly give way to worried questions about the logistics of building a fundraising list, utilizing social media and crafting a message. “I knew I had a steep learning curve,” said Thereasa Black, a lawyer and Navy veteran running for the U.S. Congress from Maryland. She attended the Rockville session run by Emerge America, which prepares women for office. “This is a way to find people who are like-minded and going through what you are, and can help you,” she said. A Republican spokesman said Democrats would need more than training and fresh faces to gain ground in next year’s midterm elections given the losses of first-time Democratic candidates in special congressional races in Georgia and Montana earlier this year. “The challenges that Democrats face go much deeper and come down to fundraising and messaging,” said Rick Gorka, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, which sponsored a training program for about 4,500 volunteer field staff and operatives last year. Geoffrey Dittberner, 30, said he had volunteered on campaigns before deciding to run for the Minnesota legislature, but he was still unprepared for being a candidate before he was accepted into Run for Something’s training program. “There were so many things I didn’t know - fundraising, setting up a campaign organization - but they made it pretty easy,” he said. The group’s Slack application gave him access to a variety of resources, from tutorials to mentors and peer networks, discussion groups and on-call experts, he said. Aside from new groups like 314 Action and Run for Something, about a dozen established organizations that have long offered training to progressive candidates also have been flooded with interest since Trump’s election. Emily’s List, which for years has trained women candidates who favor abortion rights, has hired five more staffers this year for a reconstituted training unit. It already has heard from 16,000 women interested in becoming candidates this year, compared to 920 in 2016. Emerge America has seen applications jump by 87 percent and added five new state chapters. The Maryland state chapter, which ran the one-day course in Rockville, had trained 250 women by mid-year. Last year, it trained 55. At Emerge’s Rockville session, candidates were encouraged to listen more than they talk and delve into their own experiences to explain what motivated them to run. “When we tap into our own personal story, we relate better to people in our community,” Diane Fink, executive director for Emerge Maryland, told the class. She asked them to put together a three-minute story that explains how they got started. While Democrats nationally have battled over their core message, most of the training programs say they avoid telling candidates specifically what issues to emphasize. “First and foremost you should be talking about what matters to voters, not to you,” said veteran Democratic strategist Kelly Dietrich, who founded the National Democratic Training Committee last year to offer free online training for any Democrat running for any office. So far, more than 6,000 have signed up. ",0
"India calls Rohingya refugees 'threat to national security' NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government on Thursday told the Supreme Court that Rohingya refugees were  a threat to national security , pushing back against condemnation of its plans to deport them.  India s top court is hearing a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government s decision to deport Rohingya Muslims, filed by two Rohingyas living in Delhi who fled their village in Myanmar s western Rakhine State about six years ago. The decision to deport Rohingyas comes as Myanmar s military crackdown in Rakhine has forced hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas to seek shelter in Bangladesh, in a process the U.N. has described as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar says its forces are carrying out their legitimate duty to restore order after guerrilla attacks on Aug. 25 on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed. Close to 40,000 Rohingya Muslims live in India after fleeing Myanmar over the past decade. Nearly 15,000 have received refugee documentation, according to the United Nations, but India wants to deport them all. Rohingyas are denied citizenship in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. Some groups allied to Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party have stepped up calls for Rohingyas to leave, and Modi said last week that India shared Myanmar s concerns about  extremist violence  in Rakhine state.  On Thursday, a senior lawyer representing India s government told the supreme court that  the state considers that Rohingyas are a threat to national security.  Intelligence agencies suspect that Rohingya Muslim leaders in India are in touch with Pakistan-based militant groups, the lawyer said. The lawyer declined to be named because an affidavit the home ministry is preparing to file with the court has not yet been finalised. Bangladesh is also growing hostile to the Rohingya, more than 400,000 of whom live there after fleeing Myanmar since the early 1990s. From Bangladesh, some Rohingyas have crossed into India. Aid groups and human rights activists have criticized the plans to expel Rohingyas, and some lawyers say deportation would violate India s constitution. India s supreme court is expected to start hearing the case on Monday.  India this week sent 53 tonnes of relief materials to Bangladesh for Rohingyas fleeing Myanmar. ",0
"U.S. Senate moves Jeff Sessions toward confirmation as attorney general WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday, in a procedural vote, cleared the way for confirming President Donald Trump’s nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general. By a vote of 52-47, the Republican-controlled Senate agreed to limit debate on Sessions. A final vote on confirming him to head the Justice Department, the nation’s top law enforcement job, is likely sometime this week. Sessions, as is the custom for senators voting on their own nominations, cast a vote of “present.” ",0
"Turkey says Gulen network behind U.S. case against Turkish trader ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The U.S. case against a Turkish gold trader accused of evading U.S. sanctions on Iran is based on evidence fabricated by the network of the Muslim cleric Ankara blames for last year s coup attempt, Turkey s foreign minister said on Friday. Mevlut Cavusoglu said the case against the trader, Reza Zarrab, showed the extent to which followers of the U.S.-based cleric, Fethullah Gulen, had infiltrated American state institutions, including its judiciary and overseas missions. The Zarrab case has complicated already strained relations between the United States and Turkey, both members of the NATO military alliance. U.S. prosecutors have charged the wealthy Iranian-born Zarrab and his alleged co-conspirators of handling hundreds of millions of dollars for Iran s government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015, in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions. While nine people have been criminally charged, only Zarrab and a banker from Turkey s Halkbank, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, are in U.S. custody. Both are due to go on trial on Nov. 27, and have pleaded not guilty.  When you look at the indictment of Mr Zarrab it is exactly the same one that FETO actually prepared here in Turkey in 2013,  Cavusoglu told reporters at a briefing in Istanbul, using the government s term for Gulen s network.   So this case is very much a FETO-motivated one, this is for sure. All those indictments and files they fabricated here were taken back to the United States.  Under a Turkish investigation that became public in 2013, prosecutors accused Zarrab and high-ranking Turkish officials of involvement in facilitating Iranian money transfers via gold smuggling, leaked documents at the time showed.  Erdogan, then prime minister, cast the case as a coup attempt orchestrated by his political enemies. Several prosecutors were removed from the case, police investigators were reassigned, and the investigation was later dropped. Turkey blames Gulen s followers for the July 2016 failed coup, when a group of rogue soldiers attempted to overthrow the government and killed more than 250 people. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied any involvement and condemned the coup.  Turkey has repeatedly requested Gulen s extradition, but U.S. officials have said the courts require sufficient evidence before they can extradite the elderly cleric.  The United States says its judiciary is independent of any political or other interference. Cavusoglu said he had informed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of what Ankara sees as the Gulenists  attempts to spread their influence.  I told him very openly that I believe that FETO has infiltrated his missions here in Turkey through the local staff, and the Halkbank case and the Zarrab case are very much FETO-motivated ones. I am very open. He didn t make a comment on this,  Cavusoglu said. Last month Turkey arrested a local employee working at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul over alleged links to Gulen s network, prompting an angry reaction from Washington that led to both countries scaling back visa services they provide for each other s nationals. On Nov. 6, Ankara and Washington said they would resume visa services on a limited basis, although ties remain strained. [nL8N1NM6XB] ",0
"Iceland PM calls snap election after coalition party quits over 'breach of trust' REYKJAVIK (Reuters) - Iceland s prime minister called for a snap parliamentary election on Friday after one party in the ruling coalition quit the government formed less than nine months ago. The outgoing party, Bright Future, cited a  breach of trust  after Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson s party allegedly tried to cover up a scandal involving his father.  That leaves the country, whose economy was wrecked by the collapse of its banking system nearly a decade ago, facing its second snap election in less than a year. The outgoing government would be the shortest-living in Iceland s history. The previous government was felled by the Panama Papers scandal over offshore tax havens.   We have lost the majority and I don t see anything that indicates we can regain that. I am calling an election,  Benediktsson told reporters. He said he would be looking to hold the election in November though that would mean it would not be possible to finish next year s budget. It is ultimately up to President Gudni Johannesson, whom Benediktsson will meet with on Saturday, to make the decision on a new election.  If he accepts the call for an election he is likely to ask the government to stay in place until a new coalition is formed but he could also ask other parties to try form a majority. Johannesson was not immediately available for comment. The news knocked more than 1 percent off the value of the Icelandic crown against the euro and the dollar. The scandal revolves around a letter written by Benediktsson s father to help an old friend have his criminal record expunged after he was convicted of sex offences against children.    The board of Bright Future has decided to terminate cooperation with the government of Bjarni Benediktsson,  the party said in a statement.  The reason for the split is a serious breach of trust within the government.   The Ministry of Justice, under Sigridur Andersen, a member of Benediktsson s Independence Party, initially refused to disclose who had written the letter of recommendation. She was later ordered to do so by a parliamentary committee. Andersen told broadcaster Stod 2 that she had informed Benediktsson about his father s involvement in July but had not told anyone else.       I was told by the justice minister that we were discussing confidential matters, which followed the rules of the ministry...I decided to handle the issue as a confidential matter,  Benediktsson said. He had later informed the chairmen of the coalition parties, he said.  First, it was illegal for me to indulge the information, second, I informed them when I could.  The prime minister s father, Benedikt Sveinsson, confirmed on Friday that he had signed a letter supporting his friend s application to have his  honor restored , a procedure that effectively erases a criminal record. Among the requirements is a letter of recommendation from a close friend or associate.        Sveinsson said he had not discussed the letter with anyone.  This week, it came forth that my father had written a letter... I couldn t have written such a letter myself and I will never try to defend that,  Bendiktsson told a news  conference. Capital Economics economist Stephen Brown said a change of government could frustrate plans to overhaul Iceland s monetary policy framework. Benediktsson s administration has asked experts to look at options, including pegging the crown to the euro or the pound to keep sharp shifts in the currency from  destabilising the economy. The central bank cut interest rates four times in the year to June to tame the crown. The currency has soared on the back of a tourism boom that has helped the economy recover from years of crisis but increased the risks of overheating. The strong currency is also hurting Iceland s exports.       I think if there s going to be another election and possibly the chance of a more left-wing government, then that probably decreases the chance of monetary policy being loosened any further in the future,  Brown said.   That could be quite important.  ",0
"Battle over bathrooms looms large in North Carolina governor's race WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - In a year of police shooting protests, historic hurricane flooding and voting rights clashes in North Carolina, it is the battle over bathrooms that could prove pivotal in the Tar Heel state’s gubernatorial race. The election will effectively serve as a referendum on a state law that bans transgender people from using government-run restrooms that match their gender identity and limits protections for gays and lesbians. Signed by Republican Governor Pat McCrory in March, the law has been blamed for hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses and the relocation of major sporting events from the ninth largest U.S. state. Opponents of the law say the vote on Tuesday also could have national implications. If McCrory loses to Democratic challenger Roy Cooper, they said, elected officials backing such measures in other states will face greater political risk.  “I believe a strong message already has been sent to lawmakers across the country,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights organization. “I believe and hope on Election Day that an even stronger message will be sent.” The advocacy group has joined with Equality North Carolina for a broad effort to boost voter turnout and unseat McCrory and other supporters of the law known as House Bill 2. The organizations are targeting about 400,000 pro-equality voters in the state, including an estimated 255,800 LGBT voters, Griffin said. The Human Rights Campaign said that voting bloc could make a difference in a presidential swing state where Democrat Barack Obama won by about 14,000 votes in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney led by about 92,000 votes in 2012. “There’s no question this is going to be a very close race at the top of the ticket, and the LGBTQ voting bloc really has the ability to impact the outcome of this election,” said Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality North Carolina. RACE A TOSS-UP Elections experts consider the race between McCrory and Cooper, one of 12 U.S. gubernatorial seats being decided on Tuesday, to be among the country’s most competitive.  Public opinion polls have been tight most of the year, though the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys shows Cooper with a slight advantage. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found that, among residents who expect to vote, 38 percent were less likely to support McCrory’s re-election bid as a result of the law and its fallout, compared with 32 percent who were more likely to support him. The poll was conducted online in English between Oct. 6 and Oct. 19. It included 1,233 likely voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. Other polls have shown a majority of residents believe the law is hurting the state. McCrory, who in 2012 became North Carolina’s first Republican governor in two decades, has blamed the backlash against the law on national groups trying to redefine gender and “basic norms of privacy.” Cooper says the law is discriminatory, and he has made McCrory’s support for it a central issue of his campaign. An ad campaign launched last week by the conservative NC Values Coalition accuses Cooper, the state’s attorney general since 2001, of putting women and children at risk by refusing to defend H.B. 2. “By not defending it, he’s allowing men into women’s bathrooms,” the group’s executive director, Tami Fitzgerald, said in a phone interview. “We think that just goes too far.” “Equality NC and HRC have made North Carolina ground zero for their radical LGBT agenda,” she added. “But I believe that their efforts will fail.” At early voting sites in North Carolina this week, the issue appeared to be galvanizing people on both sides. “I admire McCrory for standing behind H.B. 2,” said Republican Parker Umstead, 81, a certified public accountant who cast a ballot in Winston-Salem for the incumbent. “It takes courage to stand up for your beliefs.” But Holly Carpenter, a 41-year-old Republican from Cary who works in the medical field, cited the measure as the prime reason why she voted against McCrory, whom she supported in 2012. “To lose so many economic opportunities over that was just a huge negative for me,” she said.

"Saudi king says kingdom has made progress in tackling terrorism MECCA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi King Salman, receiving dignitaries attending the annual Muslim haj pilgrimage, said on Saturday the kingdom had made progress in eradicating terrorism aimed at attacking its holy sites, state news agency SPA reported. Saudi Arabia, which stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam s holiest sites and organizing the haj, has been hit by bombings in recent years and uncovered plots to carry out attacks in Mecca.  The limbs of terrorism have sought to harm the holy cities, paying no attention to their sanctity,  SPA quoted King Salman as telling foreign dignitaries at a reception he held in Mecca, where more than 2 million pilgrims are performing haj.   But the kingdom, by the grace of God and in cooperation with its sisters and friends, has made big successes in eradicating terrorism and has worked decisively and with determination to dry its sources,  he added, without elaborating. Salman also said Saudi Arabia had devoted all its material and human resources to ensure the safety of pilgrims who come from all over the world to perform the five-day ritual, a religious duty to be undertaken once in a lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford the journey.  We are determined, with God s permission, to continue to provide the highest level of services for the two holy mosques ... to ensure the safety of those who seek the sacred house of God,  he said. The pilgrimage has frequently been hit by stampedes and fires. In the most recent incident, hundreds of pilgrims were killed in a crush two years ago. ",0
"Trump’s Take on Corporate Tax Rate Could Look Very Much Like Obama’s - The New York Times Just a few days after being sworn in as president, Donald J. Trump convened a meeting at the White House of some of the nation’s most prominent chief executives to discuss how to improve manufacturing. Mr. Trump was joined by Elon Musk of Tesla, Mark Fields of Ford, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, Marillyn A. Hewson of Lockheed Martin and Michael Dell of Dell, among others. Before the meeting formally began, with cameras rolling, Mr. Trump wanted to talk about corporate tax rates  —   specifically lowering them. During one debate with Hillary Clinton, he had told voters: “Under my plan, I’ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That’s going to be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan. It’s going to be a beautiful thing to watch. ” He repeated the 15 percent figure over and over again. However, when Mr. Trump spoke to the C. E. O.s that morning, he shifted the goal post slightly: “We’re trying to get it down to anywhere from 15 to 20 percent. ” Inside the White House, until last Friday, according to people involved in the conversations, the target rate had been bumped up again, to a minimum of 20 percent and very likely a bit more. And now, given that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is off the table  —   and with it the $1 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years that the administration needed to help make its tax plan deficit neutral  —   there is a good chance that any tax package would include a corporate rate that is even further from Mr. Trump’s initial pledge, perhaps as high as 28 percent. Don’t take my word for it. That’s the figure that Grover Norquist, the   activist who is the president of Americans for Tax Reform, and who has long sought the lowest rate possible, has calculated would be needed for the plan to be deficit neutral after 10 years. That way it could come under the heading of budget reconciliation, which would allow the Senate to pass legislation with a simple majority. If the 28 percent corporate tax rate sounds familiar, that’s because it is: It was the same rate that President Barack Obama proposed in 2012 and again in 2013, when he also proposed to lower the tax rate for United States manufacturers to 25 percent. He made the proposal again in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Each time, his tax plan was summarily dismissed by Republicans who called the rate too high and uncompetitive. Now, Republicans may end up negotiating a tax package with a corporate tax rate that looks a lot like the one they rejected out of hand for the last five years. Why is the rate so important? Because almost all those on Wall Street  —   and in corner offices throughout corporate America  —   have been baking into their models a tax reform plan that they say will   additional investments, leading to higher growth in the economy. As an example, Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of ATT, told analysts this year, “We know at ATT that if you saw tax rates move to 20 percent to 25 percent, we know what we would do: We would step up our investment levels. ” Some of those investments become harder to justify if the rate is higher, executives say. The Standard  Poor’s   index already has an effective tax rate of about 28 percent, according to WalletHub. The United States has the highest top statutory corporate tax rate among Group of 20 nations, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office. As evidenced by the stock market’s pullback on Friday and again on Monday, investors and analysts are redoing their math to account for the fact that tax reform may not happen as soon as they expected  —   the Trump administration had said it would happen by August  —   and that rates will not come down as much as had been anticipated. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who oversaw the effort to repeal Obamacare, acknowledged that the bill’s failure would “make tax reform more difficult. ” He has yet to publish a new set of corporate tax rates, but his original plan called for a rate of 20 percent. That plan depended not only on Obamacare’s repeal, to save $1 trillion, but also on another plan that seems increasingly unlikely to gain support: a   border adjustment tax  —   a euphemism for an import tax on all goods  —   that was expected to raise another $1 trillion over 10 years. The border adjustment tax, an obsession of Mr. Ryan’s, has divided Mr. Trump’s advisers. Stephen K. Bannon has been a proponent, seeing it as an incentive for more companies to make goods here in the United States. Others, like Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross and Steven Mnuchin, have been more ambivalent, people involved in the discussions say, in part because other countries could retaliate, making it harder for United States manufacturers to export goods. Many American retailers, like Walmart, and even some manufacturers  —   including Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which make some car models in Mexico and Canada and import them into this country  —   have expressed their anxiety about how a border adjustment tax would affect their business. Given the squabbling within the Republican Party over the repeal of Obamacare, it’s hard to imagine that a congressman with constituents including big retailers  —   retail jobs outnumber manufacturing jobs in the United States by about four to one  —   would vote in favor of a border adjustment tax. “The border adjustment tax, the most controversial piece of current   discussions, is less likely to pass,” Société Générale wrote in a note to clients over the weekend. “If Congress fails to approve tax reform ahead of August, confidence is likely to slip. Congress could still pass a bill by the end of the calendar year, but even that could slip. ” Without the $2 trillion in revenue and tax savings that the border adjustment tax and Obamacare repeal would generate, it is virtually impossible to see how the Trump administration could find a path to a corporate tax rate anywhere near what it originally promised. (Of course, the administration could pull back on its pledge to lower taxes for the middle class, but that seems unlikely.) The   question is whether lowering corporate taxes would ultimately have the desired effect. “While there is no doubt that tax policy can influence economic choices,” a study by the Brookings Institution determined, “it is by no means obvious, on an ex ante basis, that tax rate cuts will ultimately lead to a larger economy in the long run. ”",0
"Turkey detains lawyers of hunger-striking teachers ahead of trial ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey issued detention warrants for the lawyers of two hunger-striking teachers on Tuesday, days before they are due to appear in court, lawyers representing the academics said. Nuriye Gulmen, a literature professor, and Semih Ozakca, a primary school teacher, have been on hunger strike for more than six months after they lost their jobs in a crackdown following a failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan. Doctors say they have been surviving on liquids and supplements, but have described their condition as dangerously weak for several months. Authorities detained them in May saying they had links to the militant leftist DHKP-C group, deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey.  The warrants were issued for 18 lawyers, all members of two law offices defending the teachers.  The detention of our colleagues today is an attempt in vain to leave Gulmen and Ozakca defenseless,  a lawyer representing the pair told Reuters, adding that more than 2,000 lawyers had applied to defend them due to the case s symbolic importance. Police raided lawyers  offices in Istanbul and Ankara and detained 10 lawyers, while the search for eight others continued. On Thursday, Gulmen and Ozakca will appear in court for the first time since their arrest. So far, 150,000 state employees including civil servants, academics and security personnel have been fired since last year s coup attempt, which Erdogan blamed on followers of U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies any involvement. Critics accuse the government of using the coup as a pretext to purge dissident voices from public institutions. Last month, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a request by the two teachers to order Ankara to release them on health grounds. ",0
"Taiwan president visits U.S. territory of Guam despite Chinese ire HAGATNA, Guam (Reuters) - Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen arrived on the U.S. Pacific island of Guam on Friday on her way back from visiting diplomatic allies in the Pacific - a trip that caused strong objections from China, which claims Taiwan as its own. Beijing had urged the United States not to allow Tsai to transit its territory on her trip, which included two days in Hawaii before she headed on to Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands. The timing is particularly touchy as U.S. President Donald Trump is due in Beijing next week. China regards self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as its sovereign territory and regularly calls it the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States, strongly objecting to transit stops by Taiwanese presidents. While the office of Guam Governor Edward B. Calvo described Tsai s visit as  private and unofficial , she was provided with a police escort upon her arrival.  Speaking at a banquet, Tsai said that  Taiwan and Guam share a unique friendship.  She described Guam as the  closest part of the United States  to Taiwan, adding:  The people of Taiwan are grateful for your support.  James F. Moriarty, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, the U.S. mission in Taiwan, said Hawaii, Guam and Taiwan were bound together not only by the Pacific Ocean but also by  an expectation of democracy.   Guam is home to a large U.S. military base and would be key to any U.S. assistance to Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China. Beijing has never renounced the possible use of force to bring the island under its control. Relations between Beijing and Taipei have nosedived since Tsai was elected last year; China believes she wants formal independence for Taiwan, a red line for Beijing. For her part, Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s democracy and security. The U.S. State Department had said Tsai s transits through U.S. soil would be  private and unofficial  and based on long-standing U.S. practice consistent with  our unofficial relations with Taiwan . Last December, Trump angered Beijing by taking a telephone call from Tsai shortly after winning the presidential election. Tsai has been in the United States twice this year. In January, she stopped over in Houston and San Francisco on her way to and from Latin America. ",0

"Maria Sharapova Is Suspended From Tennis for Two Years - The New York Times Maria Sharapova, a   Grand Slam champion and one of the world’s   female athletes, was suspended for two years Wednesday when an International Tennis Federation tribunal ruled that she unintentionally committed a doping violation. Sharapova announced in March that she tested positive for meldonium on Jan. 26 at the Australian Open and began serving a provisional suspension. Meldonium, a heart medication that is said to improve blood flow and allow athletes to recover faster, was added to the World   Agency’s prohibited list on Jan. 1 after the agency monitored its use for a year. Sharapova, 29, said she had been taking Mildronate, whose active ingredient is meldonium, since 2006 to help manage a variety of health problems and was not aware that the drug had been banned. After a hearing May 18 and 19, a   tribunal appointed by the I. T. F. ruled that while Sharapova’s doping violation was not intentional, “she does bear sole responsibility for the contravention, and very significant fault, in failing to take any steps to check whether the continued use of this medicine was permissible. ” Sharapova faced a suspension of up to four years if the tribunal decided her doping violation was intentional. Because of her prompt admission of her violation, the I. T. F. said, the suspension will be backdated to begin on Jan. 26, and she will be eligible to return at midnight on Jan. 25, 2018. Sharapova is the   tennis player to have a positive doping test. She said in a statement released on her Facebook page that she would appeal the suspension through the Court of Arbitration for Sport. “I cannot accept an unfairly harsh   suspension,” she said. “The tribunal, whose members were selected by the I. T. F. agreed that I did not do anything intentionally wrong, yet they seek to keep me from playing tennis for two years. ” A   suspension could have been career ending, but if her ban is upheld, Sharapova, who has missed long periods on the tour because of injuries and has seen her ranking fall to No. 26, would be 30 when she returned to a sport in which Serena Williams and Roger Federer remain top players in their  . A lengthy doping suspension could harm Sharapova’s   brand, but she received support Wednesday from Nike, which along with other sponsors had suspended its relationship with her after the positive doping test was revealed in March. “The I. T. F. tribunal has found that Maria did not intentionally break its rules,” the company said in a statement. “Maria has always made her position clear, has apologized for her mistake and is now appealing the length of the ban. Based on the decision of the I. T. F. and their factual findings, we hope to see Maria back on court and will continue to partner with her. ” The Court of Arbitration for Sport has been sympathetic to tennis players in recent appeals. In 2013, the court reduced Viktor Troicki’s   ban for refusing to submit a blood sample to 12 months and cut Marin Cilic’s   ban for unknowingly ingesting a banned stimulant to four months. “We always viewed this as a   process, I. T. F. first, then C. A. S,” John Haggerty, Sharapova’s lawyer, said in an email. Haggerty said he believed the I. T. F. wanted to make an example out of Sharapova because she is a famous athlete and to send a message that the federation was tough on doping. “I believe that at C. A. S. ,” he added, “which is made up of an arbitrator selected by Maria, one selected by the I. T. F. and a neutral arbitrator selected by C. A. S. Maria’s suspension will be reduced and she will return to tennis sooner. ” Sharapova and her representatives have said that her   use of Mildronate was to protect her health, not enhance her performance. Since January, more than 300 athletes, many from Russia and other Eastern European countries, have tested positive for meldonium, which is not approved for sale in the United States or the European Union but is sold over the counter in Russia and some other Eastern European countries. The Russian sports ministry, in particular, has been critical of the way the World   Agency handled banning meldonium, arguing that the drug was not performance enhancing. Last month, the Russian sports ministry said that most of its athletes had been reinstated after WADA issued new guidelines on the length of time meldonium takes to leave the body, and athletes were able to prove their positive tests had resulted from using the drug before it was banned. Such leniency was not available to Sharapova, who used meldonium after Jan. 1. The tribunal’s report on the case said Sharapova admitted taking 500 milligrams of Mildronate before each of her five matches at the Australian Open, where she lost to Williams in the quarterfinals. The report also disclosed that meldonium was found in an    test in Moscow on Feb. 2. The report detailed Sharapova’s history using the drug, which dated to 2006, when she was 18. Mildronate was among 18 medications and supplements recommended by a Moscow doctor, Anatoly Skalny, to help Sharapova manage frequent illnesses by boosting her immune system. None of the medications were on WADA’s prohibited list at the time. Sharapova worked with Skalny through 2012 and, according to the report, he regularly checked the WADA prohibited list to assure the compliance of his recommendations, which at one point grew to 30 substances. But Sharapova, overwhelmed by the number of pills, changed her approach to nutrition in early 2013 and continued to use only three medications: Magnerot, Riboxin and Mildronate, which she believed would protect her heart and manage her magnesium deficiency, the report said. Since 2013, the report said, the only members of Sharapova’s team who knew she was taking meldonium regularly were her father, Yuri, and her agent, Max Eisenbud. Sharapova also did not disclose the use of the Mildronate or meldonium on any doping control forms since 2014, saying that she thought it was necessary only for substances she took daily. “I did not feel it was a responsibility to have to write down every single match drink I was taking, gel, vitamin I was taking, even if I took it once during the last seven days,” she is quoted as saying in the tribunal’s report. “I did not think it was of high importance. ” The report called her failure to disclose her use of meldonium to antidoping authorities, her doctors, her coach, her trainer, her nutritionist or any other member of her team “a very serious breach of her duty to comply with the rules. ” “This was a deliberate decision, not a mistake,” the ruling said. Haggerty said that players were not required to list everything they were taking. “For 10 years Mildronate was not on the prohibited list, so Maria had no reason to hide her use of it,” he said. The report repeatedly rejected Sharapova’s argument that the I. T. F. failed to sufficiently warn her that Mildronate had been added to the banned list. WADA published its prohibited list for 2016 on Sept. 29. A summary of the changes to the list was posted on the I. T. F. website on Dec. 7. The WTA and I. T. F. sent subsequent emails in December that included links to the antidoping program, but, Sharapova argued, they did not mention changes to the prohibited list. The federation also issued a wallet card that lists prohibited substances and gave one to Sharapova’s coach, Sven Groeneveld, in January, the report said. The report said that it was relevant to consider that Sharapova had used meldonium for 10 years before it was prohibited, but “she had a continuing duty to review the Prohibited List each year and from at least 2013 onwards did not take any steps to do so. ” Eisenbud, a top agent for IMG, took the blame for what he called “an administrative error” of not alerting Sharapova to meldonium’s changed status. The tribunal found his reasons for failing to check the banned list even more dubious than Sharapova’s. Eisenbud said he had a routine of checking updates to the WADA prohibited list during his annual family vacation in the Caribbean in November, but the trip was canceled last year because of his separation from his wife. The tribunal asked “why it was necessary to take a file to the Caribbean to read by the pool when one email could have provided the answer. ” The report put the responsibility squarely on Sharapova, saying if she had been more open about her use of meldonium, this situation could have been avoided. The tribunal, while confirming that she did not knowingly commit a doping violation, found “moral fault” in her conduct. “It may be that she genuinely believed that Mildronate had some general beneficial effect on her heath, but the manner in which the medication was taken, its concealment from the antidoping authorities, her failure to disclose it even to her own team and the lack of any medical justification must inevitably lead to the conclusion that she took Mildronate for the purpose of enhancing performance,” the report said. The tribunal conceded, though, that if Sharapova  —   or anyone on her team  —   had known that Mildronate was banned, she would have stopped taking it. The report concludes, “She is the sole author of her own misfortune. ”",0
"Pinera wins first round of Chile election, faces runoff SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Conservative billionaire Sebastian Pinera will face center-left Senator Alejandro Guillier in a runoff for Chile s presidency next month, after a first round vote on Sunday that Pinera won, but with fewer votes than expected. Both candidates would keep in place the top copper exporter s longstanding free-market economic model, but former president Pinera has promised investor-friendly policies to turbocharge growth, while Guillier wants to press on with outgoing President Michelle Bachelet s overhaul of education, taxes and labor. With over 98 percent of votes counted, Pinera, a 67-year-old businessman, had clinched 36.6 percent, falling short of the 50 percent needed for an outright victory, Chile s electoral agency Servel said. Guillier, a 64-year-old bearded former TV news anchor elected to the Senate in 2013, had 22.7 percent, just over two points ahead of the third placed candidate, leftist Beatriz Sanchez, whose better than expected showing will likely ensure her Frente Amplio coalition will yield sway in Congress. Pinera s result was below pollster expectations, indicating that the Dec. 17 runoff will likely be a more closely-fought contest than previously forecast, especially if Guillier can rally supporters of Sanchez and four other left-leaning rivals behind him.      We re going to have a very competitive second round,  Pinera s campaign chief Andres Chadwick told journalists on Sunday evening. The most recent opinion survey by CEP last month had forecast Pinera securing 42 percent of likely votes in the first round, and easily defeating Guillier in the runoff. After a divisive race, Guillier called for  profound unity  to unite Chile s fractured left against Pinera.  There are more of us, and therefore we must win in December!,  Guillier told his cheering supporters.  Sanchez did not endorse Guillier in a fiery speech before her followers, even as she pilloried his opponent.  Sebastian Pinera is a step backward for the country and the country is going in a different direction!  Sanchez said. But Pinera, who previously led Chile between 2010 and 2014, flashed the optimism he has shown on the campaign trail, where he has repeatedly plugged his campaign slogan  better times.   This result is very similar to the one in 2009. And you ll remember that in 2009 we won the election,  Pinera said, before a buoyant crowd. Voter turnout was higher than expected, a factor which analysts forecast will count against Pinera if repeated in a runoff. Bachelet cannot run again this year because of term limits. Guillier was one of two candidates her center-left coalition Nueva Mayoria backed in the first round. Speaking from the presidential palace on Sunday evening, she urged Chileans to vote in December, saying her policy changes were at stake. Guillier faces a more polished opponent in Pinera, who oversaw robust economic growth in his first presidential term that overlapped with higher copper prices.     Pinera has vowed to double Chile s economic growth rate, with proposals that include trimming corporate taxes, making state-run miner Codelco more self-sufficient, and tweaking the pension system to include incentives for later retirement. But he must ease fears that he would wipe out gains made in Bachelet s government for students, women and workers - from expanding free education to strengthening unions. Should Guillier triumph in the runoff, he has pledged to tackle stubbornly high inequality in one of Latin America s most business-friendly economies. He wants to diversify Chile s dependence on copper, increase access to free higher education and write workers  rights into a new constitution.  I voted for Guillier because I think we have to continue to provide free education. It s a social right,  said unemployed voter Mario Giannetti, 53. Since its transition to democracy from dictatorship in 1990, Chile has stood out as one of the region s most developed countries. But public debt has grown as lower copper prices hit government revenues in recent years, and Bachelet s critics say she failed to court investments or prioritize economic growth that slowed to an annual average of 1.8 percent. In a first since the 1990s, credit ratings agencies Fitch and S&P downgraded Chile s debt rating this year. While investors see Pinera as a safe pair hands for the economy, his previous term was marred by massive student protests seeking an education overhaul. His responses were often seen as out of touch and grassroots groups still oppose him. Early on Sunday, a group of young protesters stormed Pinera s campaign headquarters before being arrested by police, TV images showed. ",0
"California Governor Signs Legislation Limiting Assault Weapons - The New York Times LOS ANGELES  —   Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday signed legislation that would impose new restrictions on assault weapons and regulate the sale of ammunition in California, cementing the state’s reputation for enacting some of the most stringent gun regulations in the country. Propelled by the reaction to mass shootings in San Bernardino, in Southern California, and Orlando, Fla. the gun regulations are the latest example of how this state, where the Legislature is under Democratic control, has been able to enact a legislative agenda on issues that have deadlocked Congress. The legislation in Sacramento was passed with overwhelming Democratic support, and was largely opposed by Republicans who make up a small minority in the Senate and the Assembly. Even as he signed six measures, Mr. Brown, a moderate Democrat with a history of resistance to some measures of gun control, vetoed five others that he described as overly regulative. Among them was a bill that would have restricted gun purchases to no more than one per person in a   period. “My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of   gun owners,” Mr. Brown, who himself owns guns, said in his signing message. The enactment of the legislation leaves little doubt to the standing of California, which in 1989 became the first state to ban assault weapons, as a leader in gun control at a moment when Congress has rebuffed such efforts and numerous   states are moving in the other direction. States like Texas, in the name of promoting safety, have in recent years expanded the locations where people can carry concealed weapons, including bars and college campuses. “This makes California the most   state in America,” said Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association. In a statement, she called the legislation a “a draconian gun control package that turns California’s   gun owners into   citizens. ” “The governor and Legislature exploited a terrorist attack to push these measures through even though the state’s   laws did nothing to stop the attack in San Bernardino,” she said. Amanda Wilcox, legislative advocate for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, hailed the governor’s action as a step forward in efforts to curb gun violence. She highlighted one bill sponsored by Senator Kevin de León, the Senate’s Democratic leader, requiring background checks for ammunition purchases as particularly crucial. “It is really   and bold, and really has the potential to save a lot of lives,” Ms. Wilcox said. “It can give us a handle on who has illegal guns in the state, as well as limiting access to ammunition by dangerous people who may have illegal guns. ” The new laws would prohibit the possession of   magazines  —   those holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition  —   for assault weapons. “These     magazines are not for target shooting or hunting,” said Senator Loni Hancock, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Their sole purpose is to kill as many people as possible in the shortest period of time. ” A separate bill banned semiautomatic weapons with “bullet buttons,” which make it easy to quickly remove a magazine and replace it with another. Among the bills Mr. Brown vetoed was one that would have expanded the definition of a firearm. “While I appreciate the author’s intent, the actual wording of the bill is unduly vague and could have   and unintended consequences,” Mr. Brown wrote in his veto message. Shannon Grove, a Republican Assembly member who spoke out against the bills during the debate, said that none of those signed would reduce gun violence or prevent mass shootings. Instead, she said, the restrictions compromised the rights of California families to protect themselves. “I think it’s death by 1, 000 paper cuts for our Second Amendment rights,” she said. “Nowhere in this nation do you give up your rights under any other amendments. ” The signing was not the end of gun control measures that might be enacted here in the wake of a wave of violence that has traumatized the world and the nation, including the shooting  in San Bernardino that killed 14 people at a holiday party in December. A separate set of gun control measures will appear before voters in November some of them have been passed by the Legislature, but Mr. Brown vetoed those, saying they should be left to voters to decide. That initiative is being championed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is running for governor after Mr. Brown’s final term ends in 2018. His initiative would, among other things, make firearm theft a felony and require ammunition vendors to report lost or stolen supplies within 48 hours. “Today’s steps in the right direction will grow into a giant leap forward for public safety if voters pass the Safety for All initiative to keep guns and ammo out of the wrong hands,” Mr. Newsom said. Gun death rates fell 56 percent in California from 1993 and 2010, a larger decline than in the nation as a whole, according to a study by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Gun control advocates pointed to that as evidence that such laws were effective. “Gun laws work,” Ms. Wilcox said. “California gun sales are really high. We are not deterring   people from buying guns. We’re doing a better job of making sure dangerous people don’t have guns. ” But Ms. Grove pointed to the ammunition law as an example of a measure that would hurt the interests of gun owners without doing anything to curb gun violence. “Criminals who are not authorized to have firearms in the first place are not going to register to buy ammunition,” she said. “It’s absurd. ”",0
"Campaign Over, President Trump Will Hold a (What Else?) Campaign Rally - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   In an extraordinarily swift return to politicking after a tumultuous first month in office, the White House on Wednesday said President Trump will hold the first campaign rally of his    administration on Saturday. The rally, to be held in an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Fla. is an indication that Mr. Trump, who has sometimes felt isolated in the White House, is eager to get outside of Washington and relive the rapturous reception that greeted him during the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump exulted in large crowds assembled at cavernous venues throughout his 2016 bid, and spent the first days of his presidency quibbling over how many Americans attended his inauguration. On Wednesday, during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump answered a question about whether his administration was flirting with xenophobia and racism in part by noting the support he received in the election. “I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had  —   306 Electoral College votes,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s tremendous enthusiasm out there. ” Not long after, in a posting on Twitter, Mr. Trump invited his nearly 25 million followers to attend the Saturday evening event, which will take place just up the coast from his    retreat in Palm Beach where he plans to spend the weekend. It will be his third weekend in a row on Florida’s Gold Coast. “We are going to put America back to work,” a message accompanying the posting said. “We are going to put people before government. ” The White House would not provide any additional information about the rally. Officials referred questions to a member of Mr. Trump’s political organization, who also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “It’s being run by the campaign,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday, without elaborating. He would not say why the president would be holding a campaign rally so soon after taking office. The rally will be only the second public appearance by Mr. Trump outside of Washington since he took office. On Friday, he is scheduled to visit a Boeing plant in North Charleston, S. C. for the unveiling of the aerospace manufacturer’s new Dreamliner aircraft. Mr. Trump filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for his 2020   campaign on Jan. 20, the day he was sworn in. That allowed him to continue to accept contributions  —   including proceeds from the sales of his popular red “Make America Great Again” hats  —   without running afoul of the law. Mr. Trump ended the 2016 campaign flush with funds, in part because of substantial sales of the hats. At the end of 2016, he had $7, 611, 702. 92 cash on hand and no debt. The rally comes at a precarious time for Mr. Trump, as his White House is reeling from personnel turmoil and has yet to score any legislative victories. On Tuesday, he accepted the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who had become embroiled in allegations that he had improper contacts with Russian officials before Mr. Trump took office. That was followed on Wednesday by the abrupt withdrawal of Andrew F. Puzder, the president’s nominee to be secretary of labor, amid allegations that he had abused his   and employed an illegal immigrant. Mr. Trump had vowed to move quickly to put his policy agenda in place once in the White House. But his effort to use executive power to crack down on immigration has faltered in the face of legal challenges, and his administration has yet to issue a proposal either for repealing the health care law he railed against during the campaign or enacting the tax overhaul he has promised. Larry M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group, said he was not aware of any president having held a campaign rally this early in his tenure. “Usually, they are too busy trying to get their administration in place,” Mr. Noble said. “More importantly, normally the president wants to delay candidate status so that he can travel as president making speeches, announcing new policies and actions, promoting his agenda and attacking his opponents in Congress without having to use campaign funds. ” Barack Obama did not file his statement of candidacy for   until April 2011, more than two years after he took office, while George W. Bush waited until May of 2003 and Bill Clinton until April of 1995. Mr. Trump may be moving now, Mr. Noble said, to ensure he can address a friendly crowd devoid of protesters. “My guess is that he intends to control who is invited to the rally and press access by calling the rally a candidate event and paying for it out of campaign funds,” Mr. Noble said. “If it was an official White House event, he would have less control over it. ” Mr. Trump is likely to travel to the event on Air Force One and will have a sizable contingent of Secret Service and staff aides with him, as presidents always do when they travel. Campaign finance laws dictate that the cost of such a flight be shared between the campaign organizing the rally and the White House. It is not abnormal for a sitting president to hold a political rally in the months before an election, and Mr. Trump has said he plans to campaign actively for Republicans who support him and against Democrats who seek to stymie his agenda. But Mr. Trump’s return to the campaign trail on Saturday is unusually early. Even the midterm congressional elections for members of Congress are still 21 months away.",0
"The Artist Peter Doig Wins a Case Involving a Painting’s Attribution - The New York Times The celebrated artist Peter Doig did not create a    landscape painting, despite the claims of the former corrections officer who owns it, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday. As a result, he was not responsible for destroying the plaintiffs’ plan to sell the work for millions of dollars. The ruling, after seven days of heated and sometimes bizarre testimony in federal court this month in Chicago, would appear to end one of the stranger art authentication cases in recent history. It had pitted Mr. Doig, a   artist whose works routinely sell for $10 million, against the owner of the painting and that man’s art dealer. They had accused Mr. Doig of falsely denying that he had created the work as a young man in Canada, thus scuttling their efforts to sell it. “Peter Doig could not have been the author of this work,” Judge Gary Feinerman said. Mr. Doig, who was not in court but called in to hear the ruling, said from Rome by telephone that he felt angry that he had been forced to prove he had not painted the work. “I feel a living artist should be the one who gets to say yea or nay and not be taken to task and forced to go back 40 years in time. It was painstaking to piece this together,” he said. Mr. Doig, 57, who was born in Britain and grew up in Canada and Trinidad, has created haunted, magical landscapes that have made him among the world’s most popular artists. During the trial, the former corrections officer, Robert Fletcher, sought to prove that the painting, an untitled acrylic on canvas of a rocky desert scene, signed “Pete Doige 76,” was an early work by Mr. Doig. Mr. Fletcher said he met Mr. Doig in the 1970s, when, he said, the artist was attending Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, about 900 miles northwest of Toronto. According to Mr. Fletcher, they met again when Mr. Doig was serving a brief sentence for LSD possession at a nearby correctional center, where Mr. Fletcher saw him create the painting. Later, serving as Mr. Doig’s parole officer, Mr. Fletcher said he had helped the artist land a job and bought the painting for $100. Five years ago, a friend noticed the painting hanging on Mr. Fletcher’s wall and told him that the work was by a famous artist. In 2013, Mr. Fletcher and Peter Bartlow, the Chicago art dealer who agreed to help him sell the painting, filed suit in United States District Court for Northern Illinois, arguing that Mr. Doig was denying authorship because of a vendetta against Mr. Fletcher. Seeking nearly $8 million in damages and a court declaration that the work was authentic, Mr. Fletcher testified during the trial that he felt disrespected by Mr. Doig because the artist did not show any gratitude to Mr. Fletcher for setting him on a path toward fame and riches. Mr. Doig told the court that he had never attended Lakehead nor been incarcerated. Instead, he and his lawyers said the work in question was painted by another man, Peter Edward Doige, who died in 2012. One of Mr. Doige’s sisters produced evidence at trial that her brother was at Lakehead University, and testified that he was an inmate at the correctional center, that he liked to paint and that the signature on the work was his. And a former art teacher at the corrections center recalled watching it being painted by Mr. Doige over at least five weeks between 1976 and 1977. That the case ever went to trial surprised many in the art world. Authentication disputes tend to involve the works of dead artists. In this case, a very alive Mr. Doig found himself forced to prove that he did not create something. To show that he had not been in prison in the 1970s, Mr. Doig dredged up a school yearbook his mother’s letters about his appearing in “Romeo and Juliet” at his Toronto high school and working on oil rigs in western Canada and friends’ written testimony about his skiing in Utah. The plaintiffs’ response was to take up many hours of the trial with somewhat unorthodox efforts to demonstrate similarities between the painting and Mr. Doig’s works. The plaintiffs had also argued that rather than hiding youthful drug use  —   which Mr. Doig has admitted  —   or a prison past, the artist was embarrassed by the painting because he had used it as the basis for many other works. The plaintiffs’ case was weakened, art market experts said, because they could produce only one expert witness to authenticate the painting as a Doig. That witness, Mr. Bartlow, proved problematic: He was one of the plaintiffs, and  —   as revealed during the trial  —   had a 25 percent interest in any proceeds. The judge’s ruling said any similarities between the desert scene and Mr. Doig’s paintings were “purely coincidental. ” William F. Zieske, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said they were disappointed by the ruling and had not decided yet whether to appeal. “I still think the painting may be authentic,” he said. Had the decision gone against Mr. Doig, its effects would have reverberated throughout the art world, experts said. Such a decision could have set an uncomfortable precedent, potentially emboldening others to claim that a seemingly familiar painting on a living room wall was in fact by a   artist. “Other artists will be breathing a big sigh of relief,” said Nicholas M. O’Donnell, a Boston art lawyer.",0
"Hawaii renews bid to narrow Trump travel ban (Reuters) - The state of Hawaii renewed its bid to narrow President Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban, following court rulings which said the state had taken the wrong procedural approach in attempts to challenge the administration’s policy earlier this week. In a court filing late on Friday, Hawaii’s attorney general asked a Honolulu judge to issue an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible “bona fide relationship” with a U.S. person or entity. The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred.  Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Earlier this week Hawaii had asked a Honolulu judge for a court order clarifying the Supreme Court’s ruling to allow grandparents into the United States. The judge, along with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that the lower courts did not have the power to simply clarify the Supreme Court’s opinion. However, the 9th Circuit on Friday said the courts could issue an injunction against Trump’s policy in the future, if the government misapplied the Supreme Court’s ruling to a particular person or entity harmed by the travel ban. Hours after that ruling, Hawaii made such an injunction request in a Honolulu federal court. Hawaii said the state itself, along with resettlement agencies, are harmed by Trump’s guidelines because they are prevented from helping refugees move there. A Justice Department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.  The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world. ",0
"Protesters target Trump buildings in massive street rallies (CNN) For many Americans across the country, Donald Trump's victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept.

""Not my president,"" protesters chanted in rallies coast to coast.

Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight -- with demonstrations outside Trump's properties.

While most protesters were peaceful, dozens were arrested. At least three officers were wounded. And about 40 fires were set in one California city.

Here's a snapshot of the rallies across the nation:

On Thursday afternoon, more than 200 anti-Trump protesters marched from the Union Square area to Washington Square Park in Manhattan.

Some carried signs with messages such as, ""White men stop ruining everything."" They chanted, ""Trump and Pence make no sense.""

Overnight, about 5,000 people protested the real estate mogul's victory outside Trump Tower, authorities estimated. They included pop star Lady Gaga, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter.

Their concerns ranged from policies, such as Trump's proposed plan to build a wall along the US-Mexican border, to the polarizing tenor of his campaign that they say stoked xenophobic fears.

""I came out here to let go of a lot of fear that was sparked as soon as I saw the results,"" protester Nick Powers said in New York. He said he feared Trump will support stronger stop-and-frisk policies that would put many people in prison. Powers said he was also worried that Trump's victory would embolden sexist views.

At least 15 protesters at Trump Tower were arrested Wednesday night for disorderly conduct, New York police said.

About 7,000 demonstrators filled streets in Oakland on Wednesday night -- and some turned violent.

Protesters hurled Molotov cocktails, rocks and fireworks at police. Three officers were injured, police spokeswoman Johnna Watson said.

Trash fires smoldered on a highway, and a downtown business was set ablaze. By Thursday morning, emergency workers extinguished about 40 fires.

""Throughout the evening, the large group splintered into smaller groups that began vandalizing numerous businesses in the downtown area,"" Oakland police said.

At least 30 people were arrested and 11 citations were issued for vandalism, assaulting officers, unlawful assembly, failure to disperse and possession of a firearm.

Three police cars from nearby Pleasanton were damaged, officials said.

A few miles away at Berkeley High School, about 1,500 students walked out of classes Wednesday. In San Francisco, more than 1,000 students across the city walked out of the school and headed to the Civic Center to engage in a peaceful protest, according to a tweet from the San Francisco Unified School District.

""People are furious, not just at the results of the election but the rhetoric of Donald Trump,"" said Ahmed Kanna, an organizer for Social Alternative at Berkeley.

In Chicago, activists marched down Lake Shore Drive -- an eight-lane expressway along Lake Michigan -- toward the Windy City's Trump Tower.

""I still can't believe I have to protest for civil rights,"" one sign read.

CNN's Ryan Young, who saw a few thousand people there, said many chanted vulgarities toward the President-elect.

""As a nation we thought we had come so far, but it seems like we're taking many steps back,"" one woman said. ""We want to come together to change that.""

In Omaha, Nebraska, authorities deployed pepper balls on a crowd of more than 200 people protesting Trump's election after they defied police orders to stay out of the streets.

Dozens of high school and college students staged rallies near the USC and UCLA campuses.

Overnight, more than 1,000 protesters rallied outside Los Angeles City Hall, including many young Latinos.

They chanted, ""I will not live in fear,"" ""Fight back, stand up"" and ""¡Si se puede!"" (Spanish for ""Yes, it can be done"").

Protesters also set on fire a piñata depicting the head of the President-elect.

Several protesters said they feared that family or friends might be deported once Trump takes office.

Brooklyn White, an 18-year-old who voted for Clinton, held a sign that said, ""Hate won't win.""

""We can't let it stop us,"" she said. ""If he's the president, then fine. But if Donald Trump is going to be it, then he has to listen.""

As many as 3,000 people joined Wednesday's demonstrations in the city, and 28 people were arrested for running into the 101 Freeway, said Los Angeles police spokeswoman Liliana Preciado. There was some property damage, but it's too early to know the exact extent, she said.

Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement, ""I understand that the results of Tuesday's election are painful for many of us, and this kind of engagement can be a meaningful part of the healing we need after such a long and divisive campaign.

""But walking and throwing objects onto freeways is dangerous for pedestrians and drivers -- and it puts a heavy burden on people just trying make it home to their families or get to work safely.""

Garcetti emphasized that the protests were largely peaceful, but said police would take quick action against those blocking traffic on interstates or vandalizing property, including news media vans.

""There is no place for the destruction of property, for the dangerous stopping of traffic,"" he said at a press conference Thursday. ""Don't lose the message here. The message is that Los Angeles stands as the great hope.""

Garcetti said 28 protesters have been arrested.

Meanwhile, protesters in Washington chanted, ""No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA,"" as they marched downtown to the Trump International Hotel.

Elsewhere in the nation's capital, an illuminated sign proclaimed that the US is ""Better Than Bigotry.""

Trump supporters also rallied, showing their elation outside his current and future homes -- New York's Trump Tower and the White House.

Nicholas Elliot, a Georgetown University student, compared Trump's victory to the United Kingdom's Brexit vote to leave the European Union.

J.D. Vance, author of the book ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" said Trump supporters in middle America voted for him because so few people -- including Clinton or her supporters -- had paid attention to their plight.

""They see Trump as an agent of change and (an) agent of protest against folks who they feel have really failed in government,"" Vance said.

Now comes the hard part: finding middle ground, CNN's Marc Preston said.

""All that anger that has been contained outside of Washington, D.C., and New York that we don't see in middle America ... everyone's starting to see it,"" Preston said. ""There is a lot of healing that has got to happen.""",0
"Hurricane Irma likely to drop to Category 4 upon landfall in Florida: NHC (Reuters) - Hurricane Irma is likely to be downgraded to a Category 4 storm by the time it makes landfall in Florida, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Thursday. Irma, at present a Category 5 storm packing maximum sustained winds of 180 miles (285 km) per hour, is moving off the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the NHC said.   It has become a little less organized over the past few hours but the threat of direct hurricane impacts in Florida over the weekend and early next week continues to increase, it said. Hurricane watches were in effect for the northwestern Bahamas and much of Cuba. Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, killed eight people on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin and left Barbuda devastated on Thursday. Meanwhile, a hurricane swirling in the Gulf of Mexico, Katia, which is about 195 miles (310 km) northeast of Veracruz with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour (130 km per hour), is likely to gain near major hurricane strength by landfall, the NHC said. A third hurricane in the Atlantic, Jose, has strengthened slightly and is expected to intensify further over the next 48 hours, it added. Hurricane Jose is about 815 miles (1,310 km) east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour (150 km per hour), the Miami-based weather forecaster said. ",0
"Will Latino loathing of Trump drive a voter movement to swing the election? Donald Trump’s rise is spurring a backlash from Latino communities across America that has the potential to prove a formidable barrier to the billionaire’s success in the November presidential election.

From Florida to Nevada, Arizona to Iowa, and countless other states beyond, there is evidence that the sleeping giant of the Latino vote is stirring. Trump’s favorability ratings with Hispanic voters are running at historic lows, while he faces an increasingly well-organized nationwide campaign to oppose him.

A Guardian exploration of three key swing states and survey of national Hispanic outreach groups has found that the presumptive Republican nominee faces an uphill struggle to repair the damage caused by his threats to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and build a wall with Mexico.

A poll of Hispanic Americans carried out by Latino Decisions and America’s Voice in April found some 87% of Latinos felt unfavorably towards him. Significantly, almost half said they felt more enthusiastic about voting in the presidential election than they did four years ago, and 41% of those said it was because they wanted to “stop Trump”.

In Florida, groups report that new Hispanic voter registrations are running at 1,000 a week. (Some 2.6 million Hispanics are eligible to vote in Florida for this year’s general election, and about 800,000 of them have not yet registered.)

That unprecedented number corresponds – not coincidentally, Latino organizers believe – with polls that show almost nine in 10 Latino Floridians view Trump unfavorably.



In Iowa, the Latino community has been virtually silent until this year. In 2012 only 1,000 Latinos participated in the Iowa presidential caucuses; this year the number soared to 13,000 – about 25% of all registered Hispanic voters.

“Clearly they were worried about the rhetoric, specifically of Trump. We could not have mobilized the community anything like as effectively without him,” said Joe Henry of the League of United Latin American Citizens.

In Nevada, a state where almost one in five of the 1.9 million eligible voters are Latino, an aggressive push to mobilize the community has started to bear fruit among some 362,000 Latinos who are still unregistered for the November ballot.

Even in Arizona, which has voted Democratic only once in a presidential race in the past 60 years, Hispanic activists hope to bring the state into play by registering up to 75,000 first-time voters. They have already expanded by 125,000 since 2010, to a total of 536,003 registered Hispanic voters (14.4% of the overall voter pool).

“There is something new going on, something unique in the immigrant community,” said Luis Gutiérrez, a US Congress representative for parts of Chicago. “And it has something to do with the tenor and tone of the presidential race.”

To what extent Hispanic Americans will be motivated to vote by Trump’s anti-immigrant remarks is one of the great unknowns of 2016. The Latino population continues to grow at a faster pace than any other demographic, from 19.5 million eligible Latino voters in 2008 to 23.3 million in 2012, with 27.3 million projected by November. That would amount to some 12% of the nation’s electorate in 2016.

Yet the proportion who actually cast their ballot has remained stubbornly low. In 2012 it was only 48%, much lower than the figures for African Americans (66%) and whites (64%).

“The Latino vote cannot be taken for granted, even with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee,” said Sylvia Manzano, a principal of the political consulting firm Latino Decisions. “Telling Latino voters that Trump is hostile to you is one thing – getting them to the polling stations another.”

Against that backdrop of such unflexed political muscle, there are signs that 2016 may see a larger turnout. Mi Familia Vota, a not-for-profit group devoted to encouraging Hispanic participation, has reported a surge in interest in voter registration. In the first four months of this year it helped 18,450 Latinos to get on the voter rolls in six states – Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Texas.

Three of those states, Florida, Colorado and Nevada, are likely to be among the handful of battlegrounds where the outcome of the fight for the White House will be decided. Small but increasingly well-organized Latino populations in North Carolina and Virginia could also prove significant.

Outreach groups have been busily encouraging the 8.8 million Hispanic immigrants who are legal US residents to take up citizenship as the first step towards voting. Nationally, average requests for citizenship reached 65,000 every month in the five months up to January, with half the applicants being Latino. That’s a modest 15% increase on the same period in the previous year.

Non-partisan groups working to increase Hispanic political participation hope to boost that number as the presidential election looms, largely on the back of Trump’s attacks. In a normal year, some 650,000 green card holders are granted citizenship; this year the groups’ goal is one million, although with the election now six months away it is not certain how many of those the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) would be able to process in time for them to secure a vote by November.

Rocío Sáenz of the Service Employees International Union, which is part of a coalition that has helped 12,781 Latinos apply for citizenship in more than 300 “naturalization workshops” around the country, detects a new intensity: “There is a sense of urgency as a result of the hateful rhetoric about mass deportations, building walls, calling us criminals – this is personal for us.”

Guardian reporters in three key states sought to answer the increasingly critical question: is 2016 the year the sleeping giant of the Hispanic vote wakes up?

It’s impossible to overstate the importance of Florida: it has (officially at least) sided with the winning presidential candidate in every election since 1996. All of the contests have been close, with Obama taking the state in both his presidential runs by fewer than three percentage points.



That paper-thin margin is vastly overshadowed by the potential of the Floridian Hispanic population – 24% of the total today, up from 17% in 2000. At the same time, the political affiliation of Latinos in the state has been drifting steadily towards the Democratic party, largely as a result of the influx of left-leaning Puerto Ricans to central Florida.

When you add in the Trump effect, the billionaire’s prospects appear particularly bleak in Florida where recent polls indicate that close to 90% of Hispanic voters view him unfavorably.

Latinos are registering to vote in “unprecedented” numbers to oppose him, advocacy groups say.

“There’s a lot of Latinos who are very angry with Trump,” said Vivian Rodriguez, president of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida. “That’s created a wave of Latinos who want to get citizenship and get things going to vote in this election cycle.”

The most recent figures from Florida’s division of elections showed that 1.8 million Hispanics registered to vote in February’s primaries, almost 150,000 more than the number who voted in the 2012 general election, when Obama carried the state with more than 60% of the Hispanic vote.

With the number of Hispanics who registered for the Florida primary already so high, the figures suggest there may be an extraordinarily large turnout of Latinos for the general election in November. In 2012, the increase in registered Hispanic voters after the primary was 110,000. This year, the indications are it will be much greater.



A record 2.6 million Hispanics are eligible to vote in Florida, an increase of half a million since 2012 boosted significantly by the mass influx of Puerto Rican US citizens, particularly around Kissimmee and Orlando, seeking to escape the worsening economic conditions in their homeland.



That leaves about 800,000 eligible Hispanic voters who have not yet registered and if the feedback being received by the many outreach groups in the state is accurate – the National Council of La Raza alone told the Guardian it was signing up new Hispanic voters at a rate of about 1,000 a week – not many of them are going to be supporting Donald Trump.

“Latinos are going to be voting in unprecedented numbers against the villains, the politicians who dehumanize immigrant families to score political points,” said Maria Rodriguez, executive director of FLIC Votes (Florida Immigrant Action Committee).

“We’ve already been seeing the trend of a new generation of younger Cuban Americans registering as Democrats. There’s going to be an exodus from the Republican party; lots of Latino Republicans are going to switch to no party affiliation or the Democrats.”

One of those is Luis-Carlos Fumero, a Miami-born Cuban who fits kitchens for his uncle’s condo renovation company and who fervently supported Mitt Romney’s unsuccessful 2012 campaign. This time he says he will not vote.

“I cannot support this man,” said Fumero, 25, of Trump. “This nonsense over the wall, not letting Muslims into America, what he says about Mexicans and about women, this man is loco.”

The loss of support from Miami’s Cuban Americans could be a body blow to Trump’s hopes of carrying Florida in the general election. Historically a bulwark of Republican support, the influence of Florida’s Cuban voting bloc has already waned from 46% of the state’s eligible Hispanic voters in 1990 to barely 30% today, according to Pew research.

Now there are clear signs that even that bloc might desert the Republican candidate, under the weight of Obama’s opening up of trade and travel with Cuba and with the rise of a younger generation of Cuban Americans who are less ideologically driven.

In February’s primary, the heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade was the only county in Florida that Trump lost, and although he led Hillary Clinton 41-29 among Miami’s Cuban Americans in a Bendixen and Amandi poll this month, his support level is still far below the 64% Romney received from Cuban Americans statewide in 2012.

Perhaps more worryingly for Trump, Miami’s influential Republican Cuban American political leaders continue to speak out against him. House representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo have said they cannot vote for him, and Tomás Regalado, the mayor of Miami and himself a Cuban exile, launched a searing attack on the presumptive nominee in the Miami Herald.

“He mistreats people, speaks derisively of people,” Regalado said. “A president’s biggest asset is the bully pulpit. This guy is capable of creating national and international chaos.”

Karina Ruiz de Diaz, president of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition, takes the long view. “The Latino vote is still very young,” she told the Guardian. “We will reshape the state, it’s just going to take a little bit of time.”

Arizona’s electorate is in the midst of rapid change. One in five eligible voters in the state are Hispanic, according to a recent analysis by the Pew Research Center. It estimates that 1.3 million Arizona Latinos will be eligible to vote in 2016, up from 796,000 in 2008.

Young Latinos make up a large share of the Hispanic electorate. Nearly twice as many Hispanic voters in Arizona are millennials, compared with their white counterparts, according to 2014 Pew data.

Arizona has historically been a conservative state. But the changing demographics and the prospective general election race between Trump and Clinton has activists and experts predicting that this will be the year Arizona Latinos realize their political force, and sweep Democrats in to power.

“It’s exciting for us in Arizona because we keep getting talked about as a purple state, as possibly a swing state,” said Kate Gallego, the vice-mayor of Phoenix.

That would be astonishing. Since the second world war, Arizona has only once voted for the Democratic presidential candidate: Bill Clinton in 1996. So could it happen?

“Certainly John McCain thinks so,” Gallego said, referring to comments recorded at a private fundraiser in which the long-serving Arizona senator said Trump could threaten his chances of being re-elected. “If Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona, with over 30% of the vote being the Hispanic vote, no doubt that this may be the race of my life,” McCain is reported to have said.

Yet even if record turnout were to turn the solidly red state blue, Arizona’s 11 electoral votes would probably be superfluous as the outcome is unlikely to shift the dynamics of the race.

If Trump is to be the motivation that finally unleashes the electoral power of Arizona’s Latinos, the achievement will not be his alone. He will also have to credit the assistance of two of his most ardent supporters: Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, the self-styled “toughest sheriff in America”, and Jan Brewer, the former Arizona governor who signed into law one of the harshest state immigration measures in the country.

In 2010, Arizona enacted Senate Bill 1070, a draconian law aimed at driving out the state’s undocumented immigrants that pushed the state to the forefront of an acrimonious debate over border security and comprehensive immigration reform.

Yet instead of disappearing, the law drew many of the state’s undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. Latinos joined forces with business leaders, concerned about the economic impact of the law. Together, tens of thousands marched through the streets of downtown Phoenix in opposition.

“We have seen many Trumps in Arizona,” said Ian Danley, a director with One Arizona, speaking after a meeting on voter suppression in Phoenix. “We were birthed out of SB 1070, which is a Trump-like policy. We weren’t prepared in 2010. We’re prepared now.”

One Arizona, a non-partisan network of Hispanic and immigrant groups working to increase Latino voter turnout in the state, has registered between 110,000 and 125,000 new voters since 2010, and helped triple the number of Latinos enrolled in the state’s early voting system. Now the network has set itself the ambitious target of registering between 60,000 and 75,000 new voters by November.

Because volunteers are restricted from telling registrants who to vote for and the group doesn’t track registrants’ party affiliation, it’s hard to assess “the Trump effect”. Anecdotally, several volunteers said it was not uncommon for registrants to ask which party Trump belonged to and then tick the opposite box.

“People are paying a lot of attention,” said Raquel Terán, the state director for Mi Vota Familia, sipping vegan horchata at a coffee shop in downtown Phoenix.

When Donald Trump came to Arizona in March, he held his rally in Fountain Hills, a predominantly white town in Maricopa County. He was joined by Brewer, the former governor, and introduced by Arpaio, the controversial sheriff who has cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in an ongoing racial profiling case that found his officers had targeted Latinos during raids and traffic stops.

“We had a little problem. Some demonstrators were trying to disrupt,” Arpaio told the crowd, which began to boo and hiss. “If they think they’re going to intimidate you and the next president of the United States, it’s not going to happen – not in this town!”

“I call that the hate and fear playbook,” said Petra Falcon, a long-time Arizona activist and director of the rights group Promise Arizona. “If you want to divide a country or a state, just take out that playbook and start talking about the harm immigrants do – they come here to take your jobs. They rob. He took that playbook from Arizona and is using it nationally.”

The biggest challenge for Arizona’s Democrats remains voter turnout. There are approximately 170,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats in the state, according to the latest data from the secretary of state’s office.

In the primaries on 22 March, 55% of Republicans cast ballots, compared with 49% of Democrats. However, registered independents, who make up the largest share of Arizona voters but are not represented by a party, could not vote in either primary.

At an outlet mall in Tempe, José Barboza and Francis Sullivan of Promise Arizona took turns approaching shoppers and sales associates with their clipboards.

Jaritma Avilez told Barboza she was registered to vote and he moved on. But later Avilez admitted to the Guardian that even though she was registered, she didn’t plan on voting in November. “I don’t feel like politics really affects my life,” she shrugged.

“In November, the Latino community is going to come out in large numbers,” Jocelyn Sida, a Nevada organizer for Mi Familia Vota, which works to increase Hispanic turnout, told the Guardian. “A lot of millennials like myself are getting involved in leadership roles to educate and engage the community, and it’s been very accepting. They’re not withdrawing, they’re not closing their doors to us. On the contrary they’re seeking us out to find ways to get involved.”

With 17% of Nevada’s electorate being Hispanic, the Latino vote certainly has the potential to deny Trump victory through strong turnout. In 2012, 70% of Nevada Latinos voted for Obama, helping him to win the state by a comfortable six-point margin.

“All the time Trump’s yelling about kicking people out the country. It’s horrible,” said Rodulfo Martinez, 60, a Las Vegas construction worker, expressing an anger felt by many. “The way he insults us isn’t right. Many of the things he says about the [border] wall and why Latinos come here don’t make sense.”

A poll last month by Latino Decisions showed that immigration reform was the most pressing issue for Nevada Hispanics. The state has the country’s largest percentage of undocumented immigrants, many of whom count registered voters as friends and family.

“Está loco,” said Vicky Legaspi, 36, echoing Fumero in Miami. A restaurant owner on Las Vegas’s working-class east side, Legaspi nearly choked on a spoon of ice cream when asked if she would vote for the celebrity businessman. “He just wants attention. He doesn’t care about this country.”

Ana Hernandez, 34, a housekeeper, said Trump was “mean” and “has a bad heart” and that she intended to vote for Clinton because “first of all, she’s not a racist”, setting a somewhat low bar.

Latino participation in Nevada’s 2016 Democratic caucus showed a 5% uptick over the 2008 contest, another encouraging sign for Clinton, who won the vote in both cycles. The primary season also saw Democrats build a 5% lead in voter registration in Nevada, while an ongoing “naturalization blitz” organized by progressive groups has brought thousands of new minority voters into the fray.

At the start of this election season, Nevada had 362,000 potential new Latino voters, including 42,000 Hispanic youth who will come of voting age this cycle and 40,000 legal permanent residents eligible for citizenship, according to Mi Familia Vota.

“It’s amazing to hear from people who never had a reason to vote, or speaking of the citizenship workshops, people who have never had a reason to become citizens until now,” said Laura Martin, associate director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada (Plan), which promotes civic engagement. “We focus on low-income communities of color, so we meet lots of people at the bus station, the welfare office, or outside the dollar store. They used to not care, but now they see Donald Trump and that’s scary to them.”

"U.N. envoy urges Security Council to visit Myanmar, Bangladesh UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A top U.N. official recounted to the Security Council on Tuesday  heartbreaking and horrific accounts of sexual atrocities  by Myanmar soldiers against Rohingya Muslim women, urging the body to visit the region and demand an end to attacks on civilians.  Pramila Patten, special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on sexual violence in conflict, said one woman told her she was held by Myanmar troops for 45 days and raped repeatedly, while another woman could no longer see out of one eye after it was bitten by a soldier during a sexual assault.  Some witnesses reported women and girls being tied to either a rock or a tree before multiple soldiers raped them to death,  Patten told the Security Council.   Some women recounted how soldiers drowned babies in the village well. A few women told me how their own babies were allegedly thrown in the fire as they were dragged away by soldiers and gang raped,  she said.  Patten said the 15-member Security Council should visit Myanmar - also known as Burma - and Cox s Bazar in Bangladesh, where more than 626,000 refugees have fled to since violence erupted in Myanmar s northern Rakhine State on Aug. 25.  She said that a Security Council resolution demanding an immediate end to violations against civilians in Rakhine state and outlining measures to hold the perpetrators accountable  would send an important signal.  Myanmar s army released a report last month denying all allegations of rapes and killings by security forces.  This is unacceptable,  said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.  Burma must allow an independent, transparent and credible investigation into what has happened.   While we are hearing promises from the government of Burma, we need to see action,  she said.     Myanmar has been stung by international criticism for the way its security forces responded to Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants on 30 security posts. Last month the Security Council urged the Myanmar government to  ensure no further excessive use of military force in Rakhine state.  China s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Wu Haitao said the crisis had to be solved through an agreement between Myanmar and Bangladesh and warned that any solution  reached under strong pressure from outside may ease the situation temporarily but will leave negative after effects.   The two countries signed an agreement on voluntary repatriation Nov. 23. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman pushed on Tuesday for the United Nations to be involved in any operation to return Rohingya.   Plans alone are not sufficient. We hope Myanmar will draw upon the wealth of expertise the U.N. can offer,  Feltman told the Security Council.  ",0

"Obama Lists Regrets -- Again: Failure to Secure Gun Control Still #1 In a January 4 “exit letter” to the American people, President Obama again listed what he regrets most about the last eight years. Number one on the list was his failure to secure gun control. [Obama shared this same regret with CNN in early December 2016, and the BBC quoted him in July 2015 speaking about the “distressing” failure to secure gun control.  On Wednesday, he used the letter to highlight his regrets once more. After listing numerous things he views as achievements —  such as shifting from coal to solar power, pulling out of Iraq, pulling out of Afghanistan, and securing Obamacare —  Obama wrote: Still, through every victory and every setback, I’ve insisted that change is never easy, and never quick that we wouldn’t meet all of our challenges in one term, or one presidency, or even in one lifetime. And for all that we’ve achieved, there’s still so much I wish we’d been able to do, from enacting gun safety measures to protect more of our kids and our cops from mass shootings like Newtown, to passing commonsense immigration reform that encourages the best and brightest from around the world to study, stay, and create jobs in America. Regardless of whether a gun control group or an individual gun controller like Obama raises the topic, it is notable that no gun law would have prevented the Newtown, Connecticut, attack against Sandy Hook Elementary School. It is especially notable that the gun controls President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Senator Joe Manchin ( ) pushed in the wake of Sandy Hook would have done nothing to prevent another Sandy Hook. Manchin touted an expansion of background checks in reaction to the Sandy Hook attack. And then, just days before the Senate rejected the gun controls, he admitted that his proposal would not have prevented the attack. Isolated Sandy   attacks continued around the country during the last four years of Obama’s presidency, and background checks would not have stopped one of them. But nearly all of them could have been reduced —  or perhaps prevented altogether —  by changing the one commonality many of them shared: namely, policies that mandate the disarmament of   citizens in certain buildings   locations.

"Pope urges Trump to show concern for poor, be guided by ethical values VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged U.S. President Donald Trump to be guided by ethical values and as he took office on Friday, saying he must take care of the poor and the outcast during his time in office. “At a time when our human family is beset by grave humanitarian crises demanding farsighted and united political responses, I pray that your decisions will be guided by the rich spiritual and ethical values that have shaped the history of the American people and your nation’s commitment to the advancement of human dignity and freedom worldwide,” Francis said in a message sent to Trump minutes after he was inaugurated. “Under your leadership, may America’s stature continue to be measured above all by its concern for the poor, the outcast and those in need ...,” Francis said in the message released by the Vatican. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, has made concern for the poor and the weakest members of society a key platform of his nearly four-year-old papacy. Last year, in response to an answer about Trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall on the border with Mexico, Francis said a man with those views is “not Christian”. Trump struck back, calling the pope’s comments “disgraceful.”          ",0

[The piece, written by Shakeer Rahman and Robin Steinberg, slams New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for not going far enough when it comes to obstructing federal immigration officers from deporting illegal aliens:  The abruptness of the raids provoked criticism from local officials, including Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who vowed to stand with immigrant communities. But mass deportation under President Trump will also happen through a more routine policy that is in the mayor’s control: endless, unnecessary arrests for   offenses, which end up feeding immigrants into the federal government’s deportation machine. It’s not enough for cities like New York to declare themselves “sanctuaries,” which simply means that the local police won’t detain noncitizens on the federal government’s behalf. If cities really want to protect immigrants, they must also end the   style of policing that makes immigrants the victims of unnecessary arrests and disproportionate punishment. Many of these unnecessary arrests stem from the discredited idea that a draconian crackdown on the most minor offenses  —   littering, selling loose cigarettes, biking on the sidewalk  —   will prevent more serious crimes. This model of policing, known as broken windows or zero tolerance, helped to drive mass incarceration. Its next cost could be mass deportation. The   then decries the idea that illegal aliens can be deported for “minor offenses like simple marijuana possession” or any “crime involving moral turpitude,” despite that policy seeming to have not changed at least over the last decade. ICE agents were also attacked in the   with Rahman and Steinberg writing, “Even if cities stop sharing arrest information, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been known to send plainclothes agents to local courts, where they wait for immigrants to appear for misdemeanor charges. ” The   goes on to say that Trump’s deportation effort of illegal immigrants, specifically those who have committed crimes, “can’t happen without boots on the ground,” though ICE has long used agents to investigate, arrest and deport criminals. “Until cities reject the failed thinking that led to mass incarceration, local police and prosecutors will be doing the legwork for mass deportation,” the   concludes.

"Factbox: Five facts about Mike Pence, Trump's running mate pick (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump will name Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate on Friday, U.S. news organizations reported on Thursday. Here are five facts about Pence, a Republican who previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives: Pence did not initially support Trump. Shortly before Indiana’s Republican primary election in May, Pence endorsed Trump’s rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Pence praised Trump at the time, but he compared Cruz to former Republican President Ronald Reagan and called him a “principled conservative.” Trump won the state anyway, and Cruz dropped out of the Republican race. Trump and Pence have since met to discuss the running mate position. WELL-CONNECTED WITH DONORS Pence has strong ties to billionaire donors Charles and David Koch, including current and former staff members who have worked for them. After saying he was primarily self-funding his campaign during the Republican primaries, Trump has been holding fundraisers during the general election, with support from the Republican National Committee. The New York businessman comes to the money race at a considerable disadvantage, however, compared with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Pence sometimes describes himself as “a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.” Pence in 2015 signed a religious freedom law that critics said opened the door to anti-gay discrimination. When he was in Congress, he opposed repealing the military’s “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy on sexual orientation. He also has pushed restrictive abortion regulations and has pushed for Congress to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit women’s health provider that performs some abortions. He was a vocal opponent of the 2008 Wall Street bailout. In September 2008, Pence, then a U.S. House member, argued against the $700 billion package to stabilize the U.S. financial system, saying it would “nationalize almost every bad mortgage in America.”  Pence also said the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation passed in 2010 would hurt jobs. Trump has vowed to dismantle Dodd-Frank, though he has not said how he would replace it. Pence opposed allowing Syrian refugees coming to the United States to settle in Indiana. In November 2015, the governor directed state agencies to suspend the resettlement of Syrians there. A family that was supposed to arrive in December was instead sent to Connecticut. A federal judge later ruled the order “clearly discriminates” against refugees from a particular country. However, Pence tweeted disapproval in 2015 for plans to ban Muslims from entering the United States, an idea Trump has advocated. Pence called it “offensive and unconstitutional.” ",0
"In the United States, anxiety is up, but crime is down Felony crime declined nationwide in 2015, continuing a historic drop. But mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., and Charleston, S.C. – as well as a slight uptick in the number of murders – have contributed to the feeling of unease.

Latonya Jones holds a photo of her mother, Bettie Jones, during a vigil on Sunday, in Chicago. Jones, an antiviolence activist and mother of five, was accidentally killed early Saturday by officers responding to a domestic disturbance on the city’s West Side, police said.

Earlier this month, when New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton told fellow officers that 2015 will end up being the safest year ever in New York City history, he paused to note that it was also “a year of great contradictions.”

Despite the fact that the nation’s largest city is still experiencing historic drops in crime, Commissioner Bratton’s tone was somber: Four police officers had died in the line of duty since this time last year, making the latest crime statistics ring somewhat hollow in a “terrible” year for the NYPD.

And such is the mood across the nation, in many ways. A study at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University found that overall crime was still declining throughout the United States a bit in 2015. Felony crime declined 1.5 percent nationwide, and dropped by roughly 2 percent in New York. But the highly visible violence of the past year – such as mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif.; Roseburg, Ore; and Charleston, S.C. – as well as a slight uptick in the number of murders, has contributed to the feeling of great contradictions when it comes to crime.

Indeed, 7 in 10 Americans said they believed there was more crime in the US this year than last, according to a Gallup poll in October, up from 2014. That’s despite the fact that the nation’s crime rates have plummeted over the past two decades. But as the polling center noted about its annual survey, “Americans' perceptions of crime … are not always on par with reality.”

“The public's perception of media coverage certainly gives a skewed image of what's going on with crime,” said Matthew Freidman, an economist with the Brennan Center in New York and coauthor of the study, to NPR last week. “What we find is that though we've seen a nearly three-decades-long decline in crime rates, public perception does not match that.”

The rise of social media and the 24-hour digital news cycle, as well as the high-profile nature of some of the deaths, may play into that.

For example, last December, two NYPD officers were gunned down in their patrol cars – randomly targeted by a man who said he wanted revenge for the shootings of black men. A sheriff’s deputy in Texas was shot at a gas station in August, and many police officers say they have felt under siege over the past year. However, there were 39 officers shot and killed so far in 2015 – a drop from 2014, when 47 were shot and killed, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.

At the same, concerns about the number of people shot by police or who died in custody continues to create a climate of tension throughout the country. From the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore to the shooting of a black teen and the accidental killing of a black mother and activist in Chicago over the weekend, it has been a year in which violence has drawn much of the nation’s attention.

It is true that many cities saw a rise in the number of murders this year. In New York, there were 339 as of Christmas Day – slightly more than last year’s all-time low of 333, but still well below the 536 murders recorded in 2010.

However, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston are each projected to see double-digit increases in their murder rates this year. In Baltimore, Milwaukee, and St. Louis, rates have reached levels not seen since the 1990s, studies have found.

But scholars point out that despite such spikes this year, such statistics do not yet indicate a reversal in the dramatic drop in violence in the US over the past few decades, and can be attributed to normal variations in annual numbers. The overall crime rate is still half what it was in 1990, and nearly a quarter of what it was in 2000.

“The increase in the murder rate is insufficient to drive up the crime rate, and using murder as a proxy for crime overall is mistaken,” the Brennan study notes. “It is important to remember just how much crime has fallen in the last 25 years.”

But tensions remain high, fueled in part by the terror attacks in San Bernardino and Paris. Some 40 percent of Americans say that they believe the terrorists are winning – more than at any time after 9/11 – according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday.

With the rise of the Black Lives Matter protest movement calling for an end to policing policies that activists say unfairly target minorities, many continue to perceive a “year of great contradictions.” Since last year, some high-profile deaths of black men and some women at police hands have prompted continued clashes and a feeling of unease within the nation’s law enforcement systems and the communities they serve.

In Chicago, police shot and killed two black people over the holiday weekend, including a 55-year-old mother of five and antiviolence activist who was accidentally killed after officers responded to a domestic disturbance by an emotionally disturbed college student.

The shootings come just a month after the Justice Department began an investigation of the Chicago Police Department after the release of a video showing the shooting death of a black teen last year. The video led to murder charges for the white police officer who shot the teen and the resignation of the city’s police commissioner.

By contrast, on Monday, a grand jury in Cleveland declined to bring charges against either of the two officers involved in the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft gun in a park at the time he was shot.

In New York, like the rest of the country, many report a growing sense of anxiety about crime and policing. But in the past five years, crime continued to fall, even as police have made dramatically fewer arrests.

New York City police arrested about 333,000 people through Dec. 20, The New York Times reported, down 13 percent from the 385,000 arrested last year. And these numbers are way down from the 423,000 arrests made in 2010.

So despite the fact that 2015 has been in many ways a rough and contradictory year, police officials are optimistic as both overall crime and the number of arrests continue to fall.

“This is going to be, potentially, a very significant year in terms of the history of index crime in New York City,” Dermot Shea, deputy commissioner of operations for the NYPD, told the Times.",0

"Kurdish leader Barzani condemns Iraqi parliament vote to remove Kirkuk governor: Kurdish media (Reuters) - Kurdish President Massoud Barzani condemned the vote by Iraq s parliament to remove the governor of Kirkuk from office on Thursday, according to local media reports. Speaking at a pro-referendum rally in Zakho, a city in Iraq s autonomous region of Kurdistan, Barzani said that Baghdad had left no room for negotiations over the independence referendum, according to Kurdish TV channel Kurdistan 24.   The decision to remove the governor, Najmaddin Kareem, comes after Kirkuk - an oil-rich province claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq - voted to take part in a referendum set for Sept. 25 on Kurdish independence. The governor has said he will stay in office. ",0
"MILO and Pamela Geller Protest Sharia-Advocate Linda Sarsour in NYC - Breitbart Former Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos and Pamela Geller held a protest against   Linda Sarsour’s speaking engagement at The City University of New York (CUNY) on Thursday.[  Calling out CUNY chancellor James Milliken for making Sarsour the keynote speaker at the commencement address, Geller started by claiming, “First of all, this is not about free speech. ” “I’m a free speech activist. Linda Sarsour is free to speak on college campuses and does frequently,” she continued. “The idea of inviting her to keynote the commencement address, those invitations are bestowed upon people to enhance a college’s reputation. Why would you hold her up as a role model? As Representative Carolyn Maloney said, ‘surely CUNY can do better?’ The norming of evil and terror and Jew hatred, surely CUNY can do better?” “She’s earned a reputation as one of this country’s most vicious   activists, she has called Netanyahu a ‘waste of skin’. She tweeted a picture of a young Muslim child throwing a rock at Jews, calling him the definition of courage. Surely CUNY can do better?” continued Geller. “She’s the leader of the Boycott Divestment movement, which is   in its calls for the boycott of the Jewish state. These boycotts are illegal, and inhumane. The German’s boycotted   businesses, this was a direct antecedent to the Boycott Divestment movement. Surely CUNY can do better?” Continuing her speech to applause, Geller added that Sarsour “has partnered with Rasmea Odeh, a convicted terrorist who killed students at Hebrew University, and threatened to bomb the British consulate. Surely CUNY can do better?” “Linda Sarsour was outraged when police and an FBI agent killed a jihadi, who was on his way to behead me. She said it was police violence. She said that at the end of the day, a black man was shot at a bus stop on his way to work. Beheading me is work for the jihadi  …     Surely CUNY can do better?” Sarsour declared. “She’s an open supporter of the Sharia, she says a Jew cannot be a feminist, but she says nothing about Islamic honor violence, gender apartheid, female genital mutilation, and the oppression of women under Islam. Surely CUNY can do better?” “Sarsour said that the   underwear bomber, who tried to detonate a bomb on an airplane in 2009, was a CIA plot in America’s war on Islam. Surely CUNY can do better?” concluded Geller. “She has solicited funds for Hamas. Surely CUNY can do better?  …     Anyone who tells you that this is Islamophobia, I want to quote Christopher Hitchens: ‘Islamophobia is a word created by fascists, used by cowards, to manipulate morons,’ and the morons are to my left. Silence is affirmation, we will not be silent, resist. ” Assemblyman Dov Hikind followed Geller onstage, declaring simply that “Linda Sarsour supports terrorism. ” “Let us talk about her record, that’s all we’re interested in doing,” he proclaimed. “The fact that she’s a woman is not an issue of course. The fact that she’s a Muslim, is not the issue. That is not the issue. The fact that she is Palestinian is not the issue. That is not the issue. That’s what Linda Sarsour wants people to believe. When CUNY invites Linda Sarsour to be the commencement speaker, that is something that’s imposed upon the students  …     When CUNY imposes Linda Sarsour on the students, that’s outrageous. Shame on CUNY. ” Hikind continued to display a picture of the two victims of Rasmea Odeh, who was jailed for terrorist attacks in Israel, adding, “Linda Sarsour thinks Rasmea Odeh is a great hero. ” Other speakers included Nonie Darwish from Former Muslims United, who detailed her escape from Sharia law, and David Wood, who spoke about the indoctrination of young people before Milo took to the stage. “I notice there aren’t that many Muslim protesters, but if you’ve ever tried to walk in a sodden burka, you’ll know why,” joked Milo, referencing the rain. “It’s enough to dissuade even the most determined jihadi. ” “Now we all agree on a few things, don’t we? We all agree for instance that Linda Sarsour is a       ticking   of progressive horror,” he continued. “We agree on that. Now I’ll call her Linda, because her surname Sarsour, did you know this, it means cockroach in Arabic, and I do so hate to be disrespectful. So we’ll call her Linda. ” “Yes, I’m back, and just as much of a waspish c*nt as ever. This week, another Muslim loser, a friend of Linda’s probably, strapped a bomb to his chest in Manchester and murdered over 20 people, including children,” Milo stated. “Does Linda Sarsour in her dark hut approve of this atrocity? If she feels any remorse at all, maybe its for the Muslim grooming gangs and Pakistani child rapists who have 20 fewer victims this week. What Manchester has done is once again raise the stakes. ” Milo continued to declare that “It’s now more important than ever to fight Islam in America and particularly its emissaries like Linda Sarsour,” before explaining the importance of America hearing bad ideas. He made it clear that he did not want Sarsour banned from speaking but that she must be held accountable for her views:   I believe that Linda Sarsour should be allowed to speak at CUNY. In fact, if they’d asked me, I would’ve paid her fee, no matter how many goats she asked for. And the reason that I think she should be allowed to speak is that her words, odious as they are, should be broadcast far and wide. The best response to authoritarianism is not more censorship, but more speech. I want America to hear her. I want America to listen to her arguments and weigh their merits. I am a free speech fundamentalist. I believe that in an open marketplace of ideas, the best ideas prevail. In America you don’t have an open marketplace of ideas, because the massed ranks of the establishment media, academia, and the entertainment industry are set up to condemn conservative and libertarian points of view as hateful, bigoted, and oppressive. They are none of those things. And so one of the real enemies here isn’t just ordinary Muslims. It isn’t Linda Sarsour. The bigger enemy, and the enemy to American freedom has always been from within. The enemy here are the progressive elites who run the entertainment industry, academia, and the media in this country. It is only through the open marketplace of ideas, with no more censorship of conservatives and libertarians, and no more oppressive speech codes from the left, that I believe America can realize its promise and its destiny, and that is why this country is the greatest country in the history of human civilization. That is why we are out here, in the pouring rain, because this stuff f*cking matters. And when we reach that goal, when we reach that day, when there is a full, free, frank, open exchange of ideas, when anyone can present their ideas to scrutiny, when anyone can present their system of belief, for discussion and debate, then people will see Linda Sarsour for what she is. It’s true that her ideology is as ugly as Chelsea Clinton, it’s true that Linda wants to replace graduated women’s mortar boards with hijabs, and when that happens the burka will replace those graduation robes  . Linda wants to substitute prayer rugs for diplomas, and CUNY is going right along with her. It’s true CUNY is going to see the consequences of this. They’re going to see it in enrollment, they’re going to see it in alumni donations. And the other speakers here have done a much better job than me of explaining why she is wrong about absolutely everything. So if you disagree with a     commencement speaker, hold back on giving money to this university. Don’t enroll your kids. Teach them a lesson the American way, which is with your speech and with your wallet. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

"As Trump targets immigrants, U.S. farm sector looks to automate  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Convincing big U.S. dairy owners to buy robots to milk their cows - and reduce the farmhands they employ - used to be a tough sell for Steve Fried. Recently, his job has gotten easier, he says, in part because of President Donald Trump.  “I get calls on a daily basis and it typically starts with, ‘I don’t want to deal with this labor headache any more’,” said Fried, sales manager for Lely North America, which makes robotic dairy milking and feeding systems.  Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration through stepped-up arrests and border enforcement has shaken the U.S. agricultural sector, where as many as 7 in 10 farm workers are undocumented, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.  In addition, Republican lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation that would require all employers to check social security numbers against federal databases to ensure their workers are in the country legally, something that is now voluntary in all but a handful of states.  The get-tough approach ""has created a great deal of anxiety,"" said Tom Vilsack, chief executive of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, who was U.S. Agriculture Secretary for eight years under President Barack Obama.    The shift comes as the industry was already struggling to cope with a shrinking, aging workforce. That is ratcheting up pressure on the sector to embrace new technology.  Farmers and food companies increasingly are moving to automate dairy operations, chicken processing, crop production and harvesting. Even delicate crops such as strawberries and peaches are being considered for mechanization.  “You’d be a fool to not have a plan that moves you that way,” said Duff Bevill, who owns a vineyard management company in Sonoma County, California.  Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, (PPC.O) the second largest U.S. chicken producer, this year cited a tightening migrant labor market as key to its decision to invest in robots and X-ray technology for its slaughterhouses. The goal: to swap human hands for machines that can debone the front half of chickens and perform other chores.  “We’re investing heavily in automating our processes, taking labor out and making jobs easier,” Pilgrim’s CEO William Lovette said in an earnings call. He said the company also decided to increases wages.  In Gilroy, California, Christopher Ranch is likewise embracing new machinery. The largest North American producer of fresh garlic, Christopher Ranch will spend about $1 million this year for a new Spanish-made robot in its packing plant that inserts garlic heads into sleeves, according to Ken Christopher, vice president of the family-owned business.  A 2014 report by WinterGreen Research forecast significant growth in the use of robotics in “every aspect of farming, milking, food production” and other agricultural enterprises. The report put the market for agricultural robots at $817 million in 2013 and projected that it would reach $16.3 billion by 2020.  Sensing opportunity, investors are stepping up to address agriculture’s labor squeeze with new automation, helped by falling electronics costs and advancements in software, robotics and artificial intelligence.  Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), this year spearheaded a $10 million investment in Abundant Robotics, which is working on an apple-picking robot. It also participated in a $20 million funding round for Bowery Farming, which uses robotics to grow leafy greens indoors.  Elsewhere, farm machinery maker Deere & Co (DE.N) announced that it spent $305 million to buy precision weed-killing robot maker Blue River Technology. INCENTIVES TO AUTOMATE  While little official data exists to illustrate the impact of Trump’s immigration policies on farm laborers, there is no question that illegal migration is down sharply since he took office in late January.  The number of people caught trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico dropped almost 60 percent between February and May compared the same period last year, according to government figures. Between late January to early September, the number of individuals arrested in the interior of the country by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rose almost 43 percent over the same period in 2016.  Gary Wishnatzki, a third-generation strawberry farmer in Florida, says scarce labor convinced him to raise $5 million so far to build a robotic strawberry picker that he hopes someday will reduce his industry’s need for field hands.  Bruce Taylor, CEO of Taylor Farms, a Salinas, California producer of salads and chopped vegetables for stores and restaurants, says his company has automated 20 percent of its packing plant.  The company has also teamed with an equipment maker to build a mechanized romaine harvester that is currently in use, and it is exploring automation for iceberg lettuce, broccoli and other field crops, Taylor said.  In the meantime, farmers are raising wages. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s most recent farm labor report shows average wages during the week of April 9 to 15 were $13.23 per hour, up 4 percent from the same week a year ago.  “The mantra in agriculture right now is automate what you can and pay well for the labor you absolutely have to have,” said Paul Pittman, CEO of Farmland Partners Inc, (FPI.N) a real estate investment trust that invests in North American farm land.  To win the loyalty of its full-time production workers, garlic grower Christopher Ranch decided to raise pay by 50 percent between 2016 and 2018, getting a four-year jump on California’s mandated $15 minimum wage that will take effect in 2022.  “Companies need to find ways of adapting and adjusting,” Christopher, the executive, said. “We’re going to take a small financial hit, but we’re going to be ready.”  Follow Trump’s impact on energy, environment, healthcare, immigration and the economy at The Trump Effect  www.reuters.com/trump-effect ",0
"Murdoch's UK paper arm admits computer hacking, fuelling criticism of Sky takeover LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch s British newspaper group said on Friday one of its titles had hacked the computer of a former intelligence officer, an admission which critics said showed why his takeover of European broadcaster Sky should be blocked. In a hearing at London s High Court, Murdoch s News Group Newspapers admitted  vicarious liability  for the hacking of computers belonging to Ian Hurst, who worked for British military intelligence. The case comes a month after Britain s media minister said regulators should scrutinize Murdoch s planned $15 billion takeover of Sky over concerns about broadcasting standards and its impact on media plurality. Hurst s lawyer Jeremy Reed said in a court statement the Irish edition of the News of the World newspaper had hired a private investigator to intercept his client s emails in 2006.  Hurst had served in Northern Ireland and later wrote a book about his experiences, including details of Britain s top spy in the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Alfredo Scappaticci, known by the codename  Stakeknife .  Reed said it was likely he was targeted because an employee of the newspaper wanted to trace Scappaticci.  I confirm that News Group Newspapers ... accepts vicarious liability for the wrongful acts of computer interception,  said Anthony Hudson, the lawyer for the newspaper group, adding it had paid  substantial  damages to Hurst and his family.  News Group Newspapers accepts that such activity happened, accepts that it should never have happened, and has undertaken to the court that it will never happen again.  Opponents of Murdoch s takeover said the case was evidence the deal should not be allowed to go through and they would send a dossier to the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) which is examining the proposed deal.  It s vital that the CMA is able to take this new evidence of criminality and corporate failure into account as it assesses the Murdochs  bid to take over Sky,  said Tom Watson, deputy leader of Britain s opposition Labour Party.      Murdoch shut the News of the World in 2011 after its journalists were found to have been involved in widespread phone-hacking.    His original attempt to buy full control of Sky was ditched in the wake of the scandal. Since then the company has been split in two, separating the newspapers from entertainment assets to help to smooth the deal s passage. Last month Murdoch s son James said he was confident regulators would assess the deal on its merits and not be swayed by those with grievances against his father s newspapers, saying the company had dealt effectively with past problems.

"German industry see FDP revival boosting digital transition FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German industry leaders want a shift toward digital services to be a priority as the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) appear set to enter coalition talks with Angela Merkel s conservatives and the Greens. The FDP, which returned from the German political wilderness with 10.7 percent of the vote in Sunday s election, promise to cut taxes and raise investment in infrastructure, partly funded by privatizations. Investing in high-speed telecoms networks and automation would boost economic activity and global competitiveness and has long been a key demand of Germany s export-led manufacturers   although some workers fear it risks job losses.  Investments in education and digital infrastructure are urgently needed,  Werner Baumann, chief executive of drugmaker Bayer (BAYGn.DE), said in an emailed statement. Joe Kaeser, chief executive of industrial group Siemens (SIEGn.DE) agreed, but warned of marginalizing workers and pushing them into the arms of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the first far-right party to enter the German parliament in more than half a century.  We are an industrial nation and must shape the fourth industrial revolution and design it in a socially inclusive way - so that as many people profit from its as possible,  he said. Economists see such investments as a way to combat the effects of an ageing population and to boost stalling productivity gains, factors that are casting a shadow over growth prospects in the medium term in Europe s largest economy.  Domestically, a focus on digitalisation is one opportunity to counteract these structural headwinds, and re-accelerate productivity growth,  Morgan Stanley economist Elga Bartsch wrote in a note. German business confidence deteriorated unexpectedly in the weeks before Sunday s federal election, suggesting that a consumption-led upswing could lose momentum in coming months. Thilo Brodtmann, executive director of powerful engineering lobby VDMA, said on Monday:  We need a clear signal for a digital breakthrough, for education and research, innovation-friendly tax policies and above all a priority for flexibility and good ideas.  The VDMA represents large manufacturers such as engineering group Siemens, robot maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) or machine-tool maker DMG Mori (GILG.DE) as well as a host of smaller firms banking on digitization to boost productivity. And a host of communications firms including Vodafone (VOD.L), Liberty Global (LBTYA.O) and United Internet (UTDI.DE) stand ready to take advantage of funds that may be made available to expand rural broadband, for example through the further privatization of incumbent Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE).  But UBS economist Felix Huefner said he doubted that any radical stimulus measures would be taken soon, given that the German economy is expected to grow at its strongest pace in six years this year.  Even if digitalization may be a key priority for Merkel, we don t expect deep reforms... given the lack of pressure in a very benign economic environment,  he wrote in a note.    ",0
"Sweden: Migrant Cries ’Racism’ When Woman in Hijab Asked to Show Train Ticket Attacks Passengers with Knife An Iraqi man travelling from Stockholm to Hallsberg by train launched a brutal attack on passengers after a Muslim woman was asked to show her ticket, accusing them all of racism. [Karim Alaa Hussain, 25, became infuriated when the unnamed woman, who was wearing a veil, was asked to show her rail ticket by a female conductor.  The Muslim woman complained she had already been asked to show her ticket once before, although eyewitnesses say the conductor was “polite and correct”. Hussain took a different view, according to a report by Fria Tider, corroborated by court documents seen by Breitbart London. Hussain sprang to his feet and demanded to know why the conductor had asked to see the woman’s ticket, refusing to accept her explanation that she was “only doing her job” and he became “extremely intimidating”. Other passengers intervened to try and calm him down, but this only increased his anger. He accused them of racism, threatening one of the men in particular and striking him in the face. Alarmed, Hussain’s victim wrestled him to the floor  —   but the Iraqi managed to break free and produced a long kitchen knife, stabbing the man four times in the side and back and inflicting critical internal wounds. Witnesses describe how Hussain then strode around the train cabin “as if he had won the national championship” brandishing his bloody knife at the terrified passengers and demanding a father and his daughter tell him if they were “also racists”. Hussain then began lecturing his captive audience on equality, instructing them that everyone was of “equal value” and demanding they show respect while his victim lay bleeding. When the train stopped Hussain fled and hid in a nearby garden, but was apprehended by the police. He told officers he had acted in   and was “proud” of what he had done, but the judge did not accept this, handing him a nominal      sentence. Hussain has an extremely long criminal record, and should have been serving a      sentence for a variety of offences at the time of his attack  —   but was released early. He will not be deported from Sweden after his current sentence is completed, having been awarded EU citizenship in 2008 despite having already wracked up several convictions.",0
"Gays Against Sharia March Branded ’Islamophobic’, Will Be Picketed by LGBT Activists An event organised by Gays Against Sharia to mark the anniversary of the Orlando shooting has been branded “divisive” and “Islamophobic” by LGBT activists planning a  . [The organisers of the Unite Against Hate march, set to take place in Manchester on Sunday, say they organised the event to “honour the victims of hate” including the 49 people who lost their lives at Pulse, a gay club in Orlando, Florida, at the hands of an Islamic terrorist on June 12, 2016.  Planned speakers include author Shazia Hobbs, a Glaswegian who was forced into an arranged marriage at 18 with a man who beat her, believing it was his right under Sharia law Mohammed Fiaz, a Christian convert from Islam and founder and former leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson. But LGBT activists have reacted with fury, insisting the event is nothing more than the cynical hijacking of gay rights by the “far right” as a cover for Islamophobia. Two groups, Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants, and Action for Trans Health, are arranging a   against the march. “We’re protesting because the   want to use Orlando and the recent killings in the UK to demonise all Muslims,” one of the organisers of the   Anna, told Pink News. “We are clear that it is genocidal to consider millions of people responsible for the actions of a few violent men. “As queers, we know what it’s like for   to hate us  —   so we won’t be divided like this. ” One of the organisers of the Unite Against Hate march is Tommy English, a fellow traveller of Tommy Robinson’s and former leader of the English Defence League’s LGBT group who now runs Gays Against Sharia. Opponents have seized upon his presence to claim the march is nothing but a front for   Islamophobes. Pink News quotes Sam Bjorn as saying: “As LGBT+ people we won’t stand idly by as far right bigots like the EDL attempt to use our rights as a weapon against people from the Muslim community. “When groups like the EDL are preying on tragedy like the recent attack in Manchester to promote hate and division, it’s more important than ever to come together and say that we do not tolerate their Islamophobia and racism. “We encourage everyone, gay or straight, to join us on 11 June to show that the LGBT+ community and the people of Manchester won’t let the hate of   bigots divide us. ” Pink News has joined in the condemnation, branding the event as a “fake” and accusing the organisers of “hijacking the first anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting with an   march,” which it described as a “disturbing tactic”. Veteran gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has also entered the fray, tweeting his opposition to the march.

"China Sees New Ambiguity With Donald Trump’s Taiwan Call - The New York Times BEIJING  —   China’s leaders have been markedly reticent about what kind of leader they think Donald J. Trump will be. A pragmatic dealmaker, as his business background might indicate? Or a provocateur who tests the ways of statecraft? By talking on Friday with Taiwan’s president, Tsai   Mr. Trump answered that question in stark terms, Chinese analysts said Saturday. Breaking decades of American diplomatic practice, he caught the Chinese government off guard by lunging into the most sensitive of its   core interests, the “One China” policy agreed to by President Richard M. Nixon more than four decades ago. “This is a   call for Beijing  —   we should buckle up for a pretty rocky six months or year in the  . S. relationship,” Wang Dong, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University, said Saturday. “There was a sort of delusion based on overly optimistic ideas about Trump. That should stop. ” Chinese leaders covet stability in their relationship with Washington, and perhaps for that reason, they have allowed fairly rosy assessments of Mr. Trump to appear in the   news media. Many of those accounts have depicted the   as a practical operator devoid of ideology, the kind of person China might find common ground with despite his threats of a trade war. In the hope of maintaining a relatively smooth relationship as Mr. Trump begins his administration, Beijing will probably take a    attitude despite his phone call with Ms. Tsai, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. Indeed, China’s first official reaction, from Foreign Minister Wang Yi, was fairly benign  —   though it was firm in reiterating the One China policy, under which the United States formally recognized Beijing as China’s sole government in 1978 and broke ties with Taiwan a year later. No American president or   had spoken to a Taiwanese president since then. Mr. Wang blamed Ms. Tsai’s government for arranging the call. “It won’t stand a chance to change the One China policy agreed upon by the international community,” he said. A   statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday, noting that the ministry had filed a formal complaint with the United States government, was similar in tone. It urged “relevant parties in the U. S. ” to “deal with the Taiwan issue in a prudent, proper manner. ” China’s leaders disdain Ms. Tsai, of Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party, who was elected president this year after pledging to wean the island off its economic dependence on China, a policy that won enthusiastic support from younger Taiwanese. China favored her original opponent, Hung   of the Kuomintang, which has sought closer ties with mainland China. (Ms. Hung later dropped out of the race.) Before the election, President Xi Jinping of China met with Ms. Tsai’s predecessor, Ma   also of the Kuomintang, in the first encounter between the leaders of the two governments, a rapprochement that Beijing had long sought. Mr. Trump broke a Chinese taboo merely by using Ms. Tsai’s title. The Chinese state news media refer to the Taiwanese president as the “leader of the Taiwan region,” to indicate that Beijing regards Taiwan not as a sovereign nation but as Chinese territory to eventually be brought under its control. A basic tenet of the Chinese government is that Taiwan, where Chiang  ’s forces fled in 1949 after losing China’s civil war, will be brought back into the fold. According to Mr. Xi, Taiwan is destined to become an integral part of his   China Dream, a vision of an economically successful Communist China astride the world. Mr. Trump’s phone call also violated a longstanding principle of American policy: that the president does not speak to the head of Taiwan’s government, despite selling arms to it. “Interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter after the stunned reaction to his conversation with Ms. Tsai. Though Beijing vehemently protests the arms sales, it also warily acknowledges them as part of   practice. Since the   Washington has signaled to Taiwan that it will not support any military effort to gain independence from China. The Obama administration’s last arms sale to Taiwan, in 2015, was relatively modest  —   consisting of antitank missiles, two frigates and surveillance gear, worth $1. 8 billion in total  —   but it still provoked a bitter denunciation from Beijing. Douglas H. Paal, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which represents American interests there, said it would not be surprising if the United States sold arms to Taiwan early in the Trump administration. Beijing’s reaction would depend on the price tag, the kinds of weapons sold and how the administration informed China of the sale, Mr. Paal said. While it broke diplomatic precedent, Mr. Trump’s conversation with Ms. Tsai could be seen in some ways as following a pattern of Republican presidents’ reaching out to Taiwan, although others did not do so before taking office. George W. Bush, for example, was vocal in his support of Taiwan early in his presidency, saying in a television interview that the United States would do “whatever it took” to defend it. His aides said afterward that the comment did not reflect a change in the One China policy. By the end of his second term, Mr. Bush had helped to strengthen trade ties between Beijing and Washington through the approval of China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Though Mr. Trump has received generally favorable coverage in the state news media, some Chinese analysts have expressed irritation with him, and some have suggested that his administration will offer China opportunities to show strength. Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University and a foreign policy hawk, said the overall tenor of the   States relationship in the coming years would depend a great deal on the personal chemistry between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. He said China, with its growing military and the   economy in the world, could largely afford to act as it liked. “China is increasingly resilient to the United States,” he said. Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, took a contrarian view of Mr. Trump’s call with Ms. Tsai: He said it was not a problem because Mr. Trump had yet to take office. “He is a private citizen,” he said. But if such contacts continue after Inauguration Day, Mr. Shen said, China should end diplomatic relations with the United States. “I would close our embassy in Washington and withdraw our diplomats,” he said. “I would be perfectly happy to end the relationship. I don’t know how you are then going to expect China to cooperate on Iran and North Korea and climate change. You are going to ask Taiwan for that?”",0
"Learning to Speak for the Dead - The New York Times The dead man waited on a gurney. His corpulent frame, after days of decomposing, had turned the mottled green of a ripe watermelon. He had been found alone in bed in his Manhattan apartment, surrounded by an avalanche of discarded bottles and trash. Now Dr. Jacqueline Nunez was by his side. As a medical examiner training in New York City, she had the job of finding out what had happened to him. It would not be quick or easy, not like television crime shows in which deaths are neatly wrapped up in under an hour. The job requires examiners to break apart bodies: hard physical work.   too. Dr. Nunez would be on her feet for hours, splattered by blood and other body fluids, at times breathing an unimaginable stench. She could spend weeks, or even months, piecing together clues that might never add up. Standing on top of a metal stool, Dr. Nunez cut into the torso. A thick greenish fluid oozed out. She grabbed an   ladle to scoop out more of it. Then she stuck both hands into the body to feel around for the liver. She came up empty, her gloves dripping. “Oh, what a mess,” she said. “I’m not sure what’s going on. This is the worst I’ve ever seen. ” It got messier. Dr. Nunez cracked open the chest with clippers to remove the heart and the lungs. She cut out the intestines. Then, as a whirring electric saw was used to open the skull, Dr. Nunez reached in to lift out the brain. When she was finished, she cleaned up. Then she started on her next patient. DR. NUNEZ is part of a New York City fellowship program that has become one of the country’s most renowned training grounds for medical examiners. The Forensic Pathology Fellows Program has helped resurrect a   agency, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, which as recently as the 1980s was widely accused of incompetent management and bias toward the police. The estimated 500 forensic pathologists working nationwide are roughly half the number needed, according to the National Association of Medical Examiners. “Everyone who passes the medical examiner’s boards is sought after,” said Dr. David Fowler, the association’s president, who attributed the shortage to limited training opportunities and relatively low compensation compared with the pay that pathologists receive at hospitals or in private practice. Since 1990, the New York fellowship program has trained 100 medical examiners. The program has bolstered the agency’s status as a national model for medical examiner’s offices and has been the source of a new generation of forensic experts, producing the current or former chief medical examiners in more than 20 jurisdictions, including Washington, San Francisco, Honolulu and the States of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont. Since the program is based in New York, the city is somewhat insulated from the shortage elsewhere in the country. Dr. Nunez, 34, is one of five doctors who have spent the past year preparing to become medical examiners. A cheerful woman who favors large gold hoop earrings, she is often mistaken for a schoolteacher. She grew up in Amityville, on Long Island, the older of two children of a landscape worker and a homemaker, and she went to medical school in the Dominican Republic. Instead of a black doctor’s bag, she carries a   Craftsman toolbox packed with knives, scalpels, forceps and scissors. She does not mind working on bodies, not even one that is decomposing, known as a “decomp,” which is often the least favorite case for medical examiners. “A lot of people  —   especially other physicians and other pathologists  —   used to tell me, ‘I would have loved to have done forensics, but I can’t deal with the decomp,’” she said. “I actually have no problem doing them, and one of the reasons is because I feel like I’m the last person that is going to be providing some kind of care, bridging their death and their life. I’m the last person. ” NEW YORK CITY’S Office of Chief Medical Examiner is based in a squat,   building, at 520 First Avenue, with letters missing from its name. Inside, a Latin inscription behind the reception desk translates to: “This is the place where the dead help the living. ” The medical examiners are the conduit for the two, providing answers, consoling grieving relatives and, if needed, informing police detectives. They fill a crucial but often overlooked role in a city where 5, 000 autopsies a year are performed for deaths that are deemed sudden or suspicious or are a result of crimes, accidents or suicides. It was medical examiners who sifted through the remains of more than 2, 700 victims after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. When there were no intact bodies, the pathologists had to improvise. They measured fingers to help identify people, using metal ring sizers that were donated in Tiffany’s little blue bags. That was also the year when Flight 587 crashed in Queens with 260 people aboard, and the year when envelopes laced with anthrax became a new terror threat. “When things get bad here, they get very bad,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson, who was appointed the city’s chief medical examiner in 2014. The agency’s staff of 600 includes 24 senior medical examiners, 20 of whom graduated from the fellowship program. The agency runs offices in every borough, three mortuaries and the country’s largest public DNA lab, along with other labs for toxicology, molecular genetics and histology, the microscopic examination of tissue. The agency’s $75 million annual budget is the equivalent of $8. 82 per city resident for the laboratories, investigations and other activities, far more than the national average of $3. 36 per resident, according to the National Association of Medical Examiners. Dr. Sampson, herself a 1998 fellow, says she looks for future medical examiners who can communicate and work well with others. The fellows, who have already graduated from medical school and completed a residency program in pathology, are selected after a   unpaid tryout. They receive a salary of $131, 566 for the academic year, which runs from July 1 through June. At the end, the fellows sit for a nationally administered board exam nearly everyone passes. Some will be offered permanent positions as senior medical examiners with annual salaries starting at $159, 741, or invited to continue as fellows for a second year to specialize in the pathology of the brain and the heart. In contrast, general pathologists at hospitals and in private practice typically earn $200, 000 or more. In total, there have been 58 women and 42 men in the program. About   are black, Hispanic or Asian. Many have foreign backgrounds. This year’s fellows include doctors who grew up in Croatia, Russia and Mexico. For some it is a calling. Dr. Stephen Melito, 32, went to medical school just so he could become a medical examiner. As a teenager in Farmingdale, on Long Island, he used to volunteer as an underage buyer of cigarettes in undercover police operations. For a high school class, he researched how to tell the time of death at a crime scene. Dr. Kanayo Tatsumi relocated to New York from Vermont less than a year after she was married. Her husband, a surgical resident, stayed behind to finish his training. Dr. Tatsumi, 33, was still in college when she interned at an Illinois coroner’s office. The first autopsy she observed was of a young woman killed in a car accident. She could not stop thinking about her. Had she been wearing a seatbelt? Had her airbag deployed? “It could have been me it could have been any of my friends,” Dr. Tatsumi recalled. “I started realizing that we could do a lot to prevent injuries, even though we’re getting that data, if you will, from death. ” THE MEDICAL EXAMINERS in training have desks side by side in Room 335  —   known as the fellows’ room  —   where a bulletin board is crammed with photos of fellows in hazmat suits, at parties and holding babies. They alternate between “A” days for autopsies and “P” days for paperwork, while squeezing in lectures on topics like firearm injuries,   trauma and pediatric deaths. They go to crime scenes, rotate through the labs and learn to handle infectious diseases like Ebola and respond to terror threats. The A days begin with an 8 a. m. triage meeting. Dr. Nunez stood behind a lectern, presenting case histories to senior medical examiners, forensic anthropologists, police detectives and medical students. There were 11 cases that day, not unusual in number or scope: An older man died after falling at home a younger man with a cocaine habit was found dead by his brother. Afterward, Dr. Nunez headed down to the mortuary. She checked the body bags in the hallway. “This is one of mine,” she called out to a technician. “This is another one. I’ve got one more. ” Her next stop was the autopsy room, which has eight stations, each equipped with a metal table and a scale. By 9:30 a. m. Dr. Nunez was at one of the stations, engrossed in her first case. A thin black man lay on the table. She removed his pancreas. It had dark spots where blood had pooled, a possible sign that he had spent a lot of time out in the cold before he died. Just before 11 a. m. she was ready for her next case. Dr. Nunez does not take breaks or stop for lunch. “Once I get going, I just keep up the pace,” she said. “You build endurance, you pick up stamina and you get used to it. That’s what this year is for. ” Her scrubs were stained with blood and fluids. “I’m not squeamish about it at all anymore,” she said. At 3 p. m. Dr. Nunez was still working on her third autopsy when the other medical examiners reconvened to review their findings. She did not have much to report yet. “It happens,” she said. “I’d rather we look at everything and not rush through anything. ’’ Afterward, Dr. Nunez retreated to the fellows’ room to draft a report for each autopsy. She would order lab tests, interview relatives and consider other evidence before closing each case. Dr. Sampson reads every report. The fellowship program is the legacy of Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, the city’s chief medical examiner from 1989 to 2013, who was known to focus not only on technical skills but also on scientific integrity, common sense and compassion. “I still quote Dr. Hirsch two or three times a day,” said Dr. Susan Ely, a 1997 fellow who is now the program’s director. “His presence is still very much felt here. ” Dr. Hirsch, a former chief medical examiner for Suffolk County, was appointed in 1989 by Mayor Edward I. Koch, to lead an agency battered by conflict and mistrust. The mayor had fired the previous chief medical examiner, Dr. Elliot M. Gross, citing poor leadership and management. In 1985, Dr. Gross was accused by defense lawyers and forensic specialists of producing misleading or inaccurate autopsy findings in cases of people who died in police custody. A mayoral commission cleared him of wrongdoing but faulted a longstanding agency practice in which deaths in police custody were routinely left as undetermined. Though the medical examiner’s office is now considered professionally run and independent, it has not entirely escaped controversy. The agency has been challenged for using a highly sensitive technique to analyze trace samples of DNA  —   known as low copy number DNA testing  —   that has been criticized as unreliable. In February, a former toxicology lab director sued the city, claiming that she was forced out in part for raising questions about its use of the technique. EACH FELLOW is expected to complete about 250 autopsies, a goal based on national standards for training medical examiners. The sheer diversity of cases in a big city ensures that they see just about every kind of injury imaginable. Dr. Judy Melinek, who chronicled her fellowship experience in a 2014 memoir, “Working Stiff,” recalled that she was told to go to New York by a former fellow who noted, “All kinds of great ways to die there, and the teaching is brilliant. ” Dr. Rafael Garcia, 36, had barely started the fellowship program in July when he was assigned not only his first homicide but a double homicide. He spent seven hours working on just one of the victims, a man who had been stabbed 20 times. As it happened, he had attended a lecture on stab wounds the day before. Almost a year later, Dr. Garcia has completed 250 autopsies, of which about   have not been resolved. “It’s funny to see a TV show and how they do everything in the same day,” he said. “That’s not reality. ” Dr. Garcia, a father of two who grew up in Mexico and trained to be an ophthalmologist, said he had no regrets about switching to forensic pathology. “Money is important,” he said, “but I’d rather feel happy with what I’m doing than just being frustrated by an entire life doing something that I don’t enjoy as much. ” The fellows keep track of their autopsies in Excel spreadsheets that list the names of the dead, brief histories and findings. The most common deaths are accidental or natural the least common are undetermined in cause or manner of death, or both. At one point in February, when Dr. Nunez surpassed 150 autopsies, her fiancé, an accountant, figured that she needed to complete about 25 autopsies per month in the time left. In May, she surpassed 215 autopsies. By Tuesday, she was at 242. Though she tries to stay positive, Dr. Nunez said the cases can take an emotional toll. She tries to decompress by going out to dinner with her fiancé and spending time with their extended families. Still, she loses sleep. “I feel like I want to give them more than I can, and I know I can’t,” she said of the victims’ families. “Something the senior medical examiners tell me all the time is, ‘You’ve done a full, competent exam.’ There are limitations. You have to learn to become comfortable with limitations. ” The other fellows have ways of coping, too. Dr. Melito said he did not check the news at home in New Jersey, where he lives with his wife, Mary, a teacher, and their two young children. On hard days, he gets extra hugs. Dr. Tatsumi said she found herself crying a lot. In an autopsy, she will discover that someone did not die right away and probably felt pain or fear in the final moments. “That just destroys me,” she said. “I’m not very good at hiding things, and so I wear it on my sleeve I wear it on my face. ” The five medical examiners in training have been invited to stay on. All have accepted except for Dr. Melito, who is taking a job closer to home. In Dr. Sampson’s office, there are framed photos of every class of fellows on graduation day  —   the counterpart of the informal collage upstairs in the fellows’ room. Nearly all of these smiling group shots are arranged in neat columns running down one wall. “This side is all Dr. Hirsch,” Dr. Sampson said. She pointed across the room, where there are just two photos of the last two fellows’ classes. “And that’s my wall,” she said. “Hopefully, it will be long someday. ” A photo of Dr. Nunez’s class will soon be added. Even in medical school, Dr. Nunez said, she was interested in the cause of a disease more than the treatment. A doctor would be poring over a patient’s lab work while “all I’m thinking is, I really wish I could take a piece of this woman’s lung to see what’s happening. ” Dr. Nunez said that she still wanted those answers, but that now her desire was to serve the families left behind. “I think that’s definitely what drew me the most,” she said. “It’s being able to be useful, and bring closure to families, and give them answers that they otherwise weren’t going to have. ”",0
"Ecuador Votes as Latin America’s Left Sags, a Generation of Icons Gone - The New York Times QUITO, Ecuador  —   For most of Luis García’s adult life, a single name dominated the politics of this tiny Andean country: Rafael Correa, the leftist leader of Ecuador’s   citizens’ revolution. But when Mr. García went to the polls Sunday, Mr. Correa was not on the ballot. Unsatisfied with the options that remained, Mr. García, a    musician who first voted for Mr. Correa in 2006, chose to simply scribble over his ballot, rendering it invalid. “I don’t feel represented now,” he said. That feeling of malaise among the left has been spreading throughout Latin America as, one by one, a generation of iconic leaders has departed the stage, brought down by death, elections, impeachment or, in Mr. Correa’s case, term limits. They were known by many names, including the New Left, and ruled the length of the continent with big promises and bigger personalities. Picking up the mantle of the revolutions for which the region became famous in the 1960s and 1970s, these leaders expanded education, increased subsidies for the poor and built roads, highways and hospitals. But they often ran roughshod over those who tried to check their power, from judges to international lenders. And now, nearly all are gone. Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s fiery leader, died of cancer in 2013, leaving behind a far less popular successor, Nicolás Maduro. The country spiraled into economic collapse as oil prices fell and the country elected the opposition to its National Assembly in 2015. Mr. Maduro dug in, tightening his grip with increasing repression. In Argentina in 2015, voters elected a   businessman to replace a populist, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, whose programs were popular with the poor and working class. The following year in Brazil, the leftist Dilma Rousseff was ousted through  impeachment. Her Workers’ Party now faces numerous corruption allegations, while Ms. Kirchner is defending herself against an indictment on financial charges. Then, November brought the death of the   of the region’s left: Fidel Castro of Cuba. “These are not isolated events it is a great reversal,” said Gabriela Rivadeneira, the president of Ecuador’s National Assembly, controlled by Mr. Correa’s Alianza País party, which for years   his reforms with few questions asked. “We are now the place that the region is looking at for what comes next. ” Mr. Correa was a    and often contradictory figure, an   economist who regularly flipped between the mold of a fiery populist and the pragmatism of a studied technocrat. By most accounts, poverty and inequality decreased in Ecuador as Mr. Correa funneled oil revenue into everything from raising the salaries of teachers to rebuilding the country’s highways and expanding clinics into the Amazon region. It helped that the price of oil was more than $100 per barrel for some of his tenure. Wealth flowed into the capital, Quito, whose streets bustle with new cars and S. U. V.s as workers dig a vast new metro system below. Mr. Correa also pulled his tiny country onto the international stage, echoing Mr. Castro from an earlier time by railing against capitalism and globalization. In 2012, he granted Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, protection at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, a thumb in the eye of the United States. Mr. Assange remains there today. But whether Ecuador’s leftist agenda will continue when Mr. Correa leaves office is unclear. There is the question of oil revenue, for one. As in Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil, the social programs in Ecuador that lifted millions out of poverty were underwritten by a commodities boom that sputtered out years ago. Government revenue, around $25 billion a year when oil prices spiked, has now shrunk to less than half that, $11 billion, mainly because of the declining price of oil. That has left the country heavily indebted to China. Ecuador’s economy ground to a halt last year after growing, on average, 4 percent or more from 2006 to 2014. “The model has reached its end because the money has run out,” said César Robalino, a conservative banker at the Pichincha College of Economists in Quito. Mr. Robalino said Ecuador’s next president, regardless of political affiliation, would need to take a tougher line on spending, reduce the number of government workers and cut subsidies like the ones used to reduce gas prices for all Ecuadoreans. That is the stance championed by the conservative opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso, a wealthy banker from Mr. Correa’s hometown, Guayaquil, who finished second in the last election against him in 2013. Mr. Lasso is promising to roll back public spending while eliminating more than a dozen taxes, which would mean the loss of billions of dollars from state coffers. “What a government should do is facilitate entrepreneurship,” Mr. Lasso said in a TV interview during the campaign, adding that he thought Mr. Correa generated too much employment through   jobs. Lenin Moreno, the leading   candidate, has promised to do more with less, borrowing when necessary. In a response to written questions, Mr. Moreno said that despite the collapse of oil prices, Mr. Correa had avoided cutting social programs and gas subsidies used by the poor. Mr. Moreno said he would continue that policy if the left won. With about 80 percent of ballots counted on Sunday night, Mr. Moreno, 63, a former deputy of Mr. Correa, was leading with 38. 8 percent, just more than a point short of the threshold needed to avoid a second round in April. Analysts said that if the numbers held, they would create an opening for Mr. Lasso, who was in second place, to unite his and the remaining opposition votes and potentially capture the presidency. If Mr. Moreno wins, he will face the challenge of setting himself apart from his predecessor and his legacy. Mr. Correa has said he will move to Belgium after his term ends, but some argue that if the left remains in power, Mr. Correa will try to influence politics from behind the scenes. “‘I command, I direct,’ is how he thinks,” said Jorge León, a political scientist at the Central University of Ecuador. Mr. León pointed to an authoritarian streak in Mr. Correa that also became a hallmark of leftists in several other South American countries. After changing the Constitution  —   a move that allowed him to be   twice  —   the president proposed allowing himself to run for a fourth time. (He backtracked when it became clear that popular opinion was against him.) Mr. Correa also tried to make life difficult for his critics during his time in office. He sued journalists, toughened defamation laws and even took over TV channels whose owners criticized him. More recently, he tried to close an environmental group that was stirring up opposition to a planned copper mine in the Amazon. It will be up to Mr. Correa’s successor to decide whether to build on his legacy or reverse it. But those who have tried to forge a different path in the region have faced troubles. President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, despite his vow to revive the country’s economy with   policies, has had trouble attracting investment to his country, noted Franklin Ramírez, a professor at the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Quito. Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, has been dogged by corruption allegations similar to those that brought down leftists. “It’s a little early to speak of the end of a cycle here” for the left, Mr. Ramírez said. “The hegemony of the left has ended,” he said, but added that it was not clear what would replace it.",0
"Gavel Battle: Boehner resignation sparks House leadership scramble House Speaker John Boehner’s stunning announcement that he will resign his post and seat in Congress sparked chaos on Capitol Hill Friday, with lawmakers immediately jockeying for position ahead of the upcoming reshuffle.

“This is going to be a barn burner of a leadership election,” one source said.

The 13-term Ohio Republican shocked his GOP caucus early Friday morning when he informed them in a closed-door session that he intends to step down at the end of October. One lawmaker told Fox News he was ""stunned,"" and that there was ""some anger"" in the room ""against the people who caused this to happen.""

But the drama didn't stop the almost-immediate scramble for his gavel.

Some lawmakers swiftly hit the phones, making intense calls as they jockeyed for position ahead of what could potentially be an overhaul of the entire leadership team.

The immediate favorite to inherit the gavel is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., a Boehner ally. Fox News is told he's actively seeking the post.

Asked about a potential successor, Boehner said that's ""up to the members"" but then gave McCarthy a near-endorsement: ""I think Kevin McCarthy would be an excellent speaker.""

But it is far from a done deal, with Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas; Rep. Pete Roskam, R-Ill.; and  Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., thought to be potential candidates who could throw their hats into the ring.

Fox News learned late Friday that Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La, are both looking at running for the leadership position.

The leadership battle also begins as Congress still struggles over a budget measure and efforts by conservatives to defund Planned Parenthood as part of it. Even if that issue is resolved in the near-term, the next speaker will confront those same partisan divisions.

Not everyone wants that responsibility. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the party's vice presidential nominee in 2012, has already ruled himself out of the race, calling the job “a great job for empty nesters.”

For his part, Roskam attempted to become whip after then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his primary race last June, and was replaced in leadership by McCarthy – then the majority whip. However, Roskam was beaten by Scalise.

Fox News understands Roskam is one of the lawmakers jockeying for position. When asked for comment, Roskam warned against merely “reshuffling the deck.”

""I'm for somebody who can bridge the divide in our Conference. If we don't have a plan to get us out of this dysfunction, reshuffling the deck won't make anything better. I'm going to work hard to make sure we get the leadership we need, not just settle on the fastest, easiest choice,"" Roskam said.

An aide to Hensarling told Fox News that he was considering his options and would expect to have a decision next week.

Should McCarthy succeed Boehner, there would be an opening for House majority leader, as well as potentially further down the roster in positions such as majority whip.

Boehner’s backing may help McCarthy’s chances with the establishment, but may hurt him elsewhere.

“[Boehner’s backing] will help him with the establishment but not with the conservative House Freedom Caucus. He may face a challenge [from conservatives] but even the House Freedom Caucus admit they aren’t organized, and so they may not even put up a candidate,” GOP strategist Ron Bonjean told FoxNews.com. “Speed is the key. Waiting can hurt your chances. Members who can get members behind them can build momentum, and a snowball effect allows them to wrap things up. That’s what McCarthy is going for – there’s already a sense of inevitability that he’s getting the job.”

If conservatives do put forward a candidate of their own, Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio and Rep. Ted Yoho R-Fla., are among the names that could be put forward.

Democrats, too, will almost certainly run Boehner’s predecessor -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- for the post.

At a press conference Friday afternoon with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Obama also voiced his own general hopes for the next speaker:

“My hope is there’s a recognition on the part of the next speaker, something I think John understood … that we can have significant differences on issues but that doesn’t mean you shut down the government,” Obama said.

Boehner's resignation could make next week's budget battle easier to resolve in the short-term. Conservatives want to use the budget measure to defund Planned Parenthood, and Boehner previously had to worry about an internal party revolt if he tried to strike a deal with Democrats to pass a ""clean"" budget bill.

However, it also could work the other way. A lame-duck Boehner could open a situation where aspiring GOP leaders are put on the spot and under even more pressure from the conservative wing.

Once Boehner resigns, the total number of members in the House will be 434. An absolute majority of the House is required to elect a new speaker, not a simple majority -- meaning the magic number of votes that a candidate must get is 218.

Once Boehner resigns, the House will be unable to do anything until it elects a new speaker.

Boehner’s resignation is rare, but not unprecedented. The last speaker to resign in the middle of a Congress was Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas who resigned in 1989 amid an ethics scandal.

"Suppressing free press is 'how dictators get started': Senator McCain MUNICH (Reuters) - Senator John McCain, defending the media against the latest attack by President Donald Trump, warned that suppressing the free press was “how dictators get started”. The Arizona Republican, a frequent critic of Trump, was responding to a tweet in which Trump accused the media of being “the enemy of the American people”. The international order established after World War Two was built in part on a free press, McCain said in an excerpt of an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that was released in advance of the full Sunday morning broadcast. “I hate the press. I hate you especially,” he told interviewer Chuck Todd from an international security conference in Munich. “But the fact is we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It’s vital.” “If you want to preserve - I’m very serious now - if you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press. And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That’s how dictators get started,” he continued. “They get started by suppressing free press. In other words, a consolidation of power. When you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I’m not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I’m just saying we need to learn the lessons of history,” McCain said. U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, told the conference on Sunday she was also concerned about Trump’s comments. “The real danger is the president’s criticism of the media,” Shaheen told the conference. “A free press ... is very important to maintaining democracy, and efforts on the part of a president to undermine and manipulate the press are very dangerous.” The comments from U.S. lawmakers followed Trump’s tweet and came days after the president held a raucous news conference at which he repeatedly criticized news reports about disorder in the White House and leaks of his telephone conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia. German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized the importance of a free press at the conference on Saturday, saying, “I have high respect for journalists. We’ve always had good results, at least in Germany, by relying on mutual respect.” ",0
"Ted Cruz Busts Elon Musk for Flying Private Jet While Lecturing Trump on Global Warming - Breitbart Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) ripped into Tesla CEO Elon Musk Thursday night for his use of a private jet after the tech billionaire tweeted his disapproval of President Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord. [Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, took to Twitter to announce that he would be departing from all future presidential councils in protest of President Trump’s decision to pull the U. S. out of the Paris Climate Accord. He assured his followers that global warming is real and that leaving the Paris accords is “not good” for America or the world.  Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.  —   Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017,  Hours later, Cruz mocked Musk’s outrage, pointing out that he regularly travels around the country in his own private jet. If the billionaire CEO was so dedicated to reducing the world’s carbon output, Cruz snarked, he would choose to fly commercial planes rather than private ones. In support of Paris, CA billionaires pledge to never again fly private, will only fly commercial.   —  will quit symbolic councils instead. https:  .   —   Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) June 2, 2017,  Musk has come under fire previously for his liberal use of his private jet, which he upgraded last year from a Dassault Falcon 900 B to a Gulfstream G650 ER. It was reported in 2010 that Musk took private jets to Washington on at least 12 occasions over the course of two years to lobby the Department of Energy for a loan of $465 million, which Musk’s company Tesla was eventually granted. Around the same time, Tesla also struck deals with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority that made the company exempt from up to $320 million in California State sales and U. S. taxes. Musk has been a vocal supporter of carbon taxes, saying, “All we are doing [with a carbon tax] is trying to match the inherent subsidy for fossil fuels  …     on the sustainable energy side. Fossil fuels are already getting a massive subsidy if you believe in global warming. If you don’t then [the subsidy] seems really unfair.

"Once credited with Trump's success, Bannon quickly fell from grace WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump fired White House chief strategist and former campaign manager Steve Bannon on Friday, it was almost like bidding goodbye to a part of himself. Trump’s most polarizing stances on matters such as immigration and national security closely tracked Bannon’s “America First” anti-globalist worldview. Despite their close alignment, Trump was always reluctant to credit Bannon with the stunning electoral victory of November 2016, often noting Bannon, 63, came late to the campaign, joining only after Trump had secured the Republican nomination. He rewarded Bannon, nonetheless, giving him a top job in the administration. But as the White House grew increasingly chaotic in the early months of Trump’s presidency, Bannon clashed with more mainstream advisers, including, most crucially, the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump.  Trump was reportedly unhappy with the attention that Bannon got early on as the architect of Trump’s campaign, and with Bannon’s tendency to promote himself, as he operated an almost independent power center within the West Wing.  Ultimately, Bannon wore out his welcome. Trump fired him at the urging of his new chief of staff, John Kelly, who has been working to reorganize the White House and limit access to Trump. The dismissal could have political repercussions. Bannon was viewed as the administration’s conduit to Trump’s rabid political base. Bannon’s departure may antagonize some of Trump’s most passionate supporters, who fear that without Bannon, Trump will move closer to the Republican political establishment. “We are extremely disappointed,” Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, a conservative advocacy group, said in a statement. On specific policies, Bannon was credited with helping craft the administration’s “travel ban,” which restricted emigration to the United States from some mostly Muslim countries, as well as Trump’s opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact and the Paris global climate accord. Bannon has been seen as wary of U.S. intervention abroad, arguing against sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. In recent months, Bannon has battled for influence inside the White House with Trump’s national security adviser, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, a tension that was destabilizing Trump’s team of top advisers, senior officials have told Reuters. Trump himself has suggested Bannon’s influence was overstated. While Bannon was viewed as perhaps responsible for Trump’s initial response to the violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, when he blamed both sides for the confrontation, Trump said this week that he never spoke to Bannon about the matter. Bannon may return to the provocateur role he played at the right-wing Breitbart News website, where he spearheaded its shift into a forum for the “alt-right,” a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. Under Bannon’s leadership, the Breitbart site presented a number of conspiracy theories about former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as Republicans deemed to be lacking in conservative bona fides. Whether he returns to Breitbart and uses it to challenge the so-called “cucks” and “globalists” he disdains - and perhaps Trump himself - will be closely watched in coming weeks. Bannon is a former U.S. Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker and Hollywood producer. Almost immediately after Bannon’s departure became public, Breitbart published a piece calling him “the conservative spine” of the administration and questioning whether Trump would now move in a more moderate direction. Another Breitbart editor, Raheem Kassam, posted a picture of Bannon on Twitter with the caption Bannon 2020, seemingly suggesting that Bannon, not Trump, should be president. ",0
"Trump judicial nominee withdraws from consideration WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lawyer nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as a federal judge withdrew from consideration on Monday after video of his Senate confirmation hearing showing him unable to provide answers to rudimentary legal questions went viral last week. Trump accepted Matthew Petersen’s offer to withdraw his nomination as a district court judge in Washington, a White House official said. Petersen, a Republican member of the Federal Election Commission, became the latest of Trump’s judicial nominations to fail as the president seeks to win confirmation of judges who will make the federal judiciary more conservative. “Just because you’ve seen ‘My Cousin Vinny’ doesn’t qualify you to be a federal judge,” Republican Senator John Kennedy, who grilled Petersen during his Dec. 13 confirmation hearing, told WWL-TV, referring to the 1992 comedy film about a novice lawyer. Kennedy, who has been critical of some of Trump’s judicial nominees, asked several basic legal questions that Petersen could not answer. The video was shown on cable news shows and widely viewed on the internet. “While I am honored to have been nominated for this position, it has become clear to me over the past few days that my nomination has become a distraction - and that is not fair to you or your administration,” Petersen wrote in his withdrawal letter to Trump. “I had hoped that my nearly two decades of public service might carry more weight than my two worst minutes on television,” Petersen added. Petersen became the third Trump judicial pick whose nomination foundered in the past week. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said last week Trump’s nominations of Jeff Mateer and Brett Talley would not move forward. Both had faced criticism for controversial statements. Talley was reported by online magazine Slate as having posted online sympathetic comments about the early history of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) white supremacist group. He also failed to disclose that his wife works in the White House counsel’s office, which overseas judicial nominations. Mateer ran into trouble over 2015 speeches including one in which he referred to transgender children as being part of “Satan’s plans,” CNN reported. Despite those setbacks, Trump has made significant progress in filling vacancies on the federal courts with conservative judges, including 12 on the important courts of appeal. He also appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Courts, restoring the high court’s conservative majority. ",0
"EU says needs concrete evidence from Turkey to deem Gulen network as terrorist ANKARA (Reuters) - The European Union does not share Turkey s view that the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen is a terrorist organization and would need to see  substantive  evidence to change its stance, the EU s counter-terrorism coordinator said. The comments by Gilles de Kerchove are likely to infuriate Ankara, which accuses Gulen of masterminding a failed military coup last year, in which more than 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied the charge and condemned the coup. Turkey has long accused its NATO allies, including the United States and Germany, of failing to condemn the abortive putsch strongly enough, saying they appeared more concerned by Ankara s ensuing crackdown on suspected supporters of the coup.  As for FETO, we don t see it as a terrorist organization, and I don t believe the EU is likely to change its position soon,  Kerchove said, using the Turkish government s acronym for Gulen s network.  You need not only circumstantial evidence - like just downloading an app - but concrete substantive data which shows that they were involved...,  he told Reuters in an interview cleared for publication on Thursday. Turkish authorities have detained some 50,000 people, including teachers, police officers, journalists and U.S. consular staff for alleged links to Gulen s network. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. Some have been detained for having downloaded ByLock, a messaging app the government says was used by the coup plotters. Others have been detained for having had telephone calls with ByLock users. Human rights groups and some EU officials accuse Erdogan of using the crackdown to muzzle dissent in Turkey, a charge Ankara denies. It says the scale of the clampdown is justified because the Gulen network threatens national security. Gulen was once an ally of Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party and his movement ran schools, banks and media outlets in Turkey until the two men had a public falling-out in 2013. Germany s BND spy agency has said it is not convinced that Gulen was behind the failed coup, in which rogue soldiers used tanks and helicopters to attack Turkey s parliament and other key targets. Turkey has also sought, so far unsuccessfully, Gulen s extradition from the United States, where the cleric has lived in self-imposed exile since 1999. U.S. officials say their courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition. As of July, Turkey had supplied 84 boxes of documents to the United States for evidence, Ankara s envoy to Washington has said, although he has acknowledged that more concrete evidence of Gulen s direct involvement has remained elusive. Germany, which has sharply criticized the mass arrests in Turkey, has refused to extradite people Ankara says were involved in the plot or linked to Gulen s network.  The decision on extradition is in the hands of all member states, and most of the time the judiciary, the independent judiciary, and they need hard evidence,  Kerchove said. ",0
"Leaders Struggle to Unite House Republicans Behind Health Bill - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   The House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act faced an uncertain fate on Wednesday as conservative Republicans pushed to eliminate federal requirements that health insurance plans provide certain benefits to consumers. House Republican leaders met with members of their party late into the night on Wednesday as they struggled to muster support for the bill, scheduled for a vote on the House floor on Thursday. President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, worked through the day to placate conservative House Republicans who said that the bill did not do enough to lower health insurance costs by reducing federal regulations. The legislation would roll back major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a significantpillar of President Barack Obama’s legacy. But in trying to satisfy conservatives, the Trump administration and House Republican leaders risked jeopardizing support for the bill among more moderate Republicans. On the eve of the crucial vote, party leaders appeared to be short of a majority and were working into the night to whip their members into line. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, expressed optimism on Wednesday night that talks with Republican leaders would lead to revisions to the bill. “We’re encouraged tonight, just based on the real willingness of not only the White House, but our leadership, to make this bill better,” Mr. Meadows said, crediting the personal involvement of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence. But Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania and a leader of a moderate bloc of lawmakers known as the Tuesday Group, said late Wednesday night that he would oppose the bill. “I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for    income and older individuals,” Mr. Dent said. And the powerful conservative network funded by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch issued a direct challenge to the president and said that it would provide financial support to members who voted against the plan. “We will stand with lawmakers who keep their promise and oppose this legislation,” said James Davis, executive vice president of Freedom Partners, the umbrella organization responsible for the Koch brothers’ political efforts. About two dozen conservative Republicans, including Freedom Caucus members, met Wednesday with top administration officials, including Mr. Pence and Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. “I don’t think they changed any minds,” Representative Randy Weber, Republican of Texas, said after the meeting. The tenacity and persistence of the conservatives appeared to give them outsize influence as Mr. Ryan struggled to round up votes for the repeal bill, which faces solid opposition from House Democrats. Supporters of their bill have put their faith in Mr. Trump, whose young presidency could be badly damaged by a public and consequential loss. “When the president calls someone and says, ‘I need your vote on this,’ it’s very hard to say no to the president of the United States when this torpedoes our entire conference, Trump’s entire presidency, and we end up losing the Senate next year and we lose members in the House,” said Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and a top Trump supporter in the House. But conservative opposition was over substance, not politics. Conservatives are upset over the failure of the House bill to repeal a set of regulations in Mr. Obama’s signature health law, which require insurers to cover a base set of benefits, like maternity care, preventive services, wellness checkups and rehabilitative services. These “essential health benefits” raise the cost of insurance and prevent companies from offering   options, the conservatives say. “How can you talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, without repealing the essential health benefits?” asked Representative Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican who attended the meeting with Mr. Pence. Republican leaders say that if the House makes such changes to the bill, it could imperil their ability to push the legislation through the Senate using expedited procedures that neutralize the threat of a filibuster. Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho, likened the swirling cloud of uncertainty to the situation in November 2003, when the House approved a bill adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare after a   vote that lasted nearly three hours in the middle of the night. The bill passed, 220 to 215, after House Republican leaders put down a conservative rebellion. “It’s tough to pass controversial things, especially when Republicans have different ideas,” Mr. Simpson said. Eventually, he predicted, House leaders will get the votes they need, though they may need to tweak the repeal bill. Representative Scott DesJarlais, Republican of Tennessee, said the administration tried to sell the House bill, known as the American Health Care Act, by arguing that it could be improved later in the Senate. But House members rarely relish handing their political fate to the other chamber. “I am more skeptical,” Mr. DesJarlais said. “I like to see what I’m going to get when I vote for it, not promises that I get later. ” Asked if supporters of the bill had the votes to pass it in the House, Mr. DesJarlais said, “I don’t think they do. ” A spokeswoman for the Freedom Caucus, Alyssa Farah, said that more than 25 members of the caucus were “no” votes on the health care measure  —   enough to sink the bill in the House, though that count could not be independently verified. Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, said that despite recent changes to the health care bill, he was unable to vote for it. “This legislation simply won’t lower premiums as much as the American people need, and lowering the cost of coverage is my primary goal,” said Mr. Harris, an anesthesiologist and member of the Freedom Caucus. House leaders were also contending with opposition from more moderate Republicans worried about the toll that the health bill could take in their districts. Representative Dan Donovan of New York, who attended a meeting at the White House with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, said Wednesday that he would vote against the bill. “Recognizing that the status quo is failing isn’t, on its own, a compelling reason to vote ‘yes’ on the current replacement plan,” said Mr. Donovan, the only Republican House member from New York City. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he was sure the House would pass the repeal bill. “Slowly but surely we’re getting there,” he said. “There is no Plan B. There’s Plan A and Plan A. We’re going to get this done. ”",0

"Despair and introspection on U.S. coasts after Trump win BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans in liberal enclaves from New York to San Francisco reacted with shock and despair on Wednesday to Republican businessman Donald Trump’s defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, with many struggling to explain the result to their children. Trump, who had never before run for public office, won on a broad wave of support both from the Republican U.S. heartland and by flipping previously Democratic states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, helping his party protect majorities in both chambers of Congress. The victory stunned residents of major cities up and down the East and West coasts, many of whom had trusted opinion polls that had long predicted a Clinton victory but were proven profoundly wrong by Tuesday’s results. “I’m feeling physical pain. I’m shocked. I’m sad,” said Sofia Huizar, 30, as she waited outside the Manhattan hotel where Clinton conceded her loss on Wednesday morning, some eight hours after Trump declared victory. Huizar, a U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, said she spent much of Tuesday night commiserating with family across the border. “It’s a way to help process the fear,” Huizar said. Trump’s campaign promises have included building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal crossings and to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Others, like Kim Priban, a 38-year-old nurse who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Boston Heights, Ohio, said they had a difficult time breaking the news to their children.  Priban said she had proudly taken her 5-year-old daughter along to vote for Clinton, who would have been the first woman U.S. president, and on Wednesday morning had to discuss the result with her. “I still haven’t quite figured out what to tell my daughter. I’ve been crying all day,” Priban said. “I feel like I have to go out and make my voice heard for women and children.” Priban and Huizar are likely far from alone in the depth of their pain over Clinton’s loss, academic research suggests. A 2015 paper by researchers at Harvard University found that voters who supported Republican Mitt Romney’s unsuccessful White House bid reported sharper spikes in their unhappiness than parents following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre of Connecticut schoolchildren or Boston residents after the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. While many Democrats along the coasts mourned Clinton’s defeat, Trump supporters celebrated the outcome, saying they hoped he would shake up a dysfunctional political system. “The overwhelming majority of Americans want change, and this is a direct result. ... Trump is the disrupter, for better or for worse,” said Kelley Smith, 33, who lives in Chicago and works in software sales. “He’s a little bombastic. I don’t think he’s polished. But I don’t think he’s going to purposefully take our country down.” The divide between the coasts and the heartland, evident not only in the results but also in the social media battles ahead of the election, made the Trump victory more shocking for liberals. Deena Pioli, an attorney from San Francisco, said she had rarely run into people who were not supporting Clinton, and that she now regrets that. “Those of us here in San Francisco and California should not be so safe in our bubble,” she said.   Trump dropped his angry speaking style to take a conciliatory tone when he declared victory early Wednesday morning, saying, “I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.” Clinton and Democratic President Barack Obama sounded similarly restrained. But the breadth of Trump’s win left his opponents urging self-examination. “Folks should have deep humility in this moment,” said civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson on Twitter. “We all have things to learn from how Trump happened.” Karen Parnett, a 48-year-old mother of three in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she had been heartbroken to tell her children about Trump’s win, and said the result illustrated the growing anger of lower-income voters who believe their concerns are being ignored by Washington. “I have too much at stake with three kids to just throw up my hands and weep and say that all is lost,” Parnett said. “There are new realities and we need as a country to reckon with what in the world we are going to do about the disenfranchisement of the white working poor.” (This story has been refiled to fix typo in ninth paragraph) ",0

"ICE Busts 39 MS-13 Members in New York Operation Law enforcement immigration officers and agents joined forces to round up 39 members of the     criminal gang. Six other people were also arrested during the operation. [U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents teamed up in Operation Matador to arrest a total of 45 criminal gang members. In addition to the 39   members, the operation led to the arrest of two Sureños, one member of the 18th Street Gang, one Latin King, one Los Niños Malos, and one with Patria, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from ICE officials. Operation Matador was conducted over a   period of time.  “Transnational gangs like   bring nothing but violence and conflict to our communities and their presence will not be tolerated. Their vicious criminal activities present an ongoing challenge for law enforcement everywhere,” Special Agent in Charge of HIS New York Angel M. Melendez said in a written statement. “It is with the efforts of our federal partners under DHS and the incredible assistance provided by our local law enforcement partnerships with Suffolk County and Nassau County Police Departments that we will continue to dismantle these gangs piece by piece to enhance the safety and security of our communities. ” Officials stated that 20 of the gang members had criminal histories. Some of those offenses include convictions for assault and weapons charges. One of the gang members reportedly has a conviction for larceny and a final order of removal from an immigration judge. Other significant gang members arrested include: “These individuals are members of a violent street gang actively wreaking havoc in the community. This unified effort is about keeping New York citizens safe,” New York ERO Field Office Director Thomas R. Decker said in the statement. “ERO and HSI, along with our law enforcement partners, face no limitations in the apprehension and dismantling of transnational criminal organizations. We will not rest until our communities are safer and individuals like these are brought to justice. ” More than 30 of the arrests came in Suffolk County, which routinely releases criminal aliens from its jail, even if ICE has placed an immigration hold on the suspect. In April, Breitbart News reported on the massacre of four Hispanic young men from Long Island, New York. The bodies of the men were so mutilated, they could only be identified by tattoos. Police eventually tied the murders to  . Breitbart Texas has been covering this violent transnational gang for several years.

At that time, FBI officials indicated members of the   gang were active in at least 42 states and had between 6, 000 and 10, 000 members. Those numbers have increased substantially with the massive influx of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) from Central American countries, particularly El Salvador. On June 10, Breitbart Texas reported the numbers of UACs, particularly from El Salvador, being apprehended at our southern border with Mexico is again on the rise following a   downtrend. Since October 1, 2916, 8005 UACs from El Salvador have been apprehended after crossing the border illegally  —   1, 493 in May alone. This is nearly a fifty percent increase from the previous month. Almost half of those apprehended this month had crossed in the Rio Grande Valley Sector in south Texas. ICE officials stated that of the 39   gang members arrested in Operation Matador, 12 had entered the U. S. as unaccompanied minors. Three other members entered the U. S. under Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Some of those arrested had previously been deported and now face felony charges for illegal   after removal, officials stated. The rise of   violence has also dramatically impacted crime in the nation’s   city, Houston, where Governor Greg Abbott announced in April, the creation of a Texas   Task Force to target these criminal aliens. Breitbart Texas covered the press conference on April 11 of this year in Houston Gov. Abbott announced the expansion of the Texas   Task Force (TAG) and the creation of a technical operations center. Houston is one of the five cities that the FBI has identified to have a large   presence. ICE officials worked with state and county law enforcement officers in conducting the operation. Operation Matador was carried out under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security’s Transnational Organized Crime Initiative.

"Trump urges Senate Republicans to move ahead with healthcare reform WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump urged Senate Republicans on Monday to move ahead this week on a bid to repeal his predecessor’s signature healthcare law, saying any senator who votes against it is telling America “you are fine with the Obamacare nightmare.” “To every member of the Senate I say this: the American people have waited long enough. There’s been enough talk, and no action. Now is the time for action,” Trump said at the White House. He added that people were demanding change, saying, “You’ll see that at the voter booth, believe me.” ",0
"Two Defending Champions, but Two Outlooks, at Wimbledon - The New York Times WIMBLEDON, England  —   The    Kingdom clearly has bigger concerns than a mere tennis tournament, with the focus on the country’s leaving the European Union and on England’s remaining in soccer’s European Championships. It’s rather strange how that timing has worked out. But no matter what is transpiring in the wider, less orderly world, there is still plenty to play for in the bubble of Wimbledon, where the grass  —   at least on Henman Hill  —   looks even greener than usual this year. On the eve of the tournament on Sunday, the defending champions Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams spoke    in the interview room at the All England Club. Neither has played an official event since the French Open. Both sat with their hands folded in front of them. Both spoke more softly and slowly than usual, but only Williams seemed subdued, keeping her answers terse, even to questions that lent themselves to rambling on, and not so subtly checking her watch as the allotted 15 minutes neared an end. She has had a fine season by nearly anyone else’s standards, reaching the finals at the Australian Open and the French Open and remaining No. 1 in the rankings. But it has definitely been a downbeat year for her, with upset losses to Angelique Kerber in Melbourne and to Garbiñe Muguruza in Paris. Williams’s mood on Sunday could be taken two different ways: One, she is still reeling, or two (and much more likely) she is simmering and much more interested in crushing serves and returns and restoring the tennis universe to its natural order than in the    game. “I’m definitely ready to start playing at this point,” she said. “I’m kind of over practicing every day for two hours, then going to the gym. ” When she won here last year, Williams held all four of the Grand Slam singles titles. Now she holds only Wimbledon’s. Djokovic, her dancing partner at last year’s champions dinner, is the one on the   roll now. He’s the first man to hold all four major titles since Rod Laver in 1969 and the player with a chance to do what Williams could not quite manage last year by completing the Grand Slam and winning all four majors in the same calendar year. I asked Williams what she might tell Djokovic after her unsuccessful chase last year, which ended two rounds short of the Grand Slam when she was stunned in the United States Open semifinals by Roberta Vinci. “You know, he has every opportunity to do it,” she said. “I think he’ll get it easy, so he should be fine. ” Easy sounds unlikely, given the pressure and fatigue that will surely build up in a year that also features the Olympics. Less than an hour after Djokovic won the French Open this month for his first Roland Garros title, the former star Henri Leconte walked past the Djokovic camp in the players’ lounge and said theatrically: “Two to go! Two to go! Oh, my God! Two to go!” Marian Vajda, one of Djokovic’s coaches, laughed. This was Leconte, one of tennis’s class clowns, after all. Vajda, in typical fashion, then acknowledged the reality. “Real Grand Slam, now we can think about it,” Vajda said. “This was a real mental breakthrough for Novak, to win in Paris. And now he needs to focus on going to Wimbledon fresh and going for the U. S. Open, and there’s obviously the Olympic Games in the middle, so it’s too many goals in a row. It makes it more complicated. ” More compelling, too, and all the more so because Djokovic surely never gave the Grand Slam too much serious thought earlier in his career. He was too preoccupied with leveling the playing field with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to think about outclassing the field to this degree. Even Djokovic’s biggest supporters  —   his family  —   were not thinking about it. Vajda said he ran into Djokovic’s father, Srdjan, at a restaurant in Paris during the French Open. Srdjan was with a group of friends and asked Vajda to tell the group what Srdjan had told him when they first met. “You told me he will be No. 1,” Vajda replied, “and I started laughing because I thought you were joking with me. And Novak’s father said: ‘No, I was not joking. I knew he was going to be No. 1, knew it, but I forgot one thing. I didn’t know he would be dominating so much in the tennis world one day.’ ” But here Djokovic is, undoubtedly the world’s top player on all surfaces, with a   record against the top 10 during the past two seasons. He has done it, in part, by learning how to conserve his physical and emotional energy  —   unplugging from the game when necessary, which he did again before Wimbledon. “Winning Roland Garros was obviously one of the most memorable and beautiful moments of my career,” said Djokovic, who will face James Ward of Britain in the opening match on Centre Court on Monday. “Also, it took a lot out of me. I thought that it’s more important for me to just rejuvenate and rest a little bit from tennis and then come back preparing for Wimbledon. ” He does not plan to overplay. Defend his title at Wimbledon, and it is entirely possible that he will play only the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and the United States Open in the two months that follow. But there are other temptations, including a Davis Cup quarterfinal versus Britain (and Andy Murray) in July and the Rogers Cup in Toronto, which could serve as a hardcourt   for Rio. The Grand Slam is such a rare prize that it bears sacrificing other worthy goals, as Williams is better placed than anyone to grasp. She has not been the same irresistible force since that loss to Vinci in September, and Wimbledon is full of ghosts as well as big victories for her. Not that she remembers them all. On Sunday, she could not recall any of the details of her first appearance in 1998 (she retired in the third round versus Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain). But she surely remembers losing to Sabine Lisicki in the fourth round in 2013 and to Alizé Cornet in the third round in 2014, just as she surely remembers beating Muguruza in straight sets last year to win her sixth Wimbledon singles title. “This year, I don’t feel as much tension as I usually do,” she said. “Well, there’s some years that I haven’t felt any tension, either. I’m feeling pretty good. I don’t feel any pressure or stress. ” In truth, it was a challenge to sense what Williams was feeling on Sunday, and she will now let her racket do the talking, beginning with her   match on Tuesday versus Amra Sadikovic of Switzerland, 27, who retired in May 2014 but is now back for more and making her Grand Slam debut. Williams, at 34, knows too well that life is full of such surprises, and surprise has been the rule of late in the women’s game, with the   Flavia Pennetta, Kerber and Muguruza winning the past three major titles. “Think about how many women now know that they have an opening,” said Pam Shriver, an ESPN analyst. “During most of the Serena era, the players have felt there was no opening for them,” she continued, “so the question is, who is big enough to walk through it, especially at Wimbledon, where there’s more media and where you better have control of your breathing and know how to manage your nerves more than anywhere else? Because there’s a quietness and an aura about the place, and if you’re not firmly planted with two feet with your confidence, it will knock you off balance. ”",0
"Supreme Court Throws Out Ruling On Obamacare Contraception Mandate WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out an appeals court decision that went against the University of Notre Dame over its religious objections to the Obamacare health law's contraception requirement.

The justices asked the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision in favor of the Obama administration in light of the June 2014 Supreme Court ruling that allowed closely held corporations to seek exemptions from the provision.

The court's action means the February 2014 appeals court ruling that denied the South Bend, Indiana-based Roman Catholic university an injunction against the requirement has been wiped out.

The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known widely as Obamacare, requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women including access to contraception and sterilization.

In the 2014 ruling, the high court said that Hobby Lobby Stores Ltd could, on religious grounds, seek exemptions from the contraception provision.

Days later, in a case similar to the Notre Dame dispute, the Supreme Court allowed a college in Illinois a temporary exemption while litigation continues.

Catholic groups say they should not have to pay for or facilitate access to contraception or abortion because of religious objections.

But courts that have considered the issue since then have found that a compromise aimed at nonprofits with religious affiliations, issued in 2013 and amended in August 2014, did not impose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs' religious beliefs. Religious rights are protected under a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

The Notre Dame case was the only appeals court decision on that issue that pre-dated the Hobby Lobby ruling.

The compromise allows the groups to certify they are opting out, which then forces insurers to pick up the tab.

Notre Dame says the certification process still essentially forces the groups to authorize the coverage for its employees, even if they are not technically paying for it. Religious institutions are exempt from the contraception coverage requirement.

The case is Notre Dame v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-392. (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)",0
"An Appraisal: Leonard Cohen, Master of Meanings and Incantatory Verse - The New York Times Leonard Cohen, who was 82 when he died on Monday, was young once. That can be hard to remember after his years of public,   eminence: touring arenas while he was in his 70s and playing leisurely    shows that seemed to slow down time itself. He intoned his songs with serene gravity, revealing once again how carefully chiseled every one of his quatrains is. And with every line he shared, implicitly and in his lyrics, there was a humbling knowledge of mortality: one that grows even more significant on Mr. Cohen’s final studio album, “You Want It Darker,” which was released less than a month ago. In “Who By Fire,” from 1974, one of his many songs that is both a list and an incantation, he itemized causes and sites of death, getting morbid while keeping a hint of puckishness: Mr. Cohen was aware, always, of every option. In his concerts, Mr. Cohen played the venerable sage, dapper in his suits and precisely angled hats. He was also sly and avuncular, making droll, deadpan comments in his sepulchral voice. He had aged to match the perspective he had brought to his lyrics since the late 1960s: a long view that stretched back to biblical and psychological archetypes and envisioned myth and history  —   and the   economy of Zen koans  —   far more often than the everyday. Perhaps because he was already in his 30s when he set aside novels and poetry for songwriting, he was a   from the start. Mr. Cohen was a monumentally painstaking songwriter who described, in interviews, a process of endless writing and rewriting for his lyrics. By his accounts, he tinkered with some of his songs for years on end. That meticulousness was obvious in the songs he did release, which he did in no great hurry: 14 studio albums in 49 years. Bob Dylan’s   associations were sometimes a   influence, particularly on Mr. Cohen’s   albums, but the Cohen trademark was the   paradox, the finely balanced lyrics that can be deliberately heard (and read) in contradictory ways: reverence or blasphemy, affection or animosity, reportage or mockery, tragedy or comedy. “Everybody Knows,” a dark masterpiece of bitter cynicism from 1988 that Mr. Cohen wrote with the singer Sharon Robinson, opens with politics that still ring unfortunately true: Then, because political battles are not always physically felt, the song’s catalog of betrayals veers toward the personal: “Everybody knows that you’ve been   give or take a night or two. ” As serious as he was, Mr. Cohen was always frisky too. His first albums, especially, are suffused with appreciative eroticism and sensuality: describing a lover with “your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm” in “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye,” or recalling, with explicit details, a tryst with Janis Joplin in “Chelsea Hotel #2,” which has her declaring, “We are ugly but we have the music. ” The Cohen song that became an unlikely pop perennial, “Hallelujah,” veers between biblical allusions and ecstatic sex. In its melody and chord progression, “Hallelujah,” which has been subjected to renditions both humble and bombastic, points to something Mr. Cohen’s countless literary admirers don’t mention: He understood tunes, and he knew they were more than just backdrops to his words. It’s one thing  —   a complicated, prodigious thing  —   to write such fastidious lyrics, and then to mock that fastidiousness by rhyming “Hallelujah” with “what’s it to ya. ” It’s another to carry them in a melody that, once created, seems to sing itself. “Hallelujah” is a   succession of tensions and releases, which stay no less magical despite the way Mr. Cohen analyzes them in the first verse of his lyrics: “the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift. ” Mr. Cohen had to cope with the limitations of his vocal cords. That’s why his first exposure, with songs like the    conundrums of “Famous Blue Raincoat,” came via the prettier voices of singers like Judy Collins. In Mr. Cohen’s early years he was a low tenor, decent enough technically and smart enough as a melody writer to keep his songs where he could sing them. On his debut album, “Songs of Leonard Cohen,” the producer John Simon gave Mr. Cohen exactly as much counterpoint as he needed, although Mr. Cohen complained, in a 1967 interview with The Village Voice, “They tried to make my songs into music. ” Later, as his voice plummeted down to a   bass register, he used the voices of women  —   as angels, consorts, muses, ghosts  —   to provide melodies around him. Mr. Cohen was clearly aware of how many of his album titles insisted that his work was music above all: “Songs from a Room,” “Songs of Love and Hate,” “Recent Songs,” “Ten New Songs. ” Sometimes, he tried to be palatable to pop radio. He delved widely across idioms, writing not just   folk and pop but tunes that hinted at rock, blues, country, klezmer, Viennese waltzes and Greek rebetika  —   even disco on the   trenchant “I’m Your Man” in 1988. And in one of the most improbable (and mismatched) collaborations in pop history, Mr. Cohen made his 1977 album “Death of a Ladies’ Man” with Phil Spector. Mr. Cohen could frustrate his listeners by treating some albums, like the 2004 record “Dear Heather,” merely as skeletal demos. One of the benefits of his   touring was that he rescued some songs from misbegotten studio arrangements. On his final studio albums  —   in 2012, 2014 and 2016  —   he collaborated with an unexpected and adept fan: the producer Patrick Leonard, who wrote and produced “Like a Prayer,” among many other songs, with Madonna. Yet it’s inevitable that Mr. Cohen will be remembered above all for his lyrics. They are terse and acrobatic, scriptural and bawdy, vividly descriptive and enduringly ambiguous, never far from either a riddle or a punch line. “There is a crack in  ’s how the light gets in,” he advised in “Anthem. ” His final ruminations on his last album, “You Want It Darker,” were on mortality, love and a divinity that he faced and questioned to the very end. “Steer your way through the pain that is far more real than  ’s smashed the cosmic model, that blinded every   please don’t make me go there, though there be a God or not,” he intoned in “Steer Your Way. ” In his last songs, as always, he sought stark truth before comfort.",0
"UK's Johnson in Iran talks to lobby for jailed aid worker DUBAI (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson flew to Tehran on Saturday to seek the release of a jailed British-Iranian aid worker. The Foreign Office said Johnson spoke  frankly  with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif about  consular cases of dual nationals  such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who Britain says was visiting family on holiday when she was jailed by Iran for attempting to overthrow the government. The case has taken on domestic political importance in Britain, especially since Johnson said last month that Zaghari-Ratcliffe trained journalists, which her employer denies. Johnson later apologized. Opponents have called for him to resign if his comments lead to her serving longer in prison. Johnson is also expected to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday to discuss bilateral and regional issues, a Foreign Office official said, during just the third visit by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. Talks with Zarif were  constructive , Johnson s office said, despite differences between the two countries.  They both spoke frankly about the obstacles in the relationship, including the Foreign Secretary s concerns about the consular cases of British-Iranian dual nationals,  a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in a statement. The two-day visit takes place against a complex backdrop of historical, regional and bilateral tensions. Johnson stressed Britain s support for Iran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in the meeting, the spokeswoman said. International sanctions against Iran have only recently been lifted as part of the multilateral nuclear deal to curb Tehran s disputed uranium enrichment program.  That deal is under threat after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to decertify Iran s compliance with its terms. Johnson told Zarif he believed the deal should be fully implemented. Johnson also met Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran s Supreme National Security Council, and parliament speaker Ali Larijani during the first day of his two-day visit, Iran s state news agency IRNA reported. The Foreign Office statement did not mention Zaghari-Ratcliffe by name, although Johnson has vowed to leave  no stone unturned  in Britain s efforts to free her.  A project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, she was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not the only dual national being held in Iran, but has become the most high-profile case. The Thomson Reuters Foundation is a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. It says Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been told she will appear in court on Dec. 10, her husband Richard has said. The visit is a test of Johnson s ability to navigate a political landscape littered with potential pitfalls. Iran s 1979 Islamic Revolution turned it into a pariah state for most of the West and many Middle Eastern neighbors. Britain has voiced its continued support for the nuclear deal but is one of a number of Western powers voicing concerns about Tehran s  destabilizing  influence in the region. ",0
"Sri Lanka court jails top former senior officials for graft COLOMBO (Reuters) - A Sri Lankan court on Thursday jailed and fined two top officials in former president Mahinda Rajapaksa s government for misappropriation of funds, a lawyer said, the first convictions in a series of investigations into official corruption. The government of President Maithripala Sirisena unseated Rajapaksa in 2015 on promises to expose corruption and is under pressure to follow through. Sirisena s administration has been probing money laundering and misappropriation of state property in more than 50 cases, but no one had been convicted until Thursday. Colombo High Court sentenced Lalith Weeratunga, former secretary to Rajapaksa, and Anusha Palpita, ex-head of the state-run Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, to three years of  rigorous imprisonment , or jail with hard labor, and fined them 52 million rupees ($340,760) each. Election monitors had complained that the state fund was used to influence voters ahead of 2015 presidential polls. Kalinga Indratissa, the lawyer who appeared on behalf of Weeratunga and Palpita, told Reuters the two would appeal. Two of Rajapaksa s sons, Namal and Yoshitha, have been arrested and released on bail over money laundering allegations.  His brother, Basil, who headed the economic development ministry, has also been arrested at least three times - twice over suspicion of misuse of anti-poverty funds and a once over suspicion of laundering money and released on bail. Rajapaksa and his family deny any wrongdoing.  Rajapaksa was president for a decade until January 2015 and is popular among ethnic majority Sinhala Buddhists who credit him with ending the 26-year-war against minority Tamil separatist rebels in 2009.

"U.S. blacklists 10 Venezuelans for corruption, undermining state vote WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday sanctioned 10 more Venezuelan officials, including several government ministers, who it said had helped Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s attempts to undermine democratic rule in the country. “These individuals are associated with undermining electoral processes, media censorship, or corruption in government-administered food programs in Venezuela,” the U.S. Treasury said in a statement. On Oct. 15, state elections were held in Venezuela. The list of officials includes Julian Rodriguez Diaz, Venezuela’s ambassador to Italy; Ernesto Emilio Villegas Poljak, Venezuela’s new minister of culture; Freddy Bernal Rosales,  Venezuela’s minister for urban agriculture; and Manuel Fernandez Melendez, who heads the country’s National Telephone Company.

"Trump trade office takes aggressive view of WTO rules: document WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration said on Wednesday that it will take aggressive action to combat other countries’  unfair trade practices and may defy World Trade Organization rulings that it views as interfering with U.S. sovereignty In an annual trade policy agenda document, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said the administration “will not tolerate” unfair trade practices that distort markets, including currency manipulation, unfair government subsidies, intellectual property theft and state-owned enterprises. The document publicly released to Congress on Wednesday signals that the administration may try to push the limits of what is acceptable under WTO rules in its quest to make good on campaign promises to slash U.S. trade deficits with China and Mexico, and bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. The document represents a departure from the Obama administration’s strict adherence to WTO compliance in its challenges to unfair foreign trade practices. “Unlike earlier presidents, Trump is signaling a willingness to impose import restrictions — especially against a country like China — where the justification under WTO rules for doing so may be highly questionable,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “The downside of the United States going down this path is that it is likely that other countries will follow suit immediately,” Bown added. The USTR document said it was not in the United States’ interest to let some WTO rulings undermine the use of effective remedies that the Geneva-based trade body expressly allows to fight unfair trade.    “Accordingly, the Trump administration will act aggressively as needed to discourage this type of behavior — and encourage true market competition,” the USTR said in the document. Laying out many of Trump’s trade plans in writing for the first time, the document said the Trump administration plans to strictly enforce U.S. trade laws, defend U.S. national sovereignty over trade policy, and use all possible leverage to open foreign markets to U.S. exports, the document said.  It makes clear the Trump administration’s view that U.S. law supersedes WTO rules — a view that could be invoked should Congress adopt a border tax adjustment plan to impose new taxes on imports that is later challenged as violating WTO tariff rules by other member countries. “The Trump administration will aggressively defend American sovereignty over matters of trade policy,” the report said. The nominee to be Trump’s top trade negotiator, veteran steel industry lawyer Robert Lighthizer, in 2010 advocated “aggressive interpretations of WTO provisions that might help us deal with Chinese mercantilism.” Lighthizer is awaiting confirmation by the U.S. Senate. He served as a deputy USTR in the Reagan administration, helping to negotiate import quotas on Japanese goods in the 1980s, with the help of powerful trade law provisions that have largely gone unused since the WTO was launched in 1995.

"Kuwait's ruler accepts cabinet resignation: state news agency KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait s ruling emir accepted the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet on Monday, state news agency KUNA reported, asking them to continue important duties until a new cabinet is sworn in. Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Mubarak al-Sabah tendered his resignation earlier on Monday to the Emir, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who has the final say in state matters. Local media, quoting members of parliament, said a cabinet shakeup had been expected. Lawmakers were preparing this week to discuss a no-confidence vote in Information Minister Sheikh Mohammed al-Sabah after he was questioned over violations of budgetary and legislative rules, Kuwait Times said in a report.

"Zimbabwe's Mugabe sacks VP seen as top succession candidate HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s President Robert Mugabe fired Emmerson Mnangagwa as vice president on Monday for showing  traits of disloyalty , his information minister said, abruptly removing a favorite to succeed the 93-year-old leader. Mnangagwa s removal provides a boost for Mugabe s wife, Grace, who has been a vocal critic of the vice president and is also seen as a potential successor to her husband.  The vice president has consistently and persistently exhibited traits of disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability,  Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo told reporters.  It had become evident that his conduct in his discharge of his duties had become inconsistent with his official responsibilities.  Mnangagwa s top aide Christopher Gwatidzo said he had not seen the statement by Khaya Moyo and declined to say whether the vice president had been at his office on Monday.  Grace, 52, nicknamed  Gucci Grace  for her love of shopping, called Mnangagwa a  coup plotter  and a  coward  on Sunday in a speech that inflamed an already bad-tempered rift in the ruling Zanu-PF party. It followed a speech by Mugabe at a rally on Saturday where he publicly rebuked his deputy for the first time. The reaction of the military could be key. Some army generals backed Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe and have publicly said they will not allow someone who did not fight in the 1970s independence war to rule. Grace did not fight in that war. Grace made international headlines in August when a South African model said the Zimbabwean first lady had whipped her with an electric cable in a Johannesburg hotel suite. Grace denied the allegations. The fight over the future control of ZANU-PF has overshadowed an economic crisis marked by chronic shortages of cash and spiraling prices of goods that has raised fears of a return to hyperinflation. Mnangagwa was Mugabe s protege and had been at his side through five decades of prison, guerrilla war and then post-liberation government, and questions are being raised about what caused the fallout between the two men. By firing Mnangagwa, Mugabe has removed one of his last remaining liberation war comrades who have stood by him since independence from Britain in 1980. However, Grace said on Sunday Mnangagwa had always been plotting against her husband, even months after independence. Mnangagwa s biggest undoing may well have been his vocal supporters, who kept prodding Mugabe to step down. Mugabe has a history of punishing ambition in ZANU-PF. Relations also cooled between the two men in August after suggestions by Mnangagwa s allies that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes. That Mnangagwa s expulsion was announced by a government minister and not the chief secretary to the president and cabinet also spoke to the deterioration in the relationship. Mugabe plans to contest elections due next year and will likely face a weakened and fractured opposition. His main rival Morgan Tsvangirai has been in and out of a South African hospital after announcing he had colon cancer in 2016. ",0
"France raises prospect of new sanctions on Iran over ballistic program PARIS (Reuters) - France s foreign ministry suggested on Monday that new sanctions could be imposed on Iran if needed over its ballistic missile program.  Iran rejected on Sunday a call by French President Emmanuel Macron for talks on Tehran s ballistic missiles, saying they were defensive and unrelated to a nuclear agreement with world powers.  As you know, the European Union has already placed sanctions on Iranian entities involved in the ballistic program,  foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne said. She was responding when asked to clarify comments made by Macron during a trip to the United Arab Emirates last week about the prospects of possible sanctions with regard to those activities.  If needed, new sanctions could be taken,  she said.  The United States accused Iran on Tuesday of supplying Yemen s Houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into Saudi Arabia in July and called for the United Nations to hold Tehran accountable for violating two U.N. Security Council resolutions. Saudi Arabia and its allies accuse Iran of supplying missiles and other weapons to the Houthis, saying the arms were not present in Yemen before conflict broke out there in 2015. Iran denies the charges and blames the conflict on Riyadh. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will be in the Saudi capital later this week and intends to travel to Iran before the end of the month.  The political dialogue between France and Iran is active and makes it possible to address all topics, including strategic and regional issues,  Romatet-Espagne said.  Mr Le Drian will have a firm dialogue when he goes to Iran.  ",0
"'God bless you', Netanyahu tells Guatemalan president over Jerusalem embassy move JERUSALEM/GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Guatemala with a  God bless you  on Monday for deciding to move its embassy to Jerusalem, while the Palestinians said the Central American country was  on the wrong side of history . In an official Facebook post on Sunday, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said he had chosen to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv - siding with the United States in a dispute over Jerusalem s status - after talking to Netanyahu. [L1N1OO0F7] U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Dec. 6, reversing decades of U.S. policy and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies. On Thursday, 128 countries rebuked Trump by backing a non-binding U.N. General Assembly resolution calling on the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem.  God bless you, my friend, President Jimmy Morales, God bless both our countries, Israel and Guatemala,  Netanyahu said, switching to English, in remarks to a weekly meeting of his Likud party faction in parliament. Guatemala and neighboring Honduras were two of only a handful of countries to join Israel and the United States, which has pledged to move its embassy to Jerusalem, in voting against the U.N. resolution. The United States is an important source of assistance to Guatemala and Honduras, and Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that supported the U.N. resolution. The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they want to establish in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki as saying that Morales was  dragging his country to the wrong side of history by committing a flagrant violation of international law . Prior to 1980, Guatemala - along with Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Haiti, The Netherlands, Panama, Venezuela and Uruguay - maintained an embassy in Jerusalem. Israel s passage in June 1980 of a law proclaiming Jerusalem its  indivisible and eternal capital  led to a U.N. Security Council resolution calling upon those countries to move their embassies to Tel Aviv, prompting their transfer. Israel s ambassador to Guatemala, Matty Cohen, said on Army Radio that no date had been set for the embassy move,  but it will happen after  the United States relocates its own embassy to Jerusalem. U.S. officials have said that move could take at least two years. ",0
"Kansai Electric to scrap two reactors in latest blow for Japan's nuclear sector TOKYO (Reuters) - Kansai Electric Power Co said on Friday it will decommission two 38-year-old reactors at its Ohi nuclear plant as Japan s electricity industry struggles to cope with new safety standards imposed after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The widely expected announcement brings to 14 the number of reactors being scrapped since the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. More than six years on, Japan is still turning away from nuclear power in the face of technical problems, public opposition, court challenges and unfavorable economics. Most of Japan s reactors remain shut, with only four operating, while they undergo relicensing processes in a bit to meet new standards set after the Fukushima crisis highlighted shortcomings in regulation. Kansai Electric will now scrap the No. 1 and No. 2 reactors at the Ohi plant, some 86 kilometers (53 miles) from Osaka, western Japan, where the utility is based. Shut since 2011, the reactors have capacity of 1,175 megawatts each, began operations in 1979 and were near the end of their standard operating life of 40 years. A Kansai Electric spokeswoman said that costs in meeting the new safety standards were not a factor behind the decision, but technical difficulties were.  The containment vessels of these reactors are smaller than other reactors in Japan, and a need to beef up the walls to meet the standards would make the work zones even more cramped, making it difficult for prompt repairs in case of troubles,  the spokeswoman said. The move means Japan is likely to soon be eclipsed by China as the third biggest nuclear power sector in the world - by reactor numbers - after the United States and France. Japan now has 42 reactors, including the two to be decommissioned at Ohi, compared with 38 in China, which has nearly 20 more under construction, while the U.S. and France have 99 and 58 respectively, according to the International Energy Agency. Kansai Electric was the most reliant on nuclear energy among Japan s atomic operators, using reactors for nearly half of its electricity generation before the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, when reactors melted down following a giant earthquake and tsunami. Two other reactors at the Ohi site remain closed. While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s government is keen to restore a power source that provided about a third of electricity supply before the Fukushima crisis, Japan s public remains deeply skeptical over industry assurances on safety. Anti-nuclear campaigners and residents are increasingly using courts to block restarts and push for plants to close. A Japanese court last week ordered Shikoku Electric Power Co not to restart one of its reactors, overturning a lower court decision in the first instance of a higher court blocking the operation of nuclear plant. Residents have lodged injunctions against most nuclear plants across Japan. ",0
"Suburban G.O.P. Voters Sour on Party, Raising Republican Fears for 2018 - The New York Times ALPHARETTA, Ga.  —   A gray mood has settled over   voters in some of the country’s most reliably Republican congressional districts, as the party’s stumbles in Washington demoralize them and leave lawmakers scrambling to energize   supporters in a series of   elections. While the next nationwide elections are not until 2018, Republicans have grown fearful that these voters are recoiling from what they see as lamentable conditions in Washington: a government entirely in Republican hands that has failed to deliver on fundamental goals like overhauling the health care system. Early missteps by President Trump and congressional leaders have weighed heavily on voters from the party’s more affluent wing, anchored in    suburbs around major cities in the South and Midwest. Never beloved in these precincts, Mr. Trump appears to be struggling to maintain support from certain voters who backed him last year mainly as a way of defeating Hillary Clinton. Interviews with   voters in four suburban districts  —   in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and New Jersey  —   revealed a sour outlook on the party. These voters, mainly white professionals, say they expected far more in the way of results by now, given the Republican grip on power in the capital. In opinion polls, they consistently give Mr. Trump mediocre approval ratings, even as he remains solidly popular with   whites. In the past,   presidents have suffered grievous losses in midterm elections, when their party’s voters have stayed home while the opposition party has marched to the barricades. Former President Barack Obama saw Democrats lose 63 House seats in 2010 after Republicans and disaffected independents stampeded to the polls and grumbling Democrats did not. It is too early to say if the same dynamic is afflicting Mr. Trump. But already, Republicans have strained to prop up their candidates in a pair of special House elections in the areas around Atlanta and Wichita, Kan. both in districts that have voted overwhelmingly Republican in past congressional races. Republicans spent nearly $100, 000 in   ads boosting Ron Estes, a candidate in Kansas, who won a relatively narrow victory Tuesday night as turnout from the party’s voters slumped. Wary national Democrats invested little money in the race, prompting criticism from activists seeking to fight Mr. Trump’s party on every possible front. Republicans may face a tougher test next week in Georgia, where both parties have poured millions into contesting the seat vacated by Tom Price, Mr. Trump’s new health and human services secretary. At a   shopping mall outside Atlanta, Eric Riehm, 48, said he was beginning to question the point of casting his ballot for Republicans. “The vote seems to matter less and less, because nothing can be done, just like repealing Obamacare,” said Mr. Riehm, who works in information technology sales and voted for Mr. Trump. That malaise cuts across regional lines: In the New Jersey district held by Representative Leonard Lance, a Republican, Joe Boyle, 61, said he took a dim view of Mr. Trump but still hoped he would turn things around. Mr. Boyle, who said he usually votes Republican, faulted the party for failing to “do the homework” on health care, and criticized lawmakers for focusing on their own interests instead of forging bipartisan agreements. “It’s all about ‘me,’ not about the better good of the overall population,” said Mr. Boyle, who recently retired as a marketing executive at Johnson  Johnson. Of Mr. Trump, he added: “He’s a mess. ” Where Democratic activists have flocked to   races, hustling to volunteer, donate money and quickly cast their ballots in   periods, Republicans have seen no comparable energy on their side. They have taken special measures to drum up interest: In Kansas, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas held a   rally to draw attention to the race, and Mr. Trump praised Mr. Estes on Twitter on Tuesday morning. But in an illustration of the rising frustration among    Republicans, Mr. Cruz received his loudest ovation when he rebuked his own party. “We have a Republican president, we have a Republican House, we have a Republican Senate  —   how about we act like it!” he demanded. Mr. Estes ultimately won by 7 points, compared with a nearly   victory margin last fall for the district’s previous congressman, Mike Pompeo, who now leads the C. I. A. And the enthusiasm gap between the parties was on vivid display: Mr. Estes won 62 percent fewer votes than Mr. Pompeo did last fall, while the Democratic vote was only 32 percent lower than in November. Should Republican voters remain so demoralized  —   and Democrats so fired up  —   it could imperil dozens of congressional seats that are usually safe. Midterm elections typically turn on which party is more enthusiastic about sending a message in the past special elections have served as political omens, like when former Senator Scott Brown’s upset win in Massachusetts in 2010 foreshadowed a building conservative wave. Republican anxieties run deeper than just the House. The gloomy environment has hampered their recruiting in a number of   Senate seats, alarming the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, according to Republican officials who have spoken to him, who insisted on anonymity to describe those conversations. Joel McElhannon, a Republican strategist in Georgia, said intraparty wounds from the presidential race remained raw in areas Republicans badly need to win, making it difficult for them to turn out their voters. “It makes it hard to energize the broader Republican base when there are still these unresolved conflicts,” said Mr. McElhannon, predicting: “You’ll see it in various suburbanized districts throughout the country. ” Far from Atlanta, along the shoreline of Lake Minnetonka, Minn.  —   where the accents could scarcely be more different, but the taste in   cars and   politics is the same  —   voters in Representative Erik Paulsen’s   district voiced a similar sense of unease. Mr. Paulsen has been   easily since managing a victory the year Mr. Obama was first elected president. But Hillary Clinton won his district by 10 points in November, making it terrain that could turn competitive if centrist voters recoil from the G. O. P. That would mean a   insurrection from the type of voters strolling along Lake Street in Wayzata or dropping off their dogs at the Lulu and Luigi grooming parlor, as Jackie Carley did with Tiny Bubbles and Viggo, two of her rescues. Ms. Carley, a   moderate, said she would be more likely to support a congressman who would slow or halt the president’s agenda. “I’m a Minnesota person so I don’t want to be rude, but I’m not a fan,” Ms. Carley, a     said of Mr. Trump. Others were less diplomatic. “It’s a mess,” said Gretchen Gilbertson, 51, a    mother out walking her own dog, Pancake. “Congress can’t get anything done, and our president is a buffoon. ” Ms. Gilbertson vowed to do whatever she could to send Mr. Trump a message of disapproval in next year’s election. Paul Anderson, a state senator from nearby Plymouth, Minn. said voters there would judge their congressman on his own record. But for Mr. Paulsen to win   Mr. Anderson suggested, he would probably “have to separate himself at some point from Trump. ” It remains to be seen if Democrats can fully exploit the turbulent environment. They hoped last fall that Mr. Trump’s unpopularity would drag down   Republican candidates across the country, but the party won full control of government. And Democrats may face a tricky balancing act if the explosion of energy on the left collides with the native sensitivities of the    districts they aim to win. Representative Josh Gottheimer, a moderate Democrat who captured a   seat in the New Jersey suburbs last November, said he believed even some conservatives would be “  to voting for Democrats, with the right approach. ” “You have to find a very     approach and one that is not ideologically rigid on either side,” Mr. Gottheimer said. “People are so fired up on the left, too, you have to make sure you are responsive there as well. ” In Georgia, the Democrat running for Congress, Jon Ossoff, has tried to walk that line, promising in ads to check Mr. Trump’s power, while also pledging to cut wasteful spending. He faces a fractious array of Republicans in an open primary on Tuesday. While the district easily   Mr. Price, Mr. Trump barely carried it against Mrs. Clinton. Strolling briskly past Banana Republic and Orvis storefronts, Helen Thompson, 72, said she was dismayed that Republican disorder had endangered the seat. “I think the Republican Party needs to get together  —   they need to get their    together,” she said. “I love Donald Trump, but I just wish he’d keep his mouth shut sometimes and I wish he’d listen to the people who know what they’re doing. ” Ms. Thompson, who worked at a brokerage firm before retiring, said she had voted early in the special election for Dan Moody, a former state senator, from a throng of candidates that includes Karen Handel, a former county commissioner in Fulton County, and Judson Hill, a former state senator. Other voters were less committed: Edward Holben, 62, an engineer on his way into Whole Foods, said he was not following the race closely but expected to vote Republican. Yet Mr. Holben said he was turned off by partisan rancor in Washington, and unsure of Mr. Trump’s ability to enact major legislation. He called the attempt to restructure the health care system so inept he was unsure Republicans were ever determined to pass it. “You want a   rating?” Mr. Holben asked of the Congress. “How about a  ?”",0
"Ex-Cuomo Aides Charged in Federal Corruption Inquiry - The New York Times Federal corruption charges were announced on Thursday against two former close aides to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a senior state official and six other people, in a blow to the governor’s innermost circle and a repudiation of the way his prized upstate economic development programs were managed. The charges against the former aides, Joseph Percoco and Todd R. Howe, and the state official, Alain Kaloyeros, were the culmination of a   federal investigation into the Cuomo administration’s efforts to lure jobs and businesses to upstate New York’s limping economy by furnishing billions of dollars in state funds to developers from Buffalo to Albany. In doing so, says a   criminal complaint unsealed on Thursday, Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe sought to enrich themselves through bribes, using their positions to help particular companies receive “hundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts and other official state benefits. ” The charges mark the second major inquiry of the Cuomo administration by the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan eight months ago, after investigating Mr. Cuomo’s handling of an anticorruption panel that he had created and abruptly shut down, Mr. Bharara said there was “insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime. ” At a news conference at which he announced the charges, Mr. Bharara was asked if he would essentially give Mr. Cuomo a “clean bill of health” again. “There are no allegations of any wrongdoing or misconduct by the governor, anywhere in this complaint,” Mr. Bharara replied. “That’s all I’m going to say. ” If the charges did not hit Mr. Cuomo directly, they did hit him in a peripheral and personal manner: Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe were both loyalists of Mr. Cuomo and his father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, for whom they had also worked. Andrew Cuomo once referred to Mr. Percoco as “my father’s third son, who I sometimes think he loved the most. ” Mr. Cuomo had also spoken highly of Dr. Kaloyeros, depicting him as a visionary in the field of nanotechnology, which Mr. Cuomo has heralded as a potential boon for the state economy. Mr. Bharara’s office and F. B. I. agents in Buffalo had been examining whether state officials awarded lucrative projects to a few favored developers who had donated to the political campaigns of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. One major area of interest was the administration’s plan to inject $1 billion in state funds into   factories, research facilities and other projects, known together as the Buffalo Billion. The resulting investigation yielded a rich narrative of three trusted counselors to Mr. Cuomo conspiring to help the favored contractors, rigging bids and doling out other favorable treatment. The complaint also portrayed the defendants as trying to conceal the schemes, sometimes in unusual ways. In emails and other correspondence, Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe referred to bribe money as “ziti,” a term used in “The Sopranos,” the complaint says. Mr. Percoco, Mr. Howe and others also called one another “Herb” as a term of endearment, while discussing the arrangement. Mr. Bharara said at a news conference on Thursday that he hoped the case would go to trial “so that all New Yorkers can see, in gory detail, what their state government has been up to. ” Mr. Percoco, who had served as Mr. Cuomo’s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315, 000 in bribes from 2012 to 2016 from two companies: Competitive Power Ventures, an energy company that was seeking state approval to build a power plant in the Hudson Valley, and COR Development, a major developer in the Syracuse area that ended up with several large   economic development projects. The bribes were arranged by Mr. Howe, who counted both companies among his clients, the complaint said. Mr. Howe is cooperating with the investigation, prosecutors said, and pleaded guilty this week to extortion, wire fraud and related conspiracy charges. His lawyer, Richard J. Morvillo, would say only that his client “has accepted responsibility for his actions and will testify truthfully if called upon. ” In one instance cited in the complaint, prosecutors say Mr. Howe sent an email to Dr. Kaloyeros saying he had “vitals for Buffalo and Syracuse friends. ” He was working with a prominent corporate donor, LPCiminelli, a builder based in Buffalo, to create a request for proposals that effectively made LPCiminelli the only eligible bidder. Neither the energy company nor the developers in Buffalo and Syracuse are named in the complaint, but several defendants charged are among the companies’ top officials. They include Peter Galbraith Kelly Jr. who oversaw lobbying and public relations for Competitive Power Ventures, which is based in Maryland and Massachusetts Steven Aiello, the president of COR Development and Joseph Gerardi, another executive at COR. The complaint also charges Louis Ciminelli, the founder of LPCiminelli and Michael Laipple and Kevin Schuler, two other LPCiminelli executives. Mr. Kelly is accused of offering and paying Mr. Percoco more than $287, 000 in bribes in exchange for Mr. Percoco’s help. The payments were made to Lisa   Mr. Percoco’s wife, who was ostensibly employed as a consultant to Competitive Power Ventures’s educational outreach arm starting in 2012. Competitive Power Ventures wanted Mr. Percoco’s help obtaining a state contract worth approximately $100 million to finance its power plant in the Hudson Valley, as well as millions of dollars in energy credits for a power plant it was building in New Jersey. The COR executives, Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi, were accused of giving Mr. Percoco about $35, 000 in bribes to use his position in the governor’s office to promote the company’s economic development projects. According to the complaint, they sought Mr. Percoco’s help in reversing a decision by the state’s economic development agency that would have forced COR  —   Mr. Cuomo’s largest donor in central New York  —   to make an expensive labor peace agreement pushing the state to release payments that it owed to COR and getting a $5, 000 raise for Mr. Aiello’s son, who worked for Mr. Percoco at the governor’s office. The charges in the complaint included bribery, extortion under color of official right, and wire fraud and honest services fraud conspiracies. The defendants appeared in federal courts in Manhattan, Syracuse and Buffalo on Thursday and were ordered released on bond. The expected charges against Mr. Percoco were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Percoco’s lawyer, Barry A. Bohrer, characterized the prosecution as “an overreach of classic proportions,” adding that a Supreme Court decision in June that overturned the corruption conviction of former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia established that his client’s conduct was lawful. “Mr. Percoco performed services honestly and within the bounds of the law at all times,” Mr. Bohrer said. A lawyer for Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi declined to comment. Mr. Kelly’s lawyer, Daniel M. Gitner, said his client was innocent and “will be exonerated. ” LPCiminelli, citing its three executives named in the complaint, said it was “confident that all company officials acted appropriately and legally” and would be vindicated. Virtually all the   projects were shaped under the umbrella of the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute and its subsidiaries. The institute is headed by Dr. Kaloyeros, a physicist who has become something of an economic development guru in Albany. Dr. Kaloyeros had been given free rein by Mr. Cuomo to conceive of   economic development projects that could create jobs across the state. Michael C. Miller, a lawyer for Dr. Kaloyeros, said his client was innocent and “looks forward to being exonerated. ” Dr. Kaloyeros also was hit with separate charges on Thursday filed by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. Dr. Kaloyeros and Joseph Nicolla of Columbia Development, an   firm, were accused of colluding to make sure Columbia was awarded contracts to build multiple SUNY Polytechnic projects. Mr. Cuomo said Dr. Kaloyeros had been suspended without pay. When news of the investigation into the governor’s former aides broke in April, his office quickly cut ties to both men and ordered its own internal investigation. The results of that inquiry have not been released. Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Thursday that if the allegations were true, he would be “saddened and profoundly disappointed. ” “I hold my administration to the highest level of integrity. I have zero tolerance for abuse of the public trust from anyone,” he said. “If anything, a friend should be held to an even higher standard. ”",0
"The delay over Loretta Lynch’s confirmation isn’t about bias Let’s get a few things straight about the delay in confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general. It’s outrageous. It also has nothing to do with her race or gender.

Contriving prejudice where none exists demeans the importance of fighting discrimination. And it demeans those who drop such ugly hints.

To wit, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who complained that “the first African American woman nominated to be attorney general is asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar” — this after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) held her nomination hostage to action on a stalled human trafficking bill.

Oh, please. I’m not in the habit of agreeing with Rich Lowry of National Review, but opposing Lynch is no more race-based than Durbin’s own opposition to the nomination of Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state.

That’s not to say that lawmakers are bias-free. This is impossible to prove, but to watch Attorney General Eric Holder testify before Congress makes me think that, at times, he is treated with less respect than if he were white.

But relations between Holder and congressional Republicans are badly frayed; it is in those fraught moments of tension that prejudices, perhaps subconscious, emerge. There was no such atmosphere during the Lynch hearings.

Same with gender. Hillary Clinton raised the subject last week, tweeting, “Congressional trifecta against women today: . . . Blocking great nominee, 1st African American woman AG, for longer than any AG in 30 years . . . ”

Please, again. I’d like to see one smidgen of evidence that Lynch’s gender is working against her.

So the Lynch delay is about ideology. But not her ideology — President Obama’s. And the Justice Department’s. The case against Lynch is the case against the president’s executive action on immigration and the fact that Lynch said she agreed with the Justice Department’s analysis of their legality.

Which raises the question: How could Republican senators reasonably expect Lynch to take a different view? How could they expect Obama to name any nominee who differed? If they can’t, what is the point — other than as a vehicle for expressing pique — of opposing Lynch?

There’s a legitimate argument about whether the president’s actions went too far. I don’t blame Republicans for chafing at them or for being frustrated at their inability to do much in response.

Holding up spending bills in a fit of temper over Obama’s immigration moves is bad for the country and self-destructive. The courts represent an unlikely avenue of relief. So the Lynch nomination offers one tempting way for Republicans to vent frustration with what they view as executive overreach.

“The Senate shouldn’t confirm any attorney general nominee, from whatever party, of whatever race, ethnicity or gender identification, who believes the president can rewrite the nation’s laws at will,” Lowry wrote in a column for Politico , blithely overstating Lynch’s (and Obama’s) position.

Lowry acknowledged that the ironic result of his approach would be to leave the much-reviled Holder in place. “But there’s no helping that,” he added. “The principle that would be upheld is the Senate not giving its imprimatur to an attorney general who thinks its lawmaking role is optional.”

What about the principle of the Senate deciding that its confirming role is optional? If senators have a serious problem with the president’s selection for a particular job — if they believe the nominee lacks experience, is temperamentally unsuited or is ideologically too far outside the mainstream — they have the constitutional right to reject the choice.

But that’s not Republicans’ beef with Lynch. Their beef with Lynch is that she is Obama’s nominee and shares his views.

In the end, whenever that finally comes, Lynch appears to have enough Republican support to squeeze through — perhaps with Vice President Biden casting the deciding vote. This lets Republicans have their tantrum without being responsible for the logical consequences of their position.

Last week, McConnell refused to bring up Lynch’s nomination while the Senate was stalemated over a human trafficking bill and abortion politics. This week the Senate is busying itself debating a budget that will never be put in place. Then it takes two weeks off.

By which point Lynch’s nomination will have languished for more than five months. Enough. It’s long past time for the Senate to do its job, however grudgingly.

"New Photos Cast Doubt on China’s Vow Not to Militarize Disputed Islands - The New York Times When President Xi Jinping of China visited President Obama at the White House last September, he startled many with reassuring words about his intentions for the Spratly Islands, a contested area where the Chinese government has been piling dredged sand and concrete atop reefs for the past few years and building housing and runways on them. “China does not intend to pursue militarization,” Mr. Xi said, referring to the area as the Nansha Islands, a Chinese name for what most of the rest of the world calls the Spratlys in the South China Sea. The most recent satellite photographs suggest a different plan. The photos, collected and scrutinized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a   research organization, show the construction of what appear to be reinforced aircraft hangars at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, all part of the disputed territories. There were no military aircraft seen at the time the photos were taken. But a summary of the center’s analysis suggests that the hangars on all three islets have room for “any   in the People’s Liberation Army Air Force. ” A larger type of hangar on the islets can accommodate China’s   bomber and   refueling tanker, a   transport aircraft and a KJ200 Airborne Warning and Control System plane, the center said in its analysis. While China may assert that the structures are for civilian aircraft or other nonmilitary functions, the center says its satellite photos strongly suggest otherwise. Besides their size  —   the smallest hangars are 60 to 70 feet wide, more than enough to accommodate China’s largest fighter jets  —   all show signs of structural strengthening. “They are far thicker than you would build for any civilian purpose,” Gregory B. Poling, director of the center’s Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said on Monday in a telephone interview. “They’re reinforced to take a strike. ” The largest hangars, 200 feet wide, are “more than enough for strategic bombers and refuelers,” Mr. Poling said. If those planes were deployed, they would greatly complicate China’s disputes with the Philippines and other nations, and add a level of military risk to the United States’s “freedom of navigation” patrols through the area. Even before the hangars appeared, it was clear to independent military analysts that China’s intention was to use the islands to flex military might in the area. “We knew from the day they started building those runways,” Mr. Poling said. For China to assert a more benign purpose, he said, would be “like saying you’re building a mansion, but only living on the first floor. ” Evidence of the military hangars emerged a month after an international tribunal at The Hague sharply rebuked China over its behavior in the South China Sea, including its assertion of expansive sovereignty and construction of artificial islands. The tribunal’s ruling was a response to a landmark case brought by the Philippines, which called it an “overwhelming victory. ” Infuriated, China said it would ignore the ruling. Some analysts cautioned that the hangars were not a response to the ruling and had likely been under construction for some time. “The foundations may have been laid months ago,” said M. Taylor Fravel, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of its Security Studies Program. Mr. Fravel said the hangars are not necessarily inconsistent with the Chinese president’s assertions. “China has given itself the option to use these reefs as military facilities, but has not decided yet to what degree it is going to use them,” he said. “It creates the option for a robust defense of those places or even a power projection. ”",0
"Belgian prosecutors charge two over foiled attack on high-speed train BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian federal prosecutors said on Tuesday they charged two people over a foiled attack in 2015 on a high-speed train between Brussels and Paris. In August 2015 a machinegun-toting attacker wounded three people on a Thalys train before being overpowered by passengers, one of a series of militant attacks that has rocked Belgium and France over the past two years. The two men, named as Mohamed B. and Youssef S., were  indicted for participation in the activities of a terrorist group,  prosecutors said. They were among four people detained by police on Monday after houses were searched in Brussels and elsewhere in Belgium. The two others were released after interrogation. ",0
"Which States Can Gary Johnson and Jill Stein Spoil? Like his third-party forefathers, Gary Johnson gets irate when you call him a spoiler. “We’re giving people a chance to vote for something, as opposed to the lesser of two evils,” the Libertarian presidential nominee shouted last week at a Bloomberg Politics reporter who asked about his invisible path to victory.

In truth, there are only two reasonable outcomes for Johnson's long-shot campaign, neither of which ends with him in the White House. In one scenario, he is no more than a nuisance for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, an afterthought to either major party's march to victory. In the other, Johnson’s campaign alters the contours of the presidential race, drawing votes that would have otherwise gone to Trump or Clinton.

His own view notwithstanding, the Johnson-as-spoiler scenario is highly plausible this year. In both traditional battlegrounds and in states that would be safe terrain in a normal election year, third-party protest votes have the chance of flipping results—and electoral votes.

For months, the assumption has been that one-time Republican presidential candidate Johnson and his running mate, Bill Weld, both former Republican governors, might be an attractive option for members of Trump’s party resistant to their nominee, and that remains true. But this year’s spoiler threat is not just a one-party worry. Close to a month before Election Day, Clinton and her campaign are anxious that Johnson, along with Green Party nominee Jill Stein, may look just as desirable to disenchanted members of her Democratic coalition—particularly young voters—as they do to Republicans.

Johnson will be on the ballot in all 50 states this November; Stein will be on it in all but six. The name of an independent candidate, anti-Trump conservative Evan McMullin, will be seen in a dozen states, though others allow people to write it in. All three candidates fell short of the polling criteria that would have put them on the stage at the first presidential debate—and thus in living rooms of 84 million people. But that doesn’t change the number of voters who are unenthused about their major-party choices this November. No matter who wins next month, Clinton and Trump have already made history as the most disliked nominees ever.

Both have comparably high unfavorable ratings, nearing 60 percent, and that explains why Johnson has been able to maintain solid poll numbers deep into the fall. And the Clinton campaign has reason to be concerned. Nationwide, polls show that Johnson supporters are a mixed bunch who tend to skew younger and more suburban, with an equal representation from conservatives and liberals—a jumbled demographic profile that suggests the group may contain just as many Clinton doubters as Trump deserters. For this reason, Clinton’s highest-profile surrogates have hit the campaign trail with a new line of persuasion: urging disaffected lefties not to waste their ballot. Last week, President Barack Obama used a radio interview with Steve Harvey to brand third-party votes as a boon for Trump. The same day it aired, first lady Michelle Obama warned voters at a Clinton rally in Philadelphia that they will “help swing an entire precinct for Hillary’s opponent with a protest vote or by staying home out of frustration.”

For Clinton, potential supporters most susceptible to the third-party lure are those most weakly bonded to the party—those members of the Obama coalition without much of a record voting in non-Obama elections. Among the Trump cohort, third-party voters are more likely to be gleaned from base Republicans who reject their party’s unconventional standard-bearer.

Johnson has received endorsements from several conservative newspaper editorial boards, including the Detroit News, the New Hampshire Union Leader, and the Chicago Tribune, which dubbed this election a “moment to rebuke the Republican and Democratic parties.” USA Today, which normally abstains from presidential endorsements, chose to “disendorse” Trump, but refused to throw support behind Clinton, tacitly opening a door for Johnson.

Not all third-party pressures are equal in the Electoral College. Some states have long histories of strong independent leanings—among them are Alaska, Utah, and Johnson's home of state of New Mexico. Johnson is polling strongly in all three. And while Alaska and Utah are liable to stay their usual color, New Mexico, traditionally blue, is surprisingly close at this point, the result of Johnson siphoning votes from Clinton.

But the bigger questions are in swing states, and states on the cusp of becoming competitive battlegrounds. Third-party candidates essentially take votes out of circulation, lowering the win number. The spoiler problem arises when those votes come disproportionately from one side. Quantifying the Democrats’ nightmare scenario, in which support for Johnson and Stein grows to a significant enough level by, say, drawing a quarter of Clinton’s get-out-the-vote targets and an eighth of her base, Clinton could lose strongholds such as Washington and Pennsylvania. Places like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Nevada would become safely Republican.

If, conversely, the third parties garner enough votes mostly by flipping a quarter of Republicans' base and an eighth of their get-out-the-vote targets, it would flip the most competitive battlegrounds back to blue, while putting Montana, Arkansas, Indiana, and even Oklahoma within Clinton’s reach.

In 1992, Ross Perot scooped up nearly a third of the votes in Maine and Utah, pushing major-party candidates into third place, while getting closer to 19 percent of the nationwide popular vote. This year, there is no indication that even Johnson and Stein combined could reach that level of support, anywhere. Independent candidates typically see support drop as Election Day nears because many voters appear to come around and settle for one of the major party candidates. Still, the unpopularity of both Clinton and Trump has helped Johnson poll as high as 13 percent in states such as Colorado.

Johnson's strength means that a significant part of these last several weeks will be spent playing a three-sided persuasion game in which the goal is to scare wary voters into voting for the lesser of two evils rather than casting a protest vote. On a macro level, that's exactly why the Obamas and Bernie Sanders have all been out warning voters that a vote for a third-party candidate is a vote for Trump. But communicating with these disaffected voters on a more granular level is difficult, because there is little targeting information available to help strategists pick out potential protest votes buried among their base and mobilization targets. Even if campaigns could precisely identify these voters, it’s hard to know if they will turn to a third party or just stay home.

Below is an analysis of three states where third parties could make a big difference.

Democrats insist that they’re not worried about losing Colorado this November. Loyal Democrats make up three-fourths of the votes needed to win the state, and a recent influx of Hispanics and millennials has broadened Clinton’s get-out-the-vote options.

Trump’s low standing with Latino communities may alienate him from more than one-fifth of Colorado’s population. Additionally, his campaign message, which feeds on pessimism about the trajectory of American society, may be less potent to those living the Rocky Mountain lifestyle—Colorado's cities are often listed among the nation’s happiest places to live. Trump's appeals to economic insecurity are also probably better directed elsewhere, as unemployment in the state is under 4 percent, the lowest of any 2016 battleground state besides New Hampshire. Religious unease with Trump presents him yet another source of worry in Colorado: one-fifth of the Republican base lives in the Colorado Springs area, home to Focus on the Family and a hotbed for politically active Christians.

But that doesn’t make the third-party threat any less real. Libertarianism has always been most prevalent out West, and the growing number of young voters on Colorado's voter rolls—nearly a third of the state’s voters are under 35—represent a large chunk of the electorate with little historical loyalty to either party.

For any campaign, the key to a Colorado victory is its universe of persuadable voters, which is more than four times larger than in Nevada, the nearest battleground. Among these persuadable group, campaigns will find middle-aged and educated residents of the Denver area; they'll also find voters who are pro-marijuana and pro-choice. It’s with these groups that Johnson, who may benefit from name recognition from his time as governor of neighboring New Mexico, is polling best. A recent CNN/ORC survey of Colorado shows the Libertarian with 13 percent support statewide, most of it coming from self-identified independents.

As Johnson works to expand that support, his likeliest targets will be the nearly half of unreliable Democrats who are under the age of 35. Six out of 10 of the party’s get-out-the-vote targets are likely to have college degrees, and statistical models project 97 percent support among them for legal marijuana, which was enacted four years ago.

Clinton’s campaign will start worrying if third-party candidates start to attract more disenfranchised Democrats than irritated Republicans. If, say, third-party candidates were drawing a combined 16 percent of the total vote by siphoning off a quarter of Clinton's mobilization targets and one-eighth of her base, Colorado would flip, giving Trump an approximate four-point edge.

This year will be the first presidential election in which Colorado conducts its voting entirely by mail. Nearly two-thirds of the electorate is expected to cast ballots before Election Day, one of the highest rates in the nation, with six out of 10 persuadable voters likely to commit to a candidate before November. If Clinton is worried about dissension within her coalition, she may want to delay her GOTV tactics—the so-called ""chase"" programs that nudge voters to return their mail ballots—until she's had more time to sway them.

During a decade in which President Obama has significantly expanded the Democratic map into the South and West, Missouri is the largest one-time battleground state to have moved safely into the Republican column. Bill Clinton won there twice, but population decline in urban areas has kept Missouri out of Democratic reach since. Obama came within 3,600 votes of winning in 2008, but did not even compete for Missouri four years later, losing the state by 9 percentage points to Mitt Romney.

In a two-way race, Hillary Clinton would likely face a similar fate. Her Democratic base is roughly 60 percent the size of the one Missouri's Republicans count on. She could presumably turn out her entire mobilization list, while swinging every single persuadable voter her way, and still fall short.

With Clinton not actively competing in Missouri, Trump may have to worry less about losing the center to her than about Johnson's incursions on his right flank. Trump barely eked out a victory in Missouri’s March 15 primary, losing the state’s most educated and wealthy Republicans to Ted Cruz. The 380,000 Cruz voters—amounting to one-sixth of the general electorate—may represent Johnson's best chance to eat into the Republican coalition. Missouri evangelicals, whom Trump lost in the primary by 16 percentage points, make a promising (if unlikely) audience for the Libertarian, despite his party's traditional disdain for the politics of morality. Johnson might be able to package some of his small-government positions like a ban on federal spending for abortions to exploit existing doubts about Trump's commitment to religious priorities.

Recent polls have Trump up by a comfortable nine points, and Johnson in single digits. But if Johnson were able to pull at least a quarter from Trump’s GOP base and an eighth from his GOTV targets—pushing him to 14 percent of the vote overall—Missouri would become one of the nation’s tightest races.

Under normal circumstances, New Mexico would be a pipe dream for Trump. Democrats begin with a 145,000-voter head start over the Republican’ coalition in the state, and New Mexico's small number of persuadable voters leaves the Trump campaign with few options to outmaneuver Clinton’s ground-game forces. Third-party support could reach as high as almost a fifth of likely voters and Trump would still find the state difficult to win.

But an early October poll by the Albuquerque Journal found that Clinton’s 10-point lead in a head-to-head with Trump in New Mexico shrinks to a slight 4-point edge when third-party candidates are considered. The reason: Johnson, the former two-term Republican governor of the state, is hauling in a massive 24 percent of likely voters. That support is primarily made up of independent voters and appears to be evenly split among men and women, while also pulling equally from both Republican and Democratic coalitions.

Clinton could possibly head off a Johnson challenge by locking up support among the Hispanic voters that make up 45 percent of her get-out-the-vote targets. Trump, on the other hand, should probably worry most about losing votes to Johnson from within the majority of his base that is likely to have college degrees.

For New Mexico to slip from Clinton’s grasp, Johnson would have to win close to a quarter of voters and pull a majority of them from the Democratic ranks. To do that, he'd need to tap more than a quarter of Clinton’s less-reliable mobilization targets, as well as the equivalent of at least an eighth of her base voters, without dipping too much into Trump’s coalition.

"As Clinton moves to brink of nomination, Sanders eyes California upset While Hillary Clinton moved to the brink of clinching the Democratic presidential nomination with weekend wins in Caribbean contests – and could pass the milestone with a victory Tuesday evening in New Jersey – polls show Bernie Sanders still could deliver a symbolic wound by taking the Democratic stronghold of California.

Several recent polls have shown the Vermont senator closing Clinton’s lead in California and bringing the race into toss-up territory. The latest, from CBS News, showed Clinton up just 2 points over Sanders, 49-47 percent.

The same poll gave Clinton a comfortable double-digit lead in New Jersey, which is voting Tuesday alongside California and four other states in the last major primary day of the year.

Thanks to strong victories for the Democratic front-runner over the weekend in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, she is now in striking distance of the nomination -- 26 delegates short of the 2,383 needed to win, according to an Associated Press count. New Jersey could put her over the top Tuesday evening, before California even wraps up.

But an after-the-fact victory for Sanders in the Golden State would nevertheless be a blow to Clinton, who is trying to not only clinch the nomination but unify the party and nudge Sanders out of the race for good. A California win could energize Sanders and his supporters and encourage him to follow through on vows to take his fight all the way to the convention.

In a sign of what’s at stake, both candidates were barnstorming California ahead of Tuesday’s elections.

As the Puerto Rico race was called, Clinton was on stage in Sacramento, rallying voters in California.

Clinton captured at least 33 of the 60 delegates at stake in Puerto Rico. Sanders garnered at least 20, with seven outstanding. Clinton has 1,809 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses; Sanders has 1,520. When including superdelegates, her lead over Sanders is substantial -- 2,357 to 1,566.

The former New York senator and secretary of state is all but certain to secure the Democratic nomination Tuesday, when six states hold primaries in which a total of 694 delegates are available.

Like Clinton, Sanders made little mention of the outcome in Puerto Rico's primary. He said during an evening rally in San Diego that Democratic leaders should take notice that the ""energy and grassroots activism"" that will be crucial to the party in the fall ""is with us, not Hillary Clinton.""

He pointed to polls showing him faring better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups with Trump and his strength among Democratic voters under the age of 45.

""If the Democratic leadership wants a campaign that will not only retain the White House but regain the Senate and win governors' chairs all across this country, we are that campaign,"" he said.

While those watching the results in Puerto Rico focused on their impact on the race for the Democratic nomination, the focus of many voters on the island was its ongoing economic crisis.

Both Sanders and Clinton had pledged to help as the island's government tries to restructure $70 billion worth of public debt the governor has said is unpayable.

Two weeks before the primary, Sanders criticized a rescue deal negotiated by U.S. House leaders and the Obama administration as having colonial overtones. In a letter to fellow Senate Democrats, Sanders said the House bill to create a federal control board and allow some restructuring of the territory's $70 billion debt would make ""a terrible situation even worse.""

He later promised to introduce his own legislation to help the island. Campaigning on the island last month, Sanders promised to fight against ""vulture funds"" on Wall Street that he said would profit off the fiscal crisis.

""That bill is anti-democratic and it's not in the best interest of Puerto Rico,"" said Jorge Gaskins, a 67-year-old farmer who supports Sanders and opposes a control board.

Clinton has said she has serious concerns about the board's powers, but believes the legislation should move forward, or ""too many Puerto Ricans will continue to suffer.""

"Trump administration sends conflicting signals on Russia sanctions WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump grudgingly accepted new congressional sanctions on Russia, the top U.S. diplomat said on Tuesday, remarks in contrast with those of Vice President Mike Pence, who said the bill showed Trump and Congress speaking “with a unified voice.” The U.S. Congress voted last week by overwhelming margins  for sanctions to punish the Russian government over interference in the 2016 presidential election, annexation of Crimea and other perceived violations of international norms.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that he and Trump did not believe the new sanctions would “be helpful to our efforts” on diplomacy with Russia. Trump has been clear that he wants to improve relations with Russia, a desire that has been hamstrung by findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democrat Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. Tillerson, who did business in Russia when he was chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has said repeatedly that the world’s two major nuclear powers cannot have such a bad relationship. “The action by the Congress to put these sanctions in place and the way they did, neither the President nor I were very happy about that,” Tillerson said. “We were clear that we didn’t think it was going to be helpful to our efforts, but that’s the decision they made, they made it in a very overwhelming way. I think the president accepts that.” Tillerson stopped short of saying definitively that Trump would sign the sanctions, saying only that “all indications are he will sign that bill.” Vice President Mike Pence, at a press conference in Georgia with Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, said unequivocally that “President Trump will sign the Russia sanctions bill soon.” Pence acknowledged that the administration objected to earlier versions of the sanctions bill because it did not grant enough flexibility to the administration, but said it “improved significantly” in later versions. “And let me say that in signing the sanction, our President and our Congress are speaking with a unified voice,” Pence said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday the sanctions bill was under review and would be signed. “There’s nothing holding him back,” Sanders said at a news briefing. Trump has until Aug. 9 to sign the bill, or veto it, or it will automatically become law. In retaliation for the sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that the U.S. diplomatic mission in Russia must reduce its staff by 755 people. Russia is also seizing two properties near Moscow used by American diplomats. Tillerson said Putin probably believes his response was a symmetrical action to Washington seizing two Russian properties in the United States and expelling 35 diplomats last December. “Of course it makes our lives more difficult,” he said. Tillerson said he and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would meet in Manila on the margins of next weekend’s meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ",0
"Togo forces fire on protesters, seven wounded LOME (Reuters) - Security forces in Togo fired bullets and teargas on Thursday, wounding at least seven people as they sought to break up violent protests against the 50-year ruling family dynasty in the West African banking and transport hub. Activists have been demonstrating since August against President Faure Gnassingbe s refusal to give a clear date for stepping aside and to allow opposition parties to flourish in the region s only country that still does not accept presidential term limits. A Reuters cameraman saw trucks carrying armed paramilitary gendarmes drive into crowds and fire volleys of teargas. Protesters in the Lome suburb of Be, flanked by rundown buildings and palm trees, set up barricades, burned tyres and threw stones at the security forces.  We ve received seven people wounded by bullets so far,  said a doctor at the Social Medical Centre in Be, where some were being wrapped in bandages. The former French colony of 8 million people is home to several large firms, including Ecobank and regional airline ASKY, and has undergone major port upgrades as the president has sought to turn the resource-poor nation into a commercial hub. But a history of repression and the monopoly of power by one family - Faure took power in 2005 upon the death of his father Gnassingbe Eyadema, who had ruled for 38 years - threaten its stability.  Ghassingbe s opponents says reforms announced last month, in response to August s protests, will still allow him to run the West African country until 2030. ",0
"Man Sentenced to 12 Years in Beating Death of Transgender Woman - The New York Times A Brooklyn man who beat a transgender woman to death after he had started flirting with her was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Tuesday, a penalty the victim’s family said was too light. The man, James Dixon, 25, pleaded guilty to manslaughter this month in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, admitting he attacked the woman, Islan Nettles, on a street in Harlem just after midnight on Aug. 17, 2013, knocking her to the pavement with a punch, then hitting her again as she lay on the sidewalk. Ms. Nettles, 21, an assistant at a fashion company, died five days later of head injuries, prompting vigils and protests by transgender people who said her death was emblematic of the violence they often face because of their sexual identity. While Ms. Nettles was still in a coma, Mr. Dixon turned himself in to the police. In written and videotaped statements, he told detectives that he had started flirting with Ms. Nettles, unaware she was transgender, after meeting her and her two friends on the street. He said he became enraged and attacked her when his friends began mocking him for trying to pick up a transgender woman. “I just didn’t want to be fooled,” he said in a videotaped statement. The victim’s mother, Delores Nettles, told the court she believed 12 years was too light a sentence, given the brutal beating her daughter took. “He can go home after those 12 years and see his family,” she said in tears. “It’s not fair. ” Turning to Mr. Dixon, she said: “How can you sleep at night? How can you rest? I can’t rest. ” Mr. Dixon showed no emotion. He declined to make a statement before Justice Daniel P. Conviser pronounced the sentence, which had been negotiated with the judge on the eve of the trial in return for a guilty plea. Prosecutors objected to the deal they had sought a sentence of at least 17 years.",0
"The Fear of Being Gay in Russia Moscow’s first gay pride parade was held in May 2006, thirteen years after homosexuality was decriminalized in Russia. It was supposed to be a joyous occasion, the beginning of a new era of openness for the LGBT community.

It didn’t quite work out that way. LGBT marchers that day clashed with riot police, who tried to stop the event. “We disturbed something very deeply rooted in Russian society, some very evil power of intolerance and violence,” says Nikolai Baev, a prominent LGBT rights activist who attended the march.

Only a few months later, Russia saw its first regional anti-gay law passed in Ryazan, 200 miles east of Moscow. It was the first official sign that the Russian authorities would resist the LGBT movement—a resistance that has grown and become increasingly violent as LGBT activism has grown over the last decade.

That violence hit Dmitry Chizhevsky in November 2013 when he attended a weekly meeting for the LGBT community and friends called the Rainbow Tea Party in Saint Petersburg. “It was a place to socialize, drink some tea and play some games,” Chizhevsky says. It wasn’t a political event, and Chizhevsky wasn’t much for protests.

The old town had a hectic feeling that weekend as the 10 th Annual March Against Hatred took place in the city’s gracious main streets. The next day, on November 3, the tea party was more crowded than usual.

“I saw two guys next to the door wearing masks,” Chizhevsky recalls. “After that I heard shots. The first one hit my eye. They yelled, ‘Where will you run, faggot?’ and one hit me several times with a baseball bat. Then the attackers ran away. One of the small balls [from a pneumatic pistol] stayed behind my eye.” The police ran a rather lackluster investigation and no one was ever arrested.

He became an unsolved statistic—just one of a growing number in Russia’s LGBT community who’ve been attacked or harassed in what has become an unprecedented crackdown. In most of the West, gay rights has seen startling breakthroughs in the last decade. Russia has not just been left behind, but has become demonstrably worse and more dangerous, according to more than two dozen individuals we spoke with in five Russian cities over six weeks of reporting. On the local and national level, a series of so-called anti-gay propaganda laws were passed that made it illegal to discuss LGBT themes with minors or to distribute such information to them, even if it dealt with health issues.

In a country that increasingly punishes the “other” and where violence against select groups and individuals is often tolerated—and even encouraged—by the state, there’s become no greater target than being LGBT. A community that was just beginning to organize found itself under assault, the target of a deep-seated Russian homophobia that had now been embedded in law.

And for Chizhevsky, although he thought about staying in his native land, the price of being gay in Russia was ultimately just too high. Like more and more gays and lesbians over the last two years, Chizhevsky had had enough of Russia, a place where his sexual orientation alone seemed to make him an enemy of the state.

“Sometimes I don’t know how I feel about it,” Chizhevsky says about the trauma of that day. “I feel that I have gotten used to it over the past year. I am thinking more about the opportunities ahead and the future I want to build” in the United States. In July 2014, a little more than six months after the attack, Chizhevsky arrived in New York.

A self-educated software developer, Chizhevsky made his way to Washington, D.C., where he discovered an LGBT community that was out and open and living without fear. Chizhevsky decided to try to make a life here and to seek political asylum in the United States.

He was one of many Russian gays and lesbians to make that trek. U.S. asylum applications from Russians rose 15 percent overall in 2014, when there were 969 new cases. The U.S. government does not release the reasons people seek asylum, but asylum seekers like Chizhevsky say the spike is at least in part a result of the crackdown on the LGBT community.

“Everyone says that my case is not very difficult because it has been so well documented,” Chizhevsky says over coffee at Busboys and Poets on 14 th Street in Northwest D.C. “Even the United Nations asked Russia about my case”—a fairly typical part of the process since asylum seekers need to prove that they are in danger at home.

Despite the trauma, Chizhevsky is one of the lucky ones. LGBT activists interviewed in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kazan and Archangelsk say there is a pitched level of anxiety for those who stay behind. “All of a sudden, people started calling us Sodomites,” says Tatiana Vinnitchenko, 41, a lesbian activist with a group called “Rakurs” (Perspective). Rakurs is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that provided legal advice and community centers for the LGBT community in Arkhangelsk, which lies some 600 miles from Moscow and is the site of Russia’s first major seaport.

Vinnitchenko says she expects to be fired this  month from her job as a professor at Northern Arctic Federal University because of her activism. A Russian language instructor, Vinnitchenko says she’s been given an ultimatum: “I had to leave my job or stop my activities in Rakurs.” Leonid Shestakov, the acting rector at the university, says there have been “conversations of a personal nature held with Vinnitchenko,” but focused only on the performance of her duties.",0
"As Migrants Strain Border Towns, Pressure Builds on Mexico to Act - The New York Times TIJUANA, Mexico  —   Even before President Trump decided to build the wall, this Mexican border city was already overwhelmed. So many Haitian migrants, traveling across the Americas, began arriving here last year with hopes of crossing into the United States that churches, community halls,   programs, rehabilitation centers and private citizens have opened their doors to house, feed and clothe them. In one shelter, about 250 migrants  —   men, women and children  —   share two toilets and one shower. Four hundred are crammed into a church. A soup kitchen sleeps hundreds in hallways, a pantry and a lot out back. Now, some officials and advocates worry that Mr. Trump’s plan could spur immigration crises in towns and cities all along the border and, indeed, throughout Mexico. The Mexican government, they say, may not be able to handle it. Mr. Trump is seeking to tighten the border, restrict immigration and increase deportations from the United States. In announcing his actions this week, the president said they would “help Mexico by deterring illegal immigration. ” “Going to be very, very good for Mexico,” he declared. Yet some international officials and advocates envision a potential nightmare for the country. A growing number of people have been streaming north from Central America, fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands. Nearly 409, 000 were caught trying to cross the southwestern border of the United States illegally in the 2016 fiscal year, a 23 percent increase over the previous fiscal year, according to American government statistics. And the trend has continued over the past few months. As more migrants are blocked at the American border and more undocumented immigrants are deported from the United States, border communities in Mexico could be overwhelmed, migrant shelters could overflow, the ranks of the unemployed could swell, and Mexico will bear the strain, officials and advocates say. “It’s worrying us,” said Christopher Gascon, chief of the Mexico office for the International Organization for Migration. “How Mexico can handle that is going to be a whole new area of concern. I don’t think the absorptive capacity is there. ” Even before this week, Mexico was facing extraordinary migration pressures. The waves of Central Americans heading north were severely testing Mexico’s border patrol in the south of the country and led to a sharp increase in the number of people applying for asylum in Mexico, with applications more than doubling from 2015 to 2016. Mexican officials were also scrambling to develop a strategy in case Mr. Trump made good on his promises to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants, a population that includes millions of Mexicans. An intergovernmental group began on Monday to study ways to help integrate deportees into Mexican society. Beyond that, recent changes in American policy during the Obama administration had already contributed to the surge in Haitian migrants, as well as to a separate wave of Cuban migrants. Thousands of Cubans found themselves stranded in Mexico and Central America this month after the Obama administration ended a longstanding policy that favored Cubans. Under American pressure, President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico had been trying to stanch the flow of migrants heading through his country, starting the Southern Border Program in 2014 in an attempt to control the movement of people and goods crossing the border with Guatemala. The plan contributed to a doubling of deportations between 2013, before it was enacted, and 2016. Nearly all the deportees in recent years have been from Central America. But the country’s borders remain highly porous. The International Organization for Migration estimates that between 400, 000 and 500, 000 undocumented migrants transit through the country every year, about 90 percent of them Central Americans. Here in the state of Baja California, the migrant crisis has highlighted the Mexican government’s limited capacity to deal with the challenges. Haitian migrants, traveling from Brazil, began arriving in this border city last spring. For a while, the Haitians had little trouble crossing into the United States. In recognition of the troubles in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake there, American border officials allowed undocumented Haitians to enter under a humanitarian parole provision, with permission to stay for as long as three years. The migrants filled the handful of longstanding migrant shelters and cheap hotels in Tijuana while they waited, often for weeks, for their appointments with American border officials. Then in late September, the Obama administration suddenly announced that it was fully resuming the deportations of Haitians, hoping the policy change would dissuade more Haitians from migrating. Still, the Haitians kept coming. As the Haitian migrant population has ballooned  —   there are now about 4, 500 Haitians in Tijuana and elsewhere in northern Baja California  —   the Mexican authorities have resisted pleas to open a   emergency shelter. More than 30 shelters are providing for the Haitians, yet none are  . Most of the burden of sheltering, feeding, clothing and caring for the nonstop stream of Haitians has fallen to civil society groups and individuals, who have accused the government of doing too little too late. This month, a coalition of the main shelters in Tijuana and Mexicali sent a letter to Mr. Peña Nieto demanding a more robust federal “intervention” to address the crisis. The shelters have yet to receive a reply, they said. Advocacy and humanitarian groups in Tijuana filed a complaint this week with the National Human Rights Commission alleging that federal officials had violated the migrants’ human rights “in a widespread and repeated manner” by failing to address the crisis. Federal officials have rejected the criticism that they have been neglectful. “Is there room to do more? Yes,” Rodulfo Figueroa Pacheco, chief of the Baja California office of the federal migration agency, said in an interview last week, before the complaint was filed. “It’s been a struggle. ” “But,” he added, “it isn’t true that the governments have been unresponsive. ” The crisis, now in its ninth month, has been a crushing burden on the shelters. The migrant population at one longstanding shelter, Movimiento Juventud 2000, with capacity for about 25 people, soared to about 250, many of them living in donated tents in an adjoining lot that becomes a swale of mud when it rains. Iglesia Cristiana Embajadores de Jesus, a church situated in a denuded ravine on the western edge of Tijuana, was sheltering hundreds of people even though it was not connected to the municipal water supply and had to refill its tanks with a water truck. Administrators at Desayunador Salesiano Padre Chava, which had for years served as a soup kitchen, repurposed nearly the entire building, including corridors and the pantry, into a sprawling dormitory that at one point housed more than 500 people. Claudia Portela, coordinator of Padre Chava, which recently opened a smaller second shelter, estimates that donations have provided for 98 percent of their needs during the crisis. Government officials, while acknowledging that the bulk of the humanitarian assistance has come from civil society, insist that they have provided crucial services but have been sorely limited by budgets that were already under strain amid Mexico’s economic malaise. “Our deployment has been very, very small,” Mr. Figueroa said. “Institutional capacities are not as robust as we’d like. ” But despite the limitations, he said, government agencies had donated more than $280, 000, about 445, 000 meals, thousands of blankets, hundreds of mattresses and many other goods and services since late October. State and federal officials, he said, were still discussing the possibility of opening a shelter, but the proposal raised difficult practical and philosophical questions. “Will we be building something we can’t unbuild?” he said. Ad hoc networks of humanitarian groups have scrambled to help. “For me, the worst part is the omission of the federal government,” said Soraya Vazquez, one of nine women who run the Comité Estratégico de Ayuda Humanitaria Tijuana, a local group formed in September. “The government has to recognize it as a humanitarian crisis. ” On a recent morning, she and her colleague, Adriana Reyna, jumped into Ms. Reyna’s sport utility vehicle and took a tour of several shelters in Tijuana to assess their needs. At Iglesia Cristiana Embajadores de Jesus, the church in the ravine, a    Haitian girl had fallen. Her parents worried she had fractured a bone. So the women drove the child and her father to a nearby clinic where they arranged for a free evaluation, then swung by a pharmacy to pick up some medicine to treat the pain and swelling. At another shelter, the women lined up doctor’s appointments for a man with an infected leg wound and for two migrants who were experiencing complications with their pregnancies. They also strategized about setting up a piñata workshop that would give migrants employment. A message arrived, saying that an   cinema had about 30 pillows to donate. With a phone call, the women found a taker: a shelter in central Tijuana. At Iglesia Central del Nazareno, which had been converted into a shelter, the coordinator asked the women whether they had heard anything new about how Haitian migrants were being received at the United States border. Were they being deported? It was the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and rumors were flying. “I hope they’ll all be able to cross. I hope they’ll be O. K.,” said the coordinator, Ruth Gaxiola, fighting back tears. She looked exhausted. Ms. Vazquez opened her arms, and the women embraced.",0
"Bus plunges into river in Nepal, killing at least 31 KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A bus carrying passengers returning from a Hindu festival to the Nepali capital of Kathmandu skidded off the main highway and plunged into a river on Saturday, killing at least 31 people and leaving others trapped, officials said. The accident occurred around dawn, around 50 km (30 miles) west of the city on the Prithvi Highway that connects Kathmandu with the southern plains.  We have recovered 31 bodies and are looking for more,  government official Ram Mani Mishra told Reuters from the scene.  It s highly unlikely for anyone to survive for so long under water.  Rescuers on rubber boats and police divers managed to spot the bus hours after the crash and were trying to lift it from water with the help of a crane, Mishra said.     Apart from the deaths, 16 people have been injured, government administrator Shyam Prasad Bhandari said. Two with grave injuries were taken to Kathmandu while the rest were treated at a local hospital, he said. Police said survivors were thrown out of the bus windows but another 13 people were still believed to be trapped in the bus. The bus had left Rajbiraj town in the southeastern plains on Friday night. Road accidents are common in mostly mountainous Nepal, where police say about 1,800 people die in crashes every year. Accidents are also blamed on poorly maintained and crowded vehicles. ",0
"U.N. freedom of speech expert concerned about net neutrality GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. s freedom of speech expert said on Wednesday he was concerned about the ramifications of a decision in the United States to roll back net neutrality, since it could lead to small and independent voices being drowned out on the web. Last week the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal rules intended to ensure a free and open internet, setting up a court fight over a move that could recast the digital landscape. David Kaye, an American law professor and the U.N. Human Rights Council s independent expert on freedom of expression, said net neutrality, the idea that all internet traffic should be treated the same regardless of content, was essential.  Net neutrality is a really, really important principle from the perspective of ensuring broad access to information by all individuals,  Kaye told reporters in Geneva on the sidelines of the Internet Governance Forum.  I don t want to say that tomorrow there will be a huge amount of censorship, but over the long term, combine this with the concentration of media in the United States and in most places around the world, I think we should be worried about the ability of smaller voices that often (find it) harder to get traction in the market.       He said it would take years to know exactly what impact the U.S. move would have.  My concern in the U.S. space is that over time the companies will make decisions based more on their business model than on the content of information and the breadth of information that people should have access to,  he said.   That s a long-term problem and that s why I m very, very concerned about the rollback of net neutrality.  As companies blur the lines between providing the infrastructure and the content that makes up the internet, there is increasing risk of political pressure creeping in, Kaye said.   We used to think of telcos being very separate from content providers. But there s a lot of convergence now. So one of the risks is as content and infrastructure are merged more, the pressures on both, which might be of a political nature ... might restrict certain kinds of coverage.  ",0
"Turkey's Erdogan calls killing of Rohingya in Myanmar genocide ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that the death of hundreds of Rohingya in Myanmar over the past week constituted a genocide aimed at Muslim communities in the region. Nearly 400 people have died in fighting that has rocked Myanmar s northwest for a week, new official data showed, making it probably the deadliest bout of violence to engulf the country s Rohingya Muslim minority in decades.  There is a genocide there. They remain silent towards this... All those looking away from this genocide carried out under the veil of democracy are also part of this massacre,  Erdogan said at his ruling AK Party s Eid al-adha celebrations in Istanbul. The army says it is conducting clearance operations against  extremist terrorists  to protect civilians. Erdogan, with his roots in political Islam, has long strived to take a position of leadership among the world s Muslim community. He said it was Turkey s moral responsibility to take a stand against the events in Myanmar. Around 38,000 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar, United Nations sources said, a week after Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army base in Rakhine state, prompting clashes and a military counteroffensive. Erdogan said the issue would be discussed in detail when world leaders convene for the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 12 in New York. ",0
"Looming national security laws raise fresh fears for Hong Kong's freedoms HONG KONG (Reuters) - Amid calls from Hong Kong s pro-Beijing elite for sweeping new national security laws, government advisers and lawyers say the legislation is likely to be tougher than proposals shelved 14 years ago, raising fears about the city s cherished freedoms. Those demanding urgency for the long-delayed Article 23 are using a fledgling independence movement in the former British colony as justification   even though the independence debate would have been allowed when Article 23 was first proposed in 2003. Lawyers, diplomats and activists fear the new pressure could lead to legal  overkill  in an open city already struggling with increased interference from Beijing s Communist Party rulers.  We can see an intolerance from the central authorities over any kind of independence discussion,  said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school.  In this atmosphere, there is a concern that we could end up with something that criminalizes even the advocacy of independence, something that goes much further and is tougher than the previous proposals.   Kevin Yam, of Hong Kong s Progressive Lawyers Group, said it was vital to win the argument against independence by persuasion and debate, rather than a sweeping new law that curbs freedoms.  If the government goes too far, it will undoubtedly have a chilling impact on Hong Kong,  he said.  This is of great concern.  The government, in response to Reuters  questions, did not provide information on when or how it would kick-start legislation, but said it  will seek to create a favorable social environment for the community to handle this constitutional obligation ... in a positive manner.  Hong Kong, a free-wheeling global financial hub, has been ruled under a  one country, two systems  formula since Britain handed it back to China in 1997, guaranteeing freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression. Those freedoms are outlined in the Basic Law, a mini-constitution that also demands the city pass its own law covering treason, secession and subversion against Beijing. But many see Beijing increasingly involved in Hong Kong s affairs, such as the shadowy detention in 2015 of five Hong Kong booksellers who sold gossipy material critical of Beijing, and a legal interpretation from the Chinese parliament that eventually led to the disqualification of six democratically elected lawmakers. The calls to enact Article 23 follow that pattern, they say. Previous government proposals outlawed incitement to violence but sought to protect political debate. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets to protest against Article 23 in 2003, forcing the government to shelve it. Months-long pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 further heightened political sensitivities surrounding the legislation, and the government has not set a firm timetable to re-introduce it. But now pressure is mounting on Hong Kong to push through the laws after mainland officials expressed concerns in both public and private meetings. Senior Chinese parliamentarian Li Fei used a visit to Hong Kong last week to warn that Article 23 was a  duty that can t be shirked  while the chief of China s Liaison Office in the city also called for action.  Many risks and potential hazards that would affect or even threaten national sovereignty, security and developmental interests have not been effectively eliminated or prevented,  Liaison Office chief and Communist Party Central Committee member Wang Zhimin told pro-establishment lawmakers, according to his office s website. Chinese President Xi Jinping took what some saw as a harder line on Hong Kong s future during his visit in July to mark the 20th anniversary of the handover from the British. Challenges and threats to China s sovereignty and power, or the use of Hong Kong as a base for infiltration and sabotage, were acts that crossed  the red line  and were  absolutely impermissible , Xi said. Two members of Hong Kong s executive council - effectively the cabinet of leader Carrie Lam - have told Reuters that the 2003 bill would almost certainly have to be updated to reflect the fresh concerns. The city s independence movement, which has largely gone underground after most of its young leaders were charged for their roles in various protests, did not exist in 2003. Executive Council member Regina Ip - who pushed the previous bill as Hong Kong s then-security chief - said she could not say if the old proposals were sufficient in 2017.  We must review any proposed legislation against the evolving security situation... that is only natural,  she said. Her colleague and moderate democrat Ronny Tong said he believed, realistically, any new laws could draw the line at organized efforts to promote independence.  If the last version were to be passed, in fact it would not stop ... what is done by the students, because they are not advocating violence,  he said.  Hong Kong people are getting more and more intolerant of Beijing, and they (Chinese rulers) don t like that at all. Even short of independence, they feel that something needs to be done ... to try to make people more respectful to Beijing.    ",0
"Trump says North Korea's Kim insulted him by calling him 'old' HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had insulted him by calling him “old” and said he would never call Kim “short and fat.” Trump made the comment after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. In a series of tweets he also said Chinese President Xi Jinping was “upping sanctions” on North Korea in response to its nuclear and missile programs and that Xi wanted Pyongyang to “denuclearize.” During Trump’s visit to Beijing last week Xi reiterated that China would strive for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but offered no hint it would change tack on North Korea, with which it fought side by side in the 1950-53 Korean war against U.S.-led forces. One of Trump’s tweets read: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’ Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!” Speaking later in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi, Trump said “it would be very, very nice” if he and Kim became friends. “That might be a strange thing to happen but it’s a possibility,” he said. Trump has traded insults and threats with Kim in the past amid escalating tension over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs as North Korea races toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States -something Trump has vowed to prevent. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on Sept. 3, prompting another round of U.N. sanctions. In September Kim described Trump as a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” whom he would tame with fire. His comments came after Trump threatened in his maiden United Nations address to “totally destroy” the country of 26 million people if the United States were threatened. After North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho addressed the U.N. General Assembly in September Trump tweeted: “Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer!” North Korea has conducted dozens of ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. It has vowed to never give up its weapons programs, saying they are necessary to counter hostility from the United States and its allies. The United States has said that all options, including military, are on the table, although its preference is for a diplomatic solution. ",0
"Arab states blacklist Islamist groups, individuals in Qatar boycott DUBAI (Reuters) - The four Arab countries boycotting Qatar added 11 more individuals and two other entities, including a major group of Islamist scholars, to their  terrorist  blacklists for the Gulf state, Saudi state news agency SPA reported on Thursday. The lists now include the Qatar-based International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS) which was formed in 2004 mostly by clerics belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood and is chaired by the influential Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawi.  A statement issued by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain said they also blacklisted the International Islamic Council (IIC).   The two entities listed are two terrorist organizations that promote terrorism by using Islamic rhetoric as a cover to facilitate terrorist activities,  the statement said. The move deepened the rift between the four countries and Qatar, the world s top gas exporter and host to the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East. The countries cut ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of financing militants in Syria and allying with Iran, their regional foe. The Saudi-led quartet also added 11 individuals to their lists, including the acting Brotherhood leader Mahmoud Ezzat Ibrahim. The Muslim Brotherhood movement led the Arab Spring protests in 2011 that toppled some autocrats in the Middle East and North Africa. The Gulf States  rulers see the group, whose political ideology challenges the principle of dynastic rule, as a security threat. The IUMS membership includes the Saudi cleric Salman al-Awdah, who was arrested by Saudi authorities in September, the Tunisian Rached Ghannouchi, head of the Ennahda party, and Moroccan scholar Ahmed Raissouni. Mediation efforts of the Qatar crisis led by Kuwait and shuttle diplomacy by Western officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have failed to end what has become the worst rift between Gulf Arab states in years.

"The Art of the Deal: Why Putin needs one more than Trump  MOSCOW (Reuters) - In his book, ‘Art of the Deal,’ Donald Trump said the best deals were ones where both sides got something they wanted. His credo, applied to a potential U.S.-Russia deal, flags an awkward truth for Vladimir Putin: He wants more from Trump than vice versa.  As aides try to set up a first meeting between the two presidents, the mismatched nature of their respective wish lists gives Trump the edge, and means that a deal, if one is done, may be more limited and longer in the making than the Kremlin hopes.  “What the two countries can offer each another is strikingly different,” said Konstantin von Eggert, a commentator for TV Rain, a Moscow TV station sometimes critical of the Kremlin.  “The U.S. has a stronger hand. In biblical terms, the U.S. is the three kings bearing gold, while Russia is the shepherds with little apart from their good faith.”  Appetite for a deal in Moscow, where parliament applauded Trump’s election win, is palpable. The Kremlin blames Barack Obama for wrecking U.S.-Russia ties, which slid to a post-Cold War low on his watch, and with the economy struggling to emerge from two years of recession, craves a new start.  Trump's early moves spark alarm, resistance within the governmentCOMMENTARY: War College: Russia's hybrid war against the WestIran confirms new missile test, says it does not violate nuclear deal Trump’s intentions toward Moscow are harder to discern, but seem to be more about what he does not want — having Russia as a time-consuming geopolitical foe — than his so far vague desire to team up with the Kremlin to fight Islamic State.  Trump has hinted he may also push for a nuclear arms deal.  Putin’s wish list, by contrast, is detailed, long and the items on it, such as getting U.S. sanctions imposed over Moscow’s actions in Ukraine eased, are potentially significant for his own political future.  He is looking to be given a free hand in the post-Soviet space, which he regards as Russia’s back yard.  Specifically, he would like Trump to formally or tacitly recognize Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory, and pressure Kiev into implementing a deal over eastern Ukraine which many Ukrainians view as unpalatable.  The icing on the cake for him would be for Trump to back a Moscow-brokered Syrian peace deal allowing President Bashar al-Assad, a staunch Moscow ally, to stay in power for now, while crushing Islamic State and delivering regional autonomy.  For Putin, described in leaked U.S. diplomatic cables as an “alpha-dog,” the wider prize would be respect. In his eyes, a deal would confer legitimacy and show Russia was a great power.  But, like a couple where one side is more interested than the other, the expectational imbalance is starting to show.  Trump spoke by phone to five world leaders before talking to Putin on Jan. 28 as part of a bundle of calls. The White House readout of the Putin call was vague and four sentences long; the Kremlin’s was effusive and fifteen sentences long.  Nor does Trump seem to be in a rush to meet. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, said the two might only meet before a G20 summit due to take place in July.  Trump has good reason not to rush.  With U.S. intelligence agencies accusing Moscow of having sponsored computer hacking to help Trump win office, a deal would hand fresh political ammunition to Trump’s opponents, who say he has long been too complimentary to the Russian leader.  A delay would have the added advantage of postponing a chorus of disapproval from foreign allies and Congress, where there is bipartisan determination to block sanctions relief.  For Putin though, in his 17th year of dominating the Russian political landscape, a deal, or even an early symbolic concession such as easing minor sanctions, matters.  Expected to contest a presidential election next year that could extend his time in the Kremlin to 2024, he needs sanctions relief to help lift the economy out of recession.  U.S. and EU financial sector sanctions have cut Russia’s access to Western capital markets and know-how, scared off foreign investors, and — coupled with low global oil prices — have exacerbated an economic crisis that has cut real incomes and fueled inflation, making life harder for millions.  Since Putin’s 2012 election, consumer prices have risen by 50 percent, while a fall in the value of the rouble against the dollar after the annexation of Crimea means average salaries fell by 36 percent from 2012-2016 in dollar terms.  Official data puts inflation at 5.4 percent, but consumers say the real figure is much higher, and fear of inflation regularly ranks among Russians’ greatest worries in surveys.  An easing of U.S. sanctions could spur more foreign investment, helping create a feel-good factor.  “It would be a huge bonus if it happened,” said Chris Weafer, senior partner at economic and political consultancy Macro-Advisory Ltd, who said he thought Putin wanted to put rebuilding the economy at the heart of his next term.  The economy matters to Putin because, in the absence of any more land grabs like Crimea, greater prosperity is one of the few levers he has to get voters to come out and support him.  With state TV affording him blanket and favorable coverage and with the liberal opposition still weak, few doubt Putin would genuinely win another presidential term if, as expected, he decided to run.  But for the win to be politically durable and for Putin to be able to confidently contemplate serving out another full six-year term, he would need to win big on a respectable turnout.  That, an election showed last year, is not a given.  Around 4 million fewer Russians voted for the pro-Putin United Russia party in a September parliamentary vote compared to 2011, the last time a similar election was held.  Although the economic benefits of a Trump deal might take a while to trickle down to voters, its symbolism could boost turnout, helping Putin prolong a system based on himself.  “It would be presented to the Russian people as a huge victory by Putin,” said von Eggert. “It would be described as a validation of his strategy to go to war in Ukraine regardless of the consequences and to turn the country into Fortress Russia.”  ",0
"Papua New Guinea court rejects bid to restore services to asylum-seeker camp SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea s Supreme Court rejected an application on Tuesday to restore water, electricity and food supplies to an  Australian-run detention center for asylum seekers where nearly 600 men have been barricaded for a week. The men in the remote Manus Island facility have defied attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea to close the camp, refusing to move to three transit centers despite having little food or drinking water. Dozens of them also need medical help, three asylum seekers said, in a stand-off that the United Nations has described as a  looming humanitarian crisis .  The men have repeatedly said they would not move to the transit camps because they feared PNG residents on the island may attack, or that the will be resettled elsewhere in PNG or another developing nation. The court rejected the challenge on behalf of one of the detainees because it said power, water and food were available at the three transit centers, Ben Lomai, a lawyer for the detainee who lodged the application, told Reuters. Kate Schuetze, Pacific researcher for rights group Amnesty International, warned conditions could deteriorate  catastrophically .  The lives of these men, who are only asking for their rights to dignity and safety, are at serious risk,  Schuetze said in a statement. The men, who include asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Syria, were last given food on Oct. 29 and have been relying on sporadic aid from Manus island locals and rainwater. Several of the detainees told Reuters Papua New Guinea s navy had blocked access for islanders trying to deliver supplies in the past few days. Representatives for Papua New Guinea Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas did not respond immediately to a request for comment about the claim. Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran who has been detained on Manus island for more than four years, said 90 of the men were sick and required  urgent  medical treatment.  They have infection, stomach ache and diarrhea because of dirty water,  Boochani told Reuters. Despite the conditions, several of the men said they would continue to defy efforts to get them to leave, frustrating Australia s attempts to close one of two controversial detention centers it uses to detain asylum seekers who arrive by boat. The Manus island camp, and another on the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru, have been the cornerstones of Australia s controversial immigration policies, which has been strongly criticized by the United Nations and rights groups. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said before the court ruling on Tuesday the men were only refusing to move to the new transit centers on the encouragement of advocates.   There are alternative facilities available of a very high quality with food and all of the facilities,  Turnbull told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.  The relocation of the men is designed to give the United States time to complete vetting of candidates as part of a refugee swap deal that Australia hopes will see it no longer responsible for the detention of nearly 1,400 asylum seekers who have been classified as refugees. Turnbull negotiated the deal with former U.S. President Barack Obama last year. Under the deal, Australia will accept refugees from Central America.     ",0

"States file lawsuit challenging Trump decision on Dreamers NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fifteen states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Wednesday challenging President Donald Trump’s decision to end protections and benefits for young people who were brought into the United States illegally as children. The multistate lawsuit filed by a group of Democratic attorneys general on Wednesday to protect beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program argues their state economies will be hurt if residents lose their status. The lawsuit seeks to block Trump’s decision and maintain DACA. The lawsuit claims Trump’s decision was “motivated, at least in part, by a discriminatory motive” against Mexicans, who are the largest beneficiary of the program. It points to his statements from the 2016 presidential campaign.   The attorneys general also argue the government has not guaranteed DACA recipients that their application information will not be used “for purposes of immigration enforcement, including identifying, apprehending, detaining, or deporting non-citizens.” New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman took the lead filing the case in the Eastern District of New York. He said that 42,000 New Yorkers participate in DACA, and the end of the program will be “devastating” for them and would cause “huge economic harm” to the state.   In commenting on the suit, the U.S. Department of Justice noted that DACA was implemented under an executive order by former President Barack Obama, not through congressional action. “While the plaintiffs in today’s lawsuits may believe that an arbitrary circumvention of Congress is lawful, the Department of Justice looks forward to defending this Administration’s position,” spokesman Devin M. O’Malley said. Trump’s decision on Tuesday to end the five-year-old program instituted by former President Barack Obama plunged almost 800,000 young people, known as “Dreamers,” into uncertainty. The move drew criticism from business and religious leaders, mayors, governors, Democratic lawmakers, unions and civil liberties advocates.  Trump, who delayed the end of the program until March 5, shifted responsibility to a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans, saying it was now up to lawmakers to pass immigration legislation that could address the fate of those protected by DACA.   But the governor of Washington, whose state joined the lawsuit, criticized Trump for distancing himself from a final decision on the program.  Trump said Tuesday he still has “great heart” for the dreamers. “The president has tried to shirk responsibility for this, but let’s be clear, it is his hand on the knife in these people’s backs,” said Washington Governor Jay Inslee at a press conference announcing the suit. “He can’t just put it on Congress. It is his responsibility to fix this.” Other claims in the lawsuit are based on the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing the White House did not follow the correct process in changing the policy.  Legal experts have said that court challenges to Trump’s actions could face an uphill battle, since the president typically has wide authority when it comes to implementing immigration policy. ",0

"Merkel urges compromises as coalition talks enter final stretch BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday urged party leaders negotiating a tricky three-way coalition government to show more willingness to compromise, as support for her conservative bloc plunged to the lowest level in more than six years. Merkel s conservatives, who bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany in a Sept. 24 election, are trying to forge an alliance with the pro-market Free Democrats (FDP) and the left-leaning Greens which is untested at the national level. Despite three weeks of exploratory talks, the unlikely partners still have to overcome differences over climate protection, energy, transport, immigration and euro zone policy. Speaking ahead of a meeting in which party leaders were expected to sum up progress made so far and bridge some gaps, Merkel said all parties had first exchanged their views and then consolidated the approaches by highlighting their differences.  Now in this third phase, the task is to find compromises,  Merkel said, adding that there was still a lot of work to do.  But from my point of view, a solution can be reached with goodwill,  Merkel said.  If this will be achieved, we ll not know before the end of the week, however.  FDP leader Christian Lindner put the onus on Merkel s  Christian Democrats (CDU) and her Bavarian CSU allies, saying his party and the Greens had already given ground.  The Greens and the FDP have moved. Now it s up to the conservatives to show some flexibility. I assume there is goodwill from all sides,  Lindner said. Katrin Goering-Eckardt from the Greens said she wanted to see a leap from the other negotiation partners. But CSU leader Horst Seehofer declined to comment when asked by reporters what compromises he was willing to offer. The Greens made concessions on Tuesday by no longer insisting on fixed dates to ban cars with combustion engines and to shut down coal-fired power stations. The FDP gave ground by accepting more modest income tax cuts than an election campaign pledge of up to 40 billion euros in relief. Lindner also dropped an election manifesto pledge to phase out the ESM euro zone bailout fund. Merkel wants to have an agreement in principle by Nov. 16 on moving ahead to formal coalition negotiations to form a black-yellow-green government   dubbed a  Jamaica coalition  because the parties  colours match those of that country s flag. With less than a week to go, the exploratory coalition talks are not only complicated by the differences between the parties, but also by splits within the political parties themselves   especially within the conservatives and Greens. A breakdown of the talks could mean fresh elections in Germany,  Europe s biggest economy, since the Social Democrats (SPD)   the second biggest party   have made clear they have no appetite for joining another  grand coalition  under Merkel. A survey by Emnid for Bild am Sonntag newspaper showed only 30 percent would vote for Merkel s CDU/CSU bloc if there were a federal election this Sunday, down 1 percentage point. This is the lowest reading for the conservatives in this survey since October 2011 and marks a slump in support since the Sept. 24 election, in which Merkel s bloc won 32.9 percent. Touching on one of the thorniest issues, Merkel said on Saturday that Germany should lead the fight against climate change and cut emissions without destroying industrial jobs. Merkel s comments, made in her weekly podcast and in the middle of talks on limiting global warming attended by about 200 nations in the western German city of Bonn, highlighted the dilemma facing the centre-right leader in the negotiations. While the CDU/CSU and the FDP want to spare companies from additional burdens, the Greens want to spell out which measures the next government will implement for Germany to reach its 2020 goal of lowering emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels. Due to strong economic growth and higher-than-expected immigration, Germany is at risk of missing its emissions target without any additional measures.  ",0
"Gov. Jerry Brown Endorses Hillary Clinton Ahead of California Primary - The New York Times LOS ANGELES  —   Gov. Jerry Brown of California has run three times for president. He is serving his fourth term as governor and stands as one of the most popular elected officials in the state. He has also kept a noticeably low profile as the Democratic presidential primary contest has moved to California, reflecting what aides described as the interest he had in both candidates. But that ended on Tuesday as the Democratic governor came off the sideline and endorsed Hillary Clinton as someone who has the “tenacity and skill to advance the Democratic agenda” and defeat the presumptive Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump. “Democrats have shown  —   by millions of votes  —   that they want her as their nominee,” he said in an open letter to Democrats and to independents, who are permitted to vote in the Democratic primary on June 7. Mr. Brown’s decision is the latest sign that California is shaping up as a climactic end to the Democratic nominating session. Mrs. Clinton and her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have turned their attention to a state where Mrs. Clinton had once been confident of victory, and where one poll last week showed the two candidates essentially tied. On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders continued plowing through a heavy schedule of rallies in California, many in parts of the state where national candidates do not often go. Mrs. Clinton has scaled back plans to campaign in New Jersey to add additional events in the state, with a focus on Southern California, where she will be counting on minority voters to propel her. Nonetheless, she told MSNBC on Tuesday that she was “feeling very positive” about California. “We are competing everywhere, but I have been struck by some of the challenges California faces,” Mrs. Clinton said, criticizing Mr. Trump for denying the state’s drought. Mr. Sanders is spending about $1. 8 million on advertising in California, and Mrs. Clinton about $1 million, according to Kantar  . That is not a lot of money in a state like California, where a robust media campaign can easily cost $5 million to $10 million a week. Both candidates are concentrating their advertising campaigns, focusing on places like Fresno, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Mr. Sanders, after giving a speech on health care in Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, told reporters Tuesday that he was not surprised by Mr. Brown’s decision, noting that governors and other elected Democrats had repeatedly endorsed Mrs. Clinton, a former senator from New York and secretary of state. “I like Jerry Brown, but people can make their own choices,” Mr. Sanders said. “What we have had to do, and we have done pretty well in every state in this country, is taken on Democratic governors, taken on Democratic senators, taken on Democratic members of the House, Democratic mayors and all of their political apparatus. And yet we have won in 20 states, and I think we are going to win here in California. ” Mr. Brown, in his letter, offered strong praise for Mr. Sanders, noting the similarities between the Sanders campaign and the one Mr. Brown waged when he ran for president in 1992. “He has driven home the message that the top 1 percent has unfairly captured way too much of America’s wealth, leaving the majority of people far behind,” he wrote. “In 1992, I attempted a similar campaign. ” Still, the governor, who lost to Bill Clinton in a contest that left lingering bitterness between the two men, offered a powerful case against Mr. Trump in arguing that Mrs. Clinton had proved not only that she had abundant support among Democrats, but the ability to win in November. Mr. Brown met privately with Mrs. Clinton in San Francisco and Mr. Clinton in Sacramento last week. Mr. Trump, Mr. Brown noted in his letter, “has called climate change a ‘hoax’ and said he will tear up the Paris Climate Agreement. ” “He has promised to deport millions of immigrants and ominously suggested that other countries may need the nuclear bomb. He has also pledged to pack the Supreme Court with only those who please the extreme right,” Mr. Brown wrote. “The stakes couldn’t be higher,” he added. Even if she loses here, Mrs. Clinton will almost certainly have enough delegates to win the nomination. But a loss in the largest state  —   and in a Democratic stronghold  —   would not only provide a dark end to what has been at times an unhappy campaign, but might also empower Mr. Sanders to stay in the race, further delaying the point when Mrs. Clinton can turn her full attention to Mr. Trump. To win the nomination, Mr. Sanders would have to persuade hundreds of   superdelegates  —   party officials and leaders like Mr. Brown  —   to switch their allegiance in time for the July convention. Winning California, his aides say, can help him make that case. Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the senator would campaign heavily through Primary Day, going to parts of the state where he knows he can draw huge crowds and television coverage. “We think we have a very narrow path to get there,” Mr. Devine said of winning the nomination, “and California is the most important piece of that puzzle. ” A poll last week showed the two candidates essentially tied in the state. But many analysts say this is a difficult contest to poll, because there has been a huge   surge in registration and because it is challenging to project how many independents, who have favored Mr. Sanders, will actually participate.",0
"Donald Trump Ridicules ‘Cowardly’ Leaker James Comey President Donald Trump continued to cast doubt on the Senate testimony from his former FBI director James Comey, suggesting that his reliance on leaks to the media was longstanding. [“I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday.  He questioned whether Comey’s decision to leak details of his conversation with the president was illegal and cited the FBI director’s own testimony by calling him “very ‘cowardly. ’” During the testimony, Comey was asked by Sen. Dianne Feinstein why he told the president that “would see what we could do” when he asked the FBI director to help “lift the cloud” of the Russian investigation off of his administration. “Well, it was kind of a slightly cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we’re not going to do that  —   that I would see what we could do,” Comey replied. “It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly. ” Feinstein also asked Comey why he didn’t challenge the president defending his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, when he believed that Trump was urging him to drop the investigation. “Maybe if I were stronger, I would have,” Comey said. “I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took it in. ”",0
"District of Columbia approves $15/hour minimum wage WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The District of Columbia’s city council approved a $15-an-hour minimum wage on Tuesday, a rate adopted by a growing number of U.S. cities and states seeking to battle income inequality. The council voted unanimously to pass the measure boosting the minimum hourly wage to $15 by 2020, with subsequent hikes tied to inflation. A final vote will come later this month, and Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has backed the bill. Once approved, the U.S. capital will join California and New York in making $15 the hourly minimum. At least eight cities, including Seattle, have also approved the $15 base. “Raising the minimum wage will help address the issues of  residents being pushed out of the District due to rising costs of living and income inequality,” Council member Vincent Orange, a sponsor of the bill, said in the hearing. He and other supporters say Washington’s robust economy and growing population mean it can support a higher minimum wage.  The District of Columbia’s base wage is $10.50, and will go up by $1 on July 1 under existing law. The federal minimum is $7.25 an hour. The $15 minimum is estimated to raise wages for 114,000 workers, or about 14 percent of the District of Columbia’s workforce, according to an analysis for the council by the non-profit Economic Policy Institute. The higher pay proposal was supported by unions but was opposed by the District’s Chamber of Commerce. It said the District should not raise wages until neighboring suburbs do. The District of Columbia’s booming restaurant industry also opposed it. Restaurant owners and the local restaurant association said that higher costs would lead to layoffs. Some lawmakers said the measure did not go far enough to address a widening income gap and 18 percent poverty rate. Council member David Grosso added an amendment requiring the government to study a minimum income system to help the poorest residents. “Raising the minimum wage is a good thing, but is $15 enough? Or should the number be $35, or $50 an hour?” he asked. Under the measure, the minimum for workers who get tips, like waiters and bartenders, would also be $15 an hour by 2020. Following talks with unions, restaurateurs and community activists, employers would have to make up the difference between a base for tipped workers that will be $5 an hour in 2020, up from the current $2.77, Orange said.

"EU eyes more self-reliance after Trump victory BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union must take responsibility for dealing with neighbors Russia, Africa and the Middle East, its commissioner for “neighborhood policy” said on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. “Europe must shoulder its own share of international responsibility, especially in its neighborhood,” Johannes Hahn said on Twitter, although he also said: “America and Europe have always been strongest when they worked together.” During his campaign, Trump promised radical changes in U.S. policy, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and questioned the cost of U.S. military and other commitments in Europe. The EU faces a more aggressive Russia to the east, conflicts in the Middle East to the south and an increased threat from Islamist militants among others. The conservative leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said: “The message is clear: it is now up to Europe. We must be more self-confident and assume more responsibility. We do not know what to expect from the USA. “For the political culture in Europe, this is another wake-up call.” ",0
"U.S. Navy carrier drills with Japanese navy amid North Korean tension TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy carrier Ronald Reagan is conducting drills with Japanese warships in seas south of the Korean peninsula, Japan’s military said on Friday, in a show of naval power as Pyongyang threatens further nuclear and missile tests. The Reagan strike group will conduct a separate drill with the South Korean Navy in October, the defense ministry said in a statement distributed to South Korean lawmakers on Monday.  The 100,000-ton Reagan, which is based in Japan, and its escort ships have been holding drills with Japanese navy vessels since Sept 11 in waters south and west of Japan’s main islands, the Japan Maritime Self Defence Force said in a statement.  That exercise with the three Japanese warships, including two destroyers and one of the country’s two biggest helicopter carriers, the Ise, will run until Sept 28, it added.  The U.S. and regional allies are responding with military drills, including bomber and jet fighter flights near the Korean peninsula, as Pyongyang pursues its nuclear and missile programs, with an apparent hydrogen bomb test and two ballistic missile firings over Japan in recent weeks.  North Korea on Friday said it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to destroy the country. ",0
"May's Brexit deal wins her some peace at home - at least for now LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s Theresa May won a temporary reprieve from rival factions within her own party on Friday by striking a overnight agreement with the European Union that some business leaders hope will increase prospects of an orderly exit from the bloc. After all-night negotiations and an early morning dash to Brussels by May, she and EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to start talking about trade and a post Brexit transition period, declaring  sufficient progress  had been made on the cost and detailed terms of the separation. This took some of the heat out of a conflict between Conservative lawmakers that had threatened May s fragile grip on the party s leadership, and eased pressure on her minority government from business leaders who have repeatedly warned of a post-Brexit exodus.  Everyone s won a reprieve here,  said Anand Menon, director of The UK in a Changing Europe think tank.  This isn t a deal, it s a progress report ... It s exactly what she wanted - all she wanted was progress.  The Conservative Party s historical divisions over Britain s relationship with the EU had threatened to erupt earlier in the week when a carefully choreographed announcement of a deal spectacularly collapsed after the small Northern Irish party propping up her government objected to the terms. That raised the prospect of a fourth successive Conservative prime minister being forced from power over a row about Europe - a flashpoint that played a major part in the downfall of David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.  Pro-Brexit supporters said the only solution to the impasse over how to manage the Irish border after Brexit was to walk away from talks; pro-EU lawmakers said the deadlock could be better broken by agreeing to stay in the EU s customs union. In the end, they agreed that the details of the Irish border would be agreed as part of talks about the future relationship, according to a 15-page negotiators  report.  All we have done is put everything off until next year,  Menon said. But, influential voices from both sides of a party which still identifies along the  Leave  and  Remain  lines drawn during the June 2016 referendum, rallied round their leader, signaling a temporary truce. The agreement was endorsed by both Conservative Brexiteers and Remainers - both of which can count on enough supporters to undermine, and possibly even topple, May after her gamble on a June snap election backfired and stripped the party of a parliamentary majority.  This is a significant personal political achievement for the Prime Minister ... Earlier this week, there were all sorts of doomsayers who thought there would be no prospect of an agreement. They ve been proven wrong,  Michael Gove, an influential pro-Brexit member of her cabinet, told the BBC. In part, the closing of ranks around May reflects her party s concern that deposing her could trigger a fresh election in which a resurgent Labour Party, led by socialist Jeremy Corbyn, could win power. Former finance minister George Osborne, sacked by May in 2016, once described her pledge to run again as leader at the next election as something similar to seeing  the living dead in a second-rate horror film . On Thursday he predicted she would lose her leadership before the end of the current term, due to run until 2022.  Businesses also warmed to the declaration of progress, which was rubber-stamped over breakfast in Brussels after a night of back and forth phonecalls between May, her Northern Irish backers the Democratic Unionist Party, and EU officials.   Businesses will be breathing a sigh of relief,  said Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce.  The endorsements came with hefty caveats, warning that more clarity needed to come quickly to prevent businesses from triggering contingency plans to cope with a so-called  hard Brexit  in which Britain would leave without a negotiated settlement  The sand in the timer is running out - leave it too late and damage will be done to both the UK and the EU,  said Miles Celic CEO of the TheCityUK trade body which represents London s financial services sector.   For the financial and related professional services industry, our critical issues must now be progressed.  Equally, the calm among Brexiteers within May s party was not matched by those outside it, with one of the main campaign groups that persuaded Britons to vote 52 to 48 percent in favor of leaving saying she had not met their definition of Brexit. Much of their anger was directed at a backstop option set out in the text of the agreement which promised that if trade talks failed, the United Kingdom would maintain  full alignment  with those rules of the EU internal market and customs union that help protect north-south cooperation in Ireland.  Under Theresa May, we are leaving the European Union in name only,  said Leave campaigner Arron Banks in a statement.  If anyone in the Conservative Party has any integrity or sense of duty left, we call on them now to save Brexit by triggering a leadership contest.  Nevertheless, Friday s agreement was seen as a big step toward avoiding a chaotic exit and formalizing terms which would meet many pro-EU observers  definition of a  soft exit .  It means that  no deal  overall is less likely,  said Charles Grant, Director of the Centre for European Reform think tank. But the toughest part of the negotiations could be yet to come, with Britain looking to agree a huge free trade deal before March 2019 -  a tight timetable seen as unrealistic by Brussels.  In phase two it will emerge that the EU is going to give us a pretty bad deal in terms of what s in our economic interests,  Grant said.    Asked if Friday s agreement was a step toward a softer Brexit, May s spokesman said:  They re not terms that we ve ever recognized or engaged with. There is the Brexit, which the British people voted for, and that s what we re delivering.  ",0
"Turkey urges Iraqi Kurds to drop referendum, cites sanctions ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey appealed to northern Iraq s Kurdish region on Friday to drop plans for an independence referendum, saying it would threaten security and force Ankara to slap sanctions on a neighbor and trading partner. Turkish government spokesman Bekir Bozdag told a news conference that  all options were on the table  regarding its response to the referendum, although he stopped short of giving details on what sanctions could entail.  It is not possible for us to accept the postponing of the referendum either. We demand a total cancellation, so that we won t have to impose sanctions,  Bozdag told reporters. Bozdag s comments followed back-to-back meetings of Turkey s cabinet and National Security Council, both of which were chaired by President Tayyip Erdogan. The president has also said parliament will convene on Saturday to discuss the response to the referendum. Earlier, the council called on the president of the northern Iraqi Kurdish region, Massoud Barzani, to stop the referendum. The council said Turkey retained the rights defined in bilateral and international agreements if the vote were held. It did not elaborate on the nature of those rights.  Turkey, home to the largest Kurdish population in the region and fighting a Kurdish insurgency, has warned that any breakup of neighboring Iraq or Syria could lead to a global conflict. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the referendum was a matter of national security for the country and Ankara would never accept a change of status in Iraq or Syria.  An action that will change the status in Syria and Iraq is an unacceptable result for Turkey, and we will do what is necessary,  Yildirim said. Erdogan has threatened to impose sanctions against Kurdish northern Iraq.  On Monday, the Turkish army launched a highly visible military drill near the Habur border crossing, which military sources said was due to last until Sept. 26, a day after the planned referendum. Turkey has for years been northern Iraq s main link to the outside world. It has built strong trade ties with the semi-autonomous region, which exports hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil per day through Turkey to international markets. ",0
"Trump ordered to give deposition in Washington restaurant suit WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Washington judge has ordered Republican President-elect Donald Trump to give a deposition in a lawsuit against celebrity chef Jose Andres stemming from Trump’s disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants. District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Jennifer Di Toro ruled on Wednesday that Trump must testify in New York about Andres’ restaurant deal at Trump’s luxury Washington hotel. The deposition can last up to seven hours and will take place in the first week of January. His lawyers had sought to limit how long Trump could be questioned and what could be covered, contending he was extremely busy ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration. But Di Toro said in her order that limits on the deposition could harm preparations by Andres’ lawyers, and that Trump’s own statements were at the heart of the case. Trump is suing Andres for $10 million over breach of contract after Andres backed out of a plan to open a restaurant in the Trump International Hotel a few blocks from the White House. Andres, who was born in Spain and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, has said he canceled the project after Trump denounced Mexican immigrants in June 2015 as drug dealers and rapists. Andres has argued that the comments made it difficult to attract Hispanic staff and customers and to raise money for a Spanish restaurant. Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Chef Geoffrey Zakarian also pulled out of a restaurant deal at the hotel, citing Trump’s remarks. Trump has sued Zakarian for breach of contract and was deposed in that case in June. Andres suggested in a tweet on Tuesday that the two sides wrap up the lawsuit and donate money to a veterans’ group instead. “Why keep litigating? Let’s both of us win,” he said. The hotel has drawn fire from critics who say it poses a potential conflict of interest since Trump is leasing the site, a historic former post office, from the federal government. ",0
"FACTBOX: About 6.1 million without power in U.S. Southeast after Irma: utilities (Reuters) - Power outages from Hurricane Irma dropped to about 6.1 million in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama by Tuesday afternoon, down from a peak over 7.4 million late Monday, according to local utilities. Most remaining outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state. FPL, a unit of NextEra Energy Inc and the state s biggest power company, said its outages dipped below 2.8 million by Tuesday afternoon from a peak of over 3.6 million Monday morning. FPL said it expects to restore essentially all of its customers in the eastern portion of Florida by the weekend and the harder-hit western portion of the state by Sept. 22. The company, however, warned it would take longer to restore customers with tornado damage or severe flooding. Florida outages for Duke Energy Corp, which serves the northern and central parts of the state, fell to around 1 million by Tuesday afternoon, down from a peak of about 1.2 million on Monday, according to the company s website. Irma hit southwestern Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second-highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It gradually weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression on Monday. In Georgia, utilities reported over 1.1 million customers without power Tuesday, down from a peak of around 1.3 million on Monday night. Other big power utilities in Florida are units of Emera Inc and Southern Co, which also operates the biggest electric companies in Georgia and Alabama.

"Trump administration outlines how it will wind down 'Dreamer' program WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration outlined on Tuesday how it will dismantle a program that shielded from deportation undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and allowed them to work in the country. The winding-down of the program was announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said that Congress would have six months to decide on an alternative. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke issued a memo that rescinded a 2012 DHS memo that established the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The DHS will provide a limited window for some DACA recipients whose work permits expire before March 5, 2018 to apply to renew those permits. Such individuals must apply for renewal before Oct. 5, administration officials said in a briefing call with reporters. Former DACA recipients whose work permits expire will be considered to be in the United States without permission and are eligible for removal, but they will be a low priority for immigration enforcement, the officials said.

"Graham’s 2020 Tax Law for POTUS Candidates Unconstitutional Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) is proposing a federal law that would require all candidates for president to release their 1040 personal income tax returns, including President Donald Trump. But such a law should not survive a court challenge, because it would be unconstitutional. [Article II of the Constitution sets forth three criteria to be eligible for president. A person must be (1) a natural born citizen, (2) at least 35 years of age, and (3) been residing in the United States for at least 14 years before the election.  That is all. Everything else is left to the voters to decide whom they want as commander in chief. Consequently, a federal statute requiring submitting tax returns would impose a requirement beyond what the Constitution specifies. Any candidate running for the presidency in 2020 would have legal standing to challenge the statute’s legality in court. Several Supreme Court cases involving Congress buttress the idea that Graham’s idea would not pass constitutional muster. In Powell v. McCormick (1969) the Court held that the Constitution’s provision that a simple majority of the U. S. House (or Senate) can decide the qualifications of its new members before allowing them to be sworn into Congress is limited to the criteria set forth in the Constitution (citizenship, age, and residency). Excluding a duly elected candidate for any other reason amounts to expelling that person from Congress, which requires a   vote by Congress, instead of 51 percent. More recently, in U. S. Term Limits v. Thornton (1995) the justices split on whether states can impose term limits on people from that state in Congress (there, six years for House members and 12 years for senators) voting   that such limits imposed by states are unconstitutional. Justice Thomas dissented, joined by the conservative justices plus one moderate justice, arguing that under the Tenth Amendment each state has sovereign authority to add its own conditions for people from that state. The Supreme Court is currently divided on whether state lawmakers can impose additional requirements to qualify for various federal offices on each state’s ballot, but there is likely no disagreement regarding requirements imposed by federal lawmakers to qualify for the ballot. Both the majority and the dissent in Term Limits seemed to indicate that Congress could not impose additional requirements beyond the Constitution’s. The only other constitutional provision relevant to this discussion gives Graham no support. The Elections Clause in Article I says that while states have primary jurisdiction over elections, Congress can pass laws altering the “times, places and manner” of elections for federal office. That Article I provision does not include Graham’s proposed law. This has nothing to do with an election’s time (such as having federal elections on a Tuesday in November) place (polling locations) or manner (such as allowing   requirements to cast a ballot). This would instead add a requirement on who can be listed on the ballot. This has nothing to do with transparency or making information available to the public. This is instead about who gets to decide such matters. In this case, the Constitution sets forth what conditions must be satisfied to run for president. The voters can impose whatever additional requirements they choose as shown by who they vote for, but that is between the candidate and the electorate, not legislators who seek to insert themselves into the voting process in ways not authorized by the Supreme Law of the Land.

"In First, Trump Condemns Rise in Anti-Semitism, Calling It ‘Horrible’ - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   President Trump said on Tuesday that the rise of   in the United States since his inauguration was “horrible” and “painful,” reacting publicly for the first time to mounting threats targeting Jewish people and institutions after he drew criticism for being slow to condemn them. During a visit to the National Museum of   History and Culture, Mr. Trump said he was reminded of the need to combat hatred “in all of its very ugly forms. ” He spoke one day after 11 bomb threats were phoned in to Jewish community centers around the country and a Jewish cemetery in University City, Mo. was vandalized. “The   threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible, and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” Mr. Trump said. The statement came after weeks of private complaints from leaders of major Jewish organizations to members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, including his    Jared Kushner, about the president’s seeming unwillingness to speak out forcefully against   acts. His failure to do so stoked concern among some Jewish leaders that Mr. Trump, whose presidential campaign drew the support of racist and   groups including the Ku Klux Klan, was at best willing to stay silent about such actions and at worst quietly condoning them. Mr. Trump’s comment on Tuesday was a rare concession to the demands of outside forces by a president who prides himself on standing his ground. Despite the questions that arose during his campaign, Mr. Trump has never proactively delivered a statement condemning  . “The president’s sudden acknowledgment of   is a   on the cancer of   that has infected his own administration,” said Steven Goldstein, the executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect. “When President Trump responds to   proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that’s when we’ll be able to say this president has turned a corner. ” He added, “This is not that moment. ” The White House was criticized by Jewish groups last month when it issued a statement honoring International Holocaust Remembrance Day that did not mention the six million Jews who perished, instead broadly mentioning “the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror” and “those who died. ” Pressed on the matter, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, defended the statement as “inclusive” of all of those targeted during the Holocaust, including Gypsies, priests and gay people, and he called the criticism “pathetic. ” Concern mounted among Jewish leaders after a news conference last week at which Mr. Trump reacted angrily to a question about his response to the increasing number of   acts around the nation. The president called the query insulting and demanded that the questioner, who works for a Jewish publication, sit down. The   League called the president’s reaction “ . ” Mr. Trump, who was criticized during his campaign for being slow or halfhearted in condemning hate speech, has been particularly stung by accusations that he is   or that he has nurtured the rise of such sentiments. Such accusations have been leveled against both the president and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, a former chairman of Breitbart News, a website that has cultivated a white nationalist following. The president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who converted to Judaism to marry Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew, wrote in a Twitter post on Monday: “America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship  religious centers. #JCC. ” JCC is the abbreviation for Jewish community centers. Morton A. Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America and a strong supporter of Mr. Trump, said, “One of the issues here is that President Trump and Steve Bannon are very upset and very frustrated that so many Jewish organizational leaders have accused them of being   which is very unfair and simply inaccurate. ” Mr. Klein added, though, that “President Trump needed to, himself  —   not through a statement by his daughter that didn’t even mention    —   speak up against this kind of hatred and urge law enforcement to do all they can to find these perpetrators and hold them accountable. ” The president’s slow response, he argued, may have been in part because Mr. Trump “wants to make these decisions on his own and not feel like he’s being told what to do. ” The proliferation of   acts in the United States and the president’s failure to address them publicly were frequent topics of conversation in Jerusalem over the weekend, where the leaders of American Jewish groups gathered for meetings, according to attendees who described the private discussions on the condition of anonymity. On Tuesday, several organizations issued statements praising Mr. Trump’s comments. “We appreciate that President Trump spoke directly to this matter,” said Nathan J. Diament, the executive director for public policy at the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. “The words of a president of the United States carry great weight, and it is important that Mr. Trump addressed the American Jewish community and all our fellow Americans at this time. ” Still, some leaders said they wished Mr. Trump had made a personal call for his administration to find and prosecute perpetrators of the recent   threats. The Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Mr. Trump to present a plan for combating   and called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to form a task force on the matter. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks   activities, said the wave of threats was “really worrying,” especially because of the “tendency on the part of this administration to completely overlook terrorism and political violence from the domestic radical right. ” Mr. Potok also welcomed Mr. Trump’s comments, but he criticized them as tardy. “It’s very nice that President Trump opposes these crimes,” Mr. Potok said. “It might have been helpful if he had done so months or even years earlier. ” Mr. Spicer complained on Tuesday that Mr. Trump was being treated unfairly. “It’s ironic that, no matter how many times he talks about this, that it’s never good enough,” he said at a briefing with reporters. He declined to respond to a shouted question about whether Mr. Trump would ask the Justice Department to prosecute those responsible for the   acts. Mr. Trump has mentioned his Jewish grandchildren and daughter when questioned about his commitment to combating  . Yet defenses of Judaism that do not involve fealty to Israel have proved tougher for a man raised in New York, a city heavily populated with Jews. In an interview with Jake Tapper of CNN at the end of February 2016, soon after Mr. Trump won the South Carolina primary, Mr. Trump demurred when pressed repeatedly about the support offered to him by David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader. “Honestly, I don’t know David Duke,” Mr. Trump said at the time. Asked by reporters days later why he would not simply disavow Mr. Duke, Mr. Trump shrugged and said, “I disavow, O. K.?”",0
"Brazil's largest ever corruption probe nearing its end, judge says SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian federal Judge S rgio Moro on Monday said the Car Wash probe, Brazil s largest ever corruption investigation, is nearing completion in the southern city of Curitiba, where it started in 2014.   There are still investigations under way, but a large part of the work has been done,  Moro told reporters in Sao Paulo after a ceremony where he received a distinction from U.S.-based Notre Dame University for his work leading the probe. Brazil s largest corruption probe started almost by accident in Curitiba, when investigators went to a local Car Wash to ask owners why the small company had done several international money transfers. From there it spread to several state-controlled companies, politicians, parties and private engineering groups. But Curitiba remained the host city for almost the whole investigation.     Moro said he is a bit tired due to the workload resulting from the spreading probe, but he ruled out leaving the operation until it is concluded. He also dismissed suggestions that he could run in next year s election, despite the huge popularity he gained among Brazilians. Some pollsters such as Datafolha have included Moro s name in some early surveys.  They are losing their time, because this is not going to happen. Simple as that , he said, adding that he is a professional federal judge and will remain so. Despite the prospect of work related to the Car Wash investigation to end in Curitiba, Moro said they it will go on in other cities who host higher court instances and also in Brasilia, where several parts of the probe are being conducted by the Supreme Court.

"Amy Adams on Eyes That Deceive - The New York Times Amy Adams has received five Oscar nominations and this year is poised to land her sixth, for her performance in Denis Villeneuve’s “Arrival,” a stirring   drama about a linguist and mother tasked with communicating with aliens. She also stars as an unhappy Hollywood gallerist in Tom Ford’s “Nocturnal Animals. ” Ms. Adams sat down with the Bagger for a brief chat on, of all days, Nov. 9. Ms. Adams steered clear of politics  —   “it’s a time for reflection,” is all she would say  —   but confessed to having slept little the night before. She spoke about what she describes as “the blank nature of my face” and the unexpected joy of not preparing to get naked onscreen in front of Mr. Ford. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. At the beginning of your career you were known for more joyful roles, but in these two movies, these are somber and even, in the case of “Nocturnal Animals,” tortured women. Do you feel like there’s a natural evolution to that? Definitely. It takes you to a more reflective place, as you get older. Before I was just sort of working to find a niche, and now it feels like I’m taking roles with more intention. I feel more in control of my instrument, so I feel like, ‘Yeah, let’s do that, let’s try different things. ” Let’s take, and I say [here she made air quotes] risks, because at the end of the day I’m only risking humiliation. I’m not really risking my life or anything. Yet you’re very vulnerable you can see it in your eyes. You’re known for that, this sort of naked thing. The thing is, my eyes photograph on camera really big. I don’t know if it’s the color, the shape. The sort of blank nature of my face. I have one of those faces, without makeup, it’s literally a gesso canvas. On my flight, the steward came up and said, “I kept thinking I knew you from somewhere!” He only recognized me after he heard my voice. That must be nice, being able to slip by unnoticed in everyday life. I love it, I get to be a mama. I get to navigate the world for the most part. You said you initially felt not  much of a connection with the role, until you had a conversation with Denis about what the core of the story was about. Can you talk about that? I think I was more concerned [with] how it would play in the final film. I knew that it was going to be   and that it was written as a very intimate portrayal of a mother telling a very complicated, scientific, nuanced story to her daughter, about the decisions she made. It just felt commercially risky. But Denis was onboard. And I could tell from the way he spoke that he had this emotional, he had an intellectualism. That’s probably not the word. For someone who plays a linguist it takes me a long time to find the right word. Emotional intelligence? There it is. That’s what I’m looking for. This is what today has done to me. [Denis] has an emotional intelligence that I trusted when I met him. He looks you in the eyes. I trust that.  “Nocturnal Animals” came after that and you wore these gorgeous   clothes. Were you able to eat at all? I did get to, which was nice, especially for the scenes when I was younger, because I wanted my face to look younger [by looking more rounded]. You know films shoot out of order. One night, they said, “Can we shoot the shower and bathtub scene?” And I was like, “You gotta give me time. I’m still on solids!” I say that as a joke. But it made me more    because I hadn’t spent all this time thinking about what I needed to look like. You’ve been nominated for Oscars five times  —   is it stressful going through the whole process again and again? It’s easy to get caught up, not in the nominations  —   not in the   aspect of it, but just in everything that it becomes. The red carpets and the overimportance. It’s easy for that to sort of take center stage in that moment, especially when you’re a young woman. For me, it definitely at times is overwhelming, that whole process. But I’m always grateful because the nomination for “Junebug” and campaigning launched what is my current career. So I can’t   the process.",0
"Brazil judge suspends aspects of J&F leniency, asset sales in limbo BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge on Monday suspended criminal aspects of the leniency agreement of J&F Investimentos SA, a holding company run by the scandal-ridden Batista family, adding to uncertainty about billions of dollars of asset sales. Federal Judge Vallisney de Souza Oliveira held up the criminal immunity of additional J&F executives until the Supreme Court makes a final ruling on Joesley Batista s plea bargain in a corruption probe, whose benefits were revoked due to evidence he had hidden some crimes from prosecutors. Police flew Batista to Brasilia on Monday following his surrender to authorities in Sao Paulo over the weekend after he lost immunity from prosecution. Police also raided J&F s headquarters and Batista s home on orders from Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin. Uncertainty about J&F s leniency agreement could threaten an estimated 14 billion reais ($4.5 billion) of recent asset sales  and jeopardize the future of a company that diversified from meatpacking into fashion, energy, wood pulp and banking over the past five years. J&F lawyers said Joesley Batista  did not lie or omit information  in his plea deals. A lawyer for Batista did not take calls seeking comment. JBS SA (JBSS3.SA), the world s largest meatpacker and the crown jewel of the Batistas  empire, also signed terms last week to participate in the J&F leniency agreement. On Monday, JBS agreed to sell its British poultry unit Moy Park to U.S. subsidiary Pilgrim s Pride Corp (PPC.O) for $1 billion. Civil aspects of the J&F s leniency agreement, which was signed in June and ratified by Judge Oliveira on Friday, remain in effect, according to a statement late on Monday from federal prosecutors. J&F reached a deal with prosecutors earlier this year agreeing to pay a record fine of 10.3 billion reais for its role in a corruption scandal involving the bribery of hundreds of politicians. That settlement was based on a plea bargain signed by Joesley Batista and collaborators in May to deliver evidence including a recording of his conversation with President Michel Temer, which led to a corruption charge against the leader. But additional evidence later handed to prosecutors included another tape that appeared to show that Batista had been helped by federal prosecutor Marcelo Miller in crafting the plea deal and concealing certain crimes, according to prosecutors. Police also raided Miller s Rio de Janeiro home on Monday. His lawyers said he cooperated with the search and with investigators. The scandal was the latest shock to Brazil s business and political establishment after three years of investigation into widespread political bribery and kickbacks on contracts with state-run companies. The recording of President Temer provided to prosecutors by Batista allegedly revealed him endorsing hush payments to a possible witness in the graft probe. Temer has repeatedly denied the accusations and the lower house of Congress voted against him standing trial at the Supreme Court.  ($1 = 3.10 reais) ",0
"DELINGPOLE: Revealed - The Real Reason Trump Pulled Out Of Paris...   …    Is because he has a very powerful bullshit detector. We know this thanks to a fascinating and unwittingly revelatory article in the German newspaper Der Spiegel.[    The paper reveals how, in the days running up to President Trump’s decision to quit the UN Paris accord, he received a series of deputations from EU leaders urging him to change his mind. “For me it’s easier to stay in than step out,” Trump told them. This is perfectly true. Since his momentous Rose Garden speech announcing his plans to pull out of Paris, Trump has taken more flak than a   raid over Berlin in ’44. He has upset his daughter Ivanka, his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, his financial advisor Gary Cohn. On top of that, he has given the entire liberal half of the planet, plus sundry conservative squishes, the perfect excuse they needed to dismiss him as a   loon in thrall to Big Oil, Big Coal, Big Evil, etc  …     If Trump pulls the US out of the #ParisAgreement he will be committing a traitorous act of war against the American people. My statement: pic. twitter.   —   Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) May 29, 2017,  USA to Earth: FUCK YOU,  —   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) June 1, 2017,  Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.  —   Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017,  So what was it that tipped Trump over the edge? Well sure, as he made clear in his brilliant White House speech, it was about American jobs. But while I’ve no doubt that that fact provided the rational basis for his bold, principled decision, I think we can look elsewhere for the tipping point. And here it is, in black and white, in Der Spiegel‘s account of how the G7 leaders tried to badger Trump at the summit in Taormina, Sicily. Leaders of the world’s seven most powerful economies were gathered around the table and the issues under discussion were the global economy and sustainable development. The newly elected French president, Emmanuel Macron, went first. It makes sense that the Frenchman would defend the international treaty that bears the name of France’s capital: The Paris Agreement. “Climate change is real and it affects the poorest countries,” Macron said. Then, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reminded the U. S. president how successful the fight against the ozone hole had been and how it had been possible to convince industry leaders to reduce emissions of the harmful gas. Finally, it was Merkel’s turn. Renewable energies, said the chancellor, present significant economic opportunities. “If the world’s largest economic power were to pull out, the field would be left to the Chinese,” she warned. Xi Jinping is clever, she added, and would take advantage of the vacuum it created. Even the Saudis were preparing for the   era, she continued, and saving energy is also a worthwhile goal for the economy for many other reasons, not just because of climate change. At which point, Trump’s bullshit detector must have been bleeping off the scale. Let’s examine those arguments, one by one. First, Mummy’s Boy Macron’s line that “Climate change is real and it affects the poorest countries. ” The first half is trivially true: climate has indeed been changing for the 4. 5 billion years of the planet’s existence. But the notion that recent climate change is catastrophic, unprecedented and significantly   is a shaky theory, not a proven fact. And in any case it is beside the point. Even supposing that climate change is all those things, it doesn’t alter the fact that Paris is a pointless waste of money, especially for countries like the U. S. which are expected to bear the burden of the cost. As Bjorn Lomborg has calculated, using the alarmists’ own models and data, if every signatory nation sticks to Paris then the effect will be to reduce global warming by 0. 17 degrees C by 2100. At a cost in excess of $100 trillion. As for the “affects the poorest countries” part  —   even if this is true, there are better ways of helping poor countries than bombing the U. S. economy to the dark ages. Like, promoting a flourishing economy which yields more to spend on foreign aid. Next, Canadian Prime Minister Bieber on the Ozone Layer. As Matt Ridley shows in some detail here, the vanishing ‘ozone layer’ is more or less an urban myth trotted out by environmentalists mainly to justify their insatiable advocacy of     . For reasons I will explain, this news deserves to be taken with a large pinch of salt. You do not have to dig far to find evidence that the ozone hole was never nearly as dangerous as some people said, that it is not necessarily healing yet and that it might not have been caused mainly by CFCs anyway. The timing of the announcement was plainly political: it came on the 25th anniversary of the treaty, and just before a big United Nations climate conference in New York, the aim of which is to push for a climate treaty modelled on the ozone one. See how these memes get repeated, over and over again, as memes are? That piece was from 2014. You can lay money that it won’t be the last time some environmentalist or politician brings it up to “prove” that concerted intergovernmental legislation works because it “healed the ozone layer. ” Finally, the Mutti of all Globalists herself, Mrs Merkel. “Renewable energies, said the chancellor, present significant economic opportunities. ” Yes, I suppose they do, if like Elon Musk you’ve got your snout buried deep in the subsidies trough, or like Warren Buffett you like to profit off the tax credits  or like wind and solar developers everywhere you just don’t care about the bats and birds sliced and diced, the countryside spoiled and the people who have their sleep disturbed and their property values trashed. But strip away the subsidies and the green lies and renewables make no economic or environmental sense at all. As for the green Chinese. The green Chinese are laughing at us. As, by the way, are the Indians. And here’s why  …     Now do you see what I mean? President Trump pulled out of Paris for a lot of sensible reasons. But the one that tipped him over the edge was quite simply this: when you’ve got your fellow leaders of the free world insulting you with arguments you know to be bullshit and treating you like you’re some kind of an idiot, well suddenly it all becomes crystal clear what you’ve gotta do  …     You call those charlatans’ bluff and remember why it was that people voted you to be President of the U. S. A: because they wanted someone real doing the job, for a change, and not yet another of those charlatans  …    ",0
"Exclusive: From Russia with fuel - North Korean ships may be undermining sanctions MOSCOW (Reuters) - At least eight North Korean ships that left Russia with a cargo of fuel this year headed for their homeland despite declaring other destinations, a ploy that U.S. officials say is often used to undermine sanctions. Reuters has no evidence of wrongdoing by the vessels, whose movements were recorded in Reuters ship-tracking data. Changing a ship s destination once underway is not forbidden and it is unclear whether any of the ships unloaded fuel in North Korea.  But U.S. officials say that changing destination mid-voyage is a hallmark of North Korean state tactics to circumvent the international trade sanctions imposed over Pyongyang s nuclear weapons program. Changing course and the complex chain of different firms  many offshore   involved in shipments can complicate efforts to check how much fuel is supplied to North Korea and monitor compliance with a cap on fuel imports under U.N. sanctions.    As part of North Korea s efforts to acquire revenue, the regime uses shipping networks to import and export goods,  U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Marshall S. Billingslea told the congressional Foreign Affairs Committee this month.  North Korea employs deceptive practices to conceal the true origins of these goods. Pyongyang has been found to routinely falsify a vessel s identity and documentation.   The eight vessels identified in the tracking data set sail from the Far Eastern Russian port of Vladivostok or nearby Nakhodka and registered China or South Korea as their destination with the Information System for State Port Control. After leaving Russia, they were next recorded off the North Korean ports of Kimchaek, Chongjin, Hungnam or Najin. None went on to China and most went back to Russia.   All had a cargo of diesel, a source at the company that services vessels in Vladivostok said. Their cargo capacity ranged from 500 tonnes to 2,000 tonnes.  One of the vessels was the Ma Du San, owned by North Korea s Korea Kyongun Shipping Co. It took on a cargo of 545 tonnes of marine fuel at Vladivostok s Pervaya Rechka terminal, owned by Russia s Independent Petroleum company (IPC).  Reuters obtained a bill of lading   a receipt for goods issued when a ship loads up   dated May 19 showing the Ma Du San s cargo came from Khabarovskiy NPZ, a refinery owned by IPC. The ship set sail on May 20. Documents filed with Russia s Information System for State Port Control stated its next destination as the Chinese port of Zhanjiang and the bill of lading showed it as Busan in South Korea. The Ma Du San s next recorded location after Vladivostok was inside the perimeter of the port of Kimchaek   all the other ships were tracked only in the vicinity of ports. North Korean ships intermittently turn off their transponders, and satellites cannot track them at such times, U.S. officials say. Allegations outlined in two U.S. Treasury Department sanctions orders and a legal complaint filed by the U.S. government match the information Reuters obtained on the Ma Du San though the U.S. documents do not name the vessel involved.  On June 1, the U.S. Treasury Department included IPC on its sanctions blacklist, saying it provided oil to North Korea and may have been involved in circumventing sanctions. On Aug. 22, the U.S. government sanctioned two more companies, both registered in Singapore   Transatlantic Partners and Velmur Management Pte. Ltd. The legal complaint, also filed on Aug. 22, accused the two firms of money laundering on behalf of sanctioned North Korean banks seeking to buy petroleum products, citing a bill of lading for May 19 for a cargo of diesel sold by IPC to Velmur and loaded in Vladivostok   the same date as the bill of lading for the Ma Du San. Andrey Serbin, who represents Transatlantic Partners, said the firm had not received payments from a sanctions-hit bank and that ownership of the fuel changed after it was loaded.  We sold the fuel to a Chinese company,  Serbin, who has been blacklisted by the U.S. government for  operating in the energy industry in the North Korean economy  and working to purchase fuel for delivery to North Korea, said of several shipments where the company acted as middleman.   There s no way we can control them (the goods),  he said. Serbin did not identify the vessels Transatlantic Partners loaded fuel on to, but a source in a company that services ships in Vladivostok said the Ma Du San was among them.  The bill of lading named the recipient of the Ma Du San s cargo as a company called LLC Sky Shipping Limited. Reuters was unable to find any record of such a firm. Velmur said it could not have known where the cargo would end up and did not knowingly help anyone dodge sanctions.  IPC did not respond to a request for comment. Its parent company, Bermuda-registered Alliance Oil Company Ltd., denied having any contractual relations with North Korean companies when U.S. sanctions were imposed on IPC. The U.S. Treasury and State departments declined to answer questions about Reuters  findings. Russia s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about fuel exports to North Korea but has said Russia complies with the sanctions. Russia s customs service said it could not provide information about movement of goods across borders. Since the U.S. sanctions were imposed on IPC, all North Korean-flagged vessels that had been in Vladivostok port have left, according to the tracking data.  They departed with no cargo, an employee with a shipping agent in Vladivostok said. This is confirmed by documents seen by Reuters. Russian supplies of oil and oil products to North Korea are much smaller than volumes shipped by China, Pyongyang s only major ally. Beijing has acted to reduce the flows, but Russia s trade in all goods with North Korea more than doubled in the first quarter of 2017 to $31.4 million. Moscow s trade with Pyongyang is under closer scrutiny following a series of missile launches by North Korea and a test involving what it said was a hydrogen bomb.

"UK government still undecided on final Brexit aims: Hammond LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s government has not yet decided what it wants from a final Brexit deal because it is still waiting to clear preliminary talks with Brussels, finance minister Philip Hammond said on Wednesday. With the clock ticking towards Britain s scheduled March 2019 exit from the European union, the government is focused at the moment on getting a green light for the negotiations on future trade relations with the EU, Hammond said.  The cabinet has had general discussions about our Brexit negotiations but we haven t had a specific mandating of an end-state position,  he told lawmakers in Britain s parliament. Prime Minister Theresa May s top ministers have big differences over what Brexit should mean for Britain, and over the extent of concessions that the country should offer in return for preferential access to the EU s single market. Hammond said a group of key government ministers would deal with the issue once Britain is given the go-ahead by other EU countries that it can proceed with negotiations for a new, post-Brexit trade deal. That go-ahead is on hold pending an agreement by the bloc s other 27 member states that Britain has done enough on the terms of its divorce, now stuck on differences over how open the future border between Ireland and Northern Ireland should be.  We are not yet at that stage and it would have been premature to  have that discussion until we reach that stage,  Hammond told parliament s Treasury Committee. A spokesman for May, asked about Hammond s comments, told reporters that government ministers would discuss the preferred outcome of the Brexit talks before the end of the year.  We re not into phase two (of negotiations) yet, and Brussels have been clear that they re not prepared to discuss  end state ,  the spokesman said. Earlier on Wednesday Brexit minister David Davis inflamed critics of the government s handling of Brexit when he said he had not conducted formal sector-by-sector analyses of the effect of Brexit on the economy, arguing they were not yet necessary. Hammond has previously said he favors striking a  pragmatic  deal with the EU to minimize Brexit s impact on businesses and the economy, angering some Brexit supporters who favor a more definitive rupture with Brussels. On Wednesday, Hammond reiterated that Britain would leave the EU s single market and its customs union but that need not represent a big change to Britain s relationship with the bloc, if Britain replicates most of the current arrangements.  Now, that would have consequences and some of our colleagues would not find that palatable, but it would be logically possible to approach it in that way,  he said. May hopes to secure the launch of the second phase of the Brexit negotiations when she meets other EU leaders next week. But she suffered a setback this week when her allies in a political party from Northern Ireland objected to proposals for post-Brexit rules for the border with Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party said on Wednesday the stand-off increased the likelihood of a  no deal  Brexit - the nightmare scenario for many British businesses. ",0
"Trump's march stirs growing sense of dread among U.S. Republicans WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans in Washington are coming to grips with what many of them not long ago considered an unimaginable reality: Donald Trump is likely to be their presidential nominee and standard-bearer. The prospect of Trump winning the Republican primary had been the stuff of Washington jokes, whispered hallway conversations and eye-rolls, even as he led in public opinion polls for months and dominated debate after debate. But with the brash billionaire now winning three straight contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, denial is giving way to a mostly gloomy acceptance that he may have too much momentum to be stopped, especially if wins big in key Southern primaries next week that look favorable to him. “It fills all of us with concern and dread,” said Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has endorsed fellow Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, considered the main hope of the Republican establishment to derail Trump’s march to the nomination. That march was given a boost on Friday when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race after a dismal finish in New Hampshire, became the first major establishment Republican to endorse Trump. “There is no better fighter than Donald Trump,” Christie said at a news conference with Trump in Texas. Trump has vowed to scrap U.S. trade deals, slap a tariff on imported goods and raise taxes on hedge-fund managers, as well as retain some sort of mandate to purchase health insurance - clashing with the free-market principles that have long underpinned Republican economic policy.  Some Republicans in Congress, such as Flake and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said a Trump nomination would do enormous damage to the party and predicted a heavy election defeat in November to the eventual Democratic nominee. “I am like on the team that bought a ticket on the Titanic after we saw the movie,” said Graham, contending that Trump would be “slaughtered” in the general election.  In a Republican presidential debate in Houston on Thursday night, another Trump rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, challenged him on his electability, citing ties to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton such as a donation to the Clinton Foundation. Trump responded by ridiculing Cruz for his inability to win more than the early voting state of Iowa and taunted him for being behind the billionaire in opinion polls in Cruz’s home state of Texas. Said Trump, “If I can’t beat her, you’re really gonna get killed, aren’t you?” Another Rubio supporter, Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, told Reuters he would not back Trump if he were the nominee. “If the nominee is a fraud, and someone who’s offensive, and incapable of being an effective president like Donald Trump, I won’t support him,” Curbelo said.  Other Republicans tried to be more optimistic.  “I don’t think his nomination would be catastrophic,” said Senator Susan Collins of Maine. She said she did not believe, as some strategists fear, that having Trump on the ballot in November would hurt Republican chances for holding onto control of the Senate, where the party currently has a 54-46 edge. Conservative economist Arthur Laffer, an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan who has been counseling Trump on tax policy, said he was convinced the real estate mogul was open to sound advice. Laffer recalled Trump telling him: “‘Look, if you’ve got a better idea than I’ve got, tell me, and I’ll change.’” Senator John Thune of South Dakota suggested Trump’s presence could help by bringing more voters to the polls.  “There’s a lot of energy, a lot of intensity on our side,”  Thune said.  Privately, lobbyists, economists, and analysts expressed deep concern about having Trump, who has proposed building a wall along the southern U.S. border and imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, as the face of the party.  “There are a lot of people who are really freaked out,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was the chief economic policy advisor to 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain. “He seems to be winging it.”  Conservative policy-makers worry that Trump’s pitch to voters is based on his management skills rather than conservative principles.  Juleanna Glover, a prominent Republican communications consultant, told Reuters that Trump’s ascent “spells the death of the party’s sentient and cohesive governing framework.” Two Republican business lobbyists, who also asked to remain unidentified, told Reuters that they are very concerned about Trump, chiefly because they do not know what he stands for.  They said they have no sense of certainty because Trump’s positions on issues such as tax, trade, and regulation range from being only vaguely understood to completely unknown.  By vowing to make America “win” again abroad while going into little detail on his foreign policy plans, Trump is also stirring concern in Washington national security circles.  A high-ranking official at a conservative think-tank, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his job requires him to steer clear of partisan politics, said: “Every serious student of American strategy is sick to their stomach about the possibility of Trump being the Republican nominee.”  Robert Kagan, a conservative foreign relations expert at the Brookings Institution think tank, said in a column for the Washington Post on Thursday that he would vote for Clinton rather than Trump. “The party cannot be saved, but the country still can be,” he wrote. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a leading voice on conservative economic policy, was asked Thursday whether he could work with someone like Trump if he became the nominee.  “We’ll cross these bridges when we get to it,” Ryan said. “But I do believe that we will be able to unify as a party.” Asked about the hand-wringing in the Republican establishment about Trump, his campaign manger, Corey Lewandowski, said, “Look, we’ve got relationships with those guys and we talk to them all the time.  “But I think what you find is that, you know, politics as usual in Washington, D.C., is not something that the American people want,” he said. Lewandowski added that voters “sent a very clear message” in the three early voting states where Trump won nominating contests “that they want someone who is going to make fundamental change.” Asked if Trump’s campaign would work harder to win establishment endorsements as he got closer to the nomination, Lewandowski pointed to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, an early establishment favorite who quit the race on Saturday. “If endorsements mattered,” he said, “Jeb Bush would be the nominee.”  (Reporting by Susan Cornwell, Richard Cowan, Kevin Drawbaugh, Jason Lange, Arshad Mohammed, David Morgan, James Oliphant,  Matt Spetalnick and Emily Stephenson; Writing by James Oliphant; Editing by Stuart Grudgings and Frances Kerry) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"Outgoing U.S. envoy says U.N. needs to 'push' Iran on arms embargo UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council needs to push Iran to abide by an arms embargo, outgoing U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said on Wednesday amid U.N. concerns that Tehran has supplied weapons and missiles to Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah. Most U.N. sanctions were lifted a year ago under a deal Iran made with Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia, the United States and the European Union to curb its nuclear program. But Iran is still subject to an arms embargo and other restrictions, which are not technically part of the nuclear agreement. In her last appearance at a public Security Council meeting before U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration steps aside on Friday, Power said that recognizing “progress on Iran’s nuclear issues should not distract this council from Iran’s other actions that continue to destabilize the Middle East.”Under a Security Council resolution enshrining the 2015 deal, the U.N. secretary-general is required to report every six months on any violations of sanctions still in place. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman briefed the 15-member council on the second U.N. report and said there had been no reports of nuclear-related or ballistic missile-related violations of the council resolution. However, the report expressed concern that Iran may have violated the resolution by supplying arms to Hezbollah. Iran’s senior nuclear negotiator said in 2015 that Tehran had no intention of complying with the arms embargo or ballistic missile restrictions. “We on the council need to come together to push Iran to effectively implement the binding provisions of resolution 2231 - especially restrictions that ban Iran’s export of arms and related material,” said Power. She did not specify how. The council could impose further sanctions over breaches of the arms embargo, but Russia and China - which are council veto powers along with the United States, France and Britain - were unlikely to agree to such a move, diplomats said. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap the nuclear agreement or seek a better deal. Trump’s nominee to replace Power, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, said it would be better to review the deal rather than withdraw from it. She also told lawmakers at her Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday that Iran should be held accountable for sanctions violations. She said: “Anytime that we put sanctions forward we should follow through on those when there are violations.” ",0

"Russian Official Apologizes for Doping Problem but Says Athletes Shouldn’t Be Barred - The New York Times Russia, facing deepening scrutiny over accusations that it orchestrated a doping campaign during the Sochi Olympics in 2014, on Sunday made a public plea for its track and field athletes to be allowed to compete in this summer’s Games in Rio de Janeiro. Writing in The Sunday Times, a British newspaper, the Russian sports minister said Russian officials, coaches and athletes made “serious mistakes,” but he stopped short of specifying them or admitting to any state role. “We are very sorry that athletes who tried to deceive us, and the world, were not caught sooner,” wrote the sports minister, Vitaly Mutko. “We are very sorry because Russia is committed to upholding the highest standards in sport and is opposed to anything that threatens the Olympic values. ” But he added: “It cannot be right that clean athletes should suffer for the behavior of others. In no other walk of life would this happen. ” The accusations of an elaborate drug operation at the 2014 Winter Olympics, published last week in The New York Times, have led to growing calls to bar Russia and its powerhouse track and field team from the Rio Games, which are set to open in August. Craig Reedie, the president of the World   Agency, told the BBC on Saturday that it was “highly unlikely” that Russia’s antidoping agency would be declared compliant with world sports rules in time for the Games. Russia was provisionally suspended from international track and field competition by the International Association of Athletics Federations in November after WADA issued a   report that outlined a pervasive culture of doping among the country’s sports programs. The I. A. A. F. is expected to decide next month whether the country has done enough to fix the problems and have its eligibility reinstated. In the New York Times report, Grigory Rodchenkov, a former director of Russia’s antidoping laboratory, detailed how a doping program that involved dozens of athletes unfolded at the Sochi Games. Dr. Rodchenkov said state antidoping experts and members of the intelligence service covertly replaced tainted urine samples with clean ones collected from the athletes months earlier, before they started doping. Russia has reacted to the accusations with statements both deploring the use of   drugs by its athletes and vigorously rejecting contentions that it was involved. On Thursday, the Russian sports ministry acknowledged in a statement that doping problems existed among its athletes while expressing “shock” over Dr. Rodchenkov’s disclosures. Speaking to reporters the next day, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin said, “All this simply looks like slander by a turncoat. ” The deputy sports minister, Yuri Nagornykh, said Russia and the athletes named in the Times article were considering whether to file a defamation lawsuit. On Sunday, Mr. Mutko struck a much more conciliatory tone. He said Russian officials were doing all they could to stamp out doping by the country’s athletes. He also said that aspiring Olympians would be subjected to additional tests and that two “international experts” were now based in Moscow to supervise the country’s antidoping agency. “We have done everything that has been asked of us by the I. A. A. F. in order to be reinstated,” Mr. Mutko wrote in The Sunday Times. However, he added, the scourge of doping extends worldwide. To single out Russia would be unfair, he said. “The Olympic Games should be a cause of unity,” he said. “Barring Russia’s athletes from competing in Rio would risk tearing this unity apart. ” Peter Donnelly, the director of the Centre for Sport Policy Studies at the University of Toronto, said on Sunday that Mr. Mutko had touched on a legitimate problem with how doping violations are handled by sports governing bodies. The International Olympic Committee and world sport federations need to find ways to target punishments at those who are complicit in an athlete’s doping, Dr. Donnelly said, adding, “It’s difficult for me to see how punishing all pending Russian Olympic track and field athletes can be considered as justice. ”",0
"Kellogg to Cut 250 from American Workforce - Breitbart As a long list of companies announce new initiatives to add jobs and enlarge investment in the U. S. economy in the coming age of Trump, Kellogg Co. is announcing that it intends to cut another 250 jobs in America. [The famed breakfast cereal company has confirmed recent reports that it intends to scale back its workforce, according to USA Today.  The move is intended to make the company more efficient and is to be “focused on eliminating work that doesn’t drive the highest returns. ” Kellogg was still trading on Wednesday near its   low, closing at $71. 98, which was five cents below its Tuesday closing. “The majority of the impacted employees work at our headquarters in Battle Creek, and changes are taking place across most functions in the organization,” the company told the media. “As you would expect from Kellogg, we’ll help our impacted people through these transitions, including offering severance benefits and outplacement services. ” Kellogg has manufacturing plants across the country as well as in 17 other countries. But the company’s profits have been slipping for several years, now, resulting in a cutting of several thousand jobs since 2014. Last November the company announced it was cutting up to seven percent in its international workforce, and that was even after the company cut jobs at its Tennessee Eggo plant in June. And in 2014 Kellogg closed down a plant in London, Ontario, Canada with a loss of about 500 jobs. The announcement of yet another round of job cuts comes after the company decided to cut its advertising with Breitbart News at the end of 2016, thereby snubbing Breitbart’s 45, 000, 000 readers. In November, Kellogg noted that Breitbart News’s conservative readers are not “aligned with our values as a company. ” While the decision by Kellogg to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com. it did represent an escalation in the war by leftist companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House.

"Trump ordered Syrian air strike before dinner with Xi WASHINGTON/PALM BEACH (Reuters) - In a secure room at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, President Donald Trump’s top military advisers presented him with three options for punishing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a poison gas attack that killed dozens of civilians.     It was Thursday afternoon, just hours before 59 U.S. cruise missiles would rain down on a Syrian military airfield in response to what Trump had called “a disgrace to humanity.”  Trump was at his Florida estate for his first summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But that summit took a backseat to the top-secret briefing by U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, an official familiar with the briefing told Reuters. McMaster and Mattis presented Trump with three options, which were quickly narrowed to two: bomb multiple airfields or just the Shayrat airfield near the city of Homs, where the military jet carrying the poison gas had taken off, the official said. At least 70 people, including 20 children, were killed in the gas attack in northern Syria. Russia, which has military forces in Syria aiding Assad’s government, says the deaths were caused by a gas leak from a depot where rebel groups stored chemical weapons, a charge the rebels deny and U.S. intelligence officials say is false. After listening to an argument that it was best to minimize both Russian and Arab casualties, the official said, Trump chose the minimum option and ordered the launch of a barrage of cruise missiles against the Shayrat air field.  Mattis and McMaster argued that choosing that target would draw the clearest line between Assad’s use of nerve gas and the retaliatory strike, the official said. In addition, the living quarters occupied by Russian advisers, Syrian airmen and some civilian workers were on the periphery of the airfield, which meant it could be destroyed without risking hundreds of casualties — especially if the attack occurred outside the base’s normal working hours. Another official privy to the discussions said the administration has contingency plans for possible additional strikes as early as Friday night, depending on how Assad responds to the first attack. “Whether this is over is up to President Assad,” said this official. “We have additional options ready to go.” Confronting his first foreign policy crisis, Trump relied largely on seasoned military officers — Mattis, a former Marine  general, and McMaster, a U.S. Army lieutenant general — rather than the political operatives who had dominated his policy decisions in the first weeks of his presidency, said three officials involved in the deliberations. After news of the gas attack first surfaced on Tuesday, Trump immediately requested a list of options to punish Assad, according to two senior officials who took part in those meetings. The officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations and intelligence matters. Senior administration officials said they met with Trump as early as Tuesday evening and presented options including sanctions, diplomatic pressure and plans for a variety of military strikes on Syria, all of them drawn up well before he took office. The most aggressive option on the shelf, one of the officials said, called for a “decapitation” strike on Assad’s presidential palace, which sits alone on a hill west of downtown Damascus. “He had a lot of questions and said he wanted to think about it but he also had some points he wanted to make. He wanted the options refined,” one official said.  On Wednesday morning, intelligence officials and Trump’s military advisers said they were certain which Syrian air base was used to launch the chemical attack and that they had tracked the Sukhoi-22 jet that carried it out.  Trump told them to focus on the military plans. “It was a matter of dusting those off and adapting them for the current target set and timing,” said another official. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump appeared in the White House Rose Garden and said the “unspeakable” attack against “even beautiful little babies” had changed his attitude toward Assad. Asked then whether he was formulating a new policy on Syria, Trump replied: “You’ll see.” At about 3:45 p.m on Thursday afternoon, General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff called an unscheduled meeting of the service chiefs at the Pentagon to finalize the plan for the military strikes. Shortly after 4 p.m., Trump signed off on the missile attacks, according to the White House.  Two U.S. warships – the USS Ross and the USS Porter – fired 59 cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean Sea at the targeted air base. They began landing at around 8:40 p.m. ET (00:40 GMT), just as the two presidents were finishing their meals. ",0
"UK's May needs parliament to back deal with N.Irish party - campaigner LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May must seek parliamentary approval for a billion-pound deal with a Northern Irish party that propped up her government after an inconclusive election, a legal campaigner quoted government lawyers as saying on Monday. After losing her majority at the June 8 election, May s Conservative Party secured the support of the small Democratic Unionist Party which allowed her to form a minority government. Northern Ireland would get 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) extra funding as part of the deal, the government said at the time. [nL8N1JN0LL] But, citing correspondence with government lawyers, campaigner Gina Miller, who defeated ministers in an earlier high-profile legal case over the process for triggering Britain s exit from the European Union, said the deal could not be executed without parliamentary approval.  Alongside a statement condemning the government for not making the need for parliamentary approval public, Miller released a letter from the government s legal department.  The agreement does not, and could not, involve the Government providing or committing itself to any provision of additional funds to Northern Ireland which would not be authorised under standard procedures, including the consent of Parliament,  the letter said. A spokesman from May s office said all government spending required parliamentary authorisation, and that its focus in Northern Ireland was on ending a political stalemate that has left it without a regional government for eight months. Any parliamentary vote would be expected to pass with the support of Conservative and DUP lawmakers, but could invite further unwelcome scrutiny of a deal which has been heavily criticised by political opponents.  The opposition Labour Party described it as a  bribe  and said the government needed to be clear about how it would be paid for. In January, Miller successfully challenged the government s plan to begin EU divorce proceedings without first seeking parliamentary approval. After a Supreme Court ruling sided with Miller in that case, May was forced to pass legislation through parliament. ",0
"Stockholm Attacker Was ’Rejected Asylum Seeker’: British Citizen Among Dead Swedish police revealed Sunday the Uzbekistan citizen suspected of driving a stolen lorry into crowds killing four on Friday was a rejected asylum seeker who was wanted for deportation. [The    man was due to be expelled from Sweden, reports the country’s   newspaper AftonBladet. Police commander Jonas Hysing told the paper “we do not know where they are, so we can not enforce expulsion” speaking of the many migrants who should be deported from the country but the government keeps no records of their whereabouts.  The officer also confirmed police were aware that the suspect had expressed an interest and sympathy for the Islamic State online. According to the report, the man applied for a residence permit in 2014, and that it took until 2016 for it to be rejected, with the Asylum board ruling he should be deported. Officers called at his registered address in February 2017 but found he didn’t live there. Two months later it is believed the suspect stole a delivery lorry and drove through crowds and then into a department store in Stockholm, killing four and injuring 15. One of those identified as having died in the attack was a British citizen. Another was Belgian, and two more were Swedish citizens. No identities other than nationalities have yet been made public. Breitbart London reports Sunday that the suspect travelled to Sweden to make money in the construction trade. A source said of the man “He just wanted to make money, that’s why he was in Sweden and worked as a construction worker. His wife and children still live abroad”. This is not the first time in recent history that a rejected asylum seeker due to be deported by the Swedish government has gone on to launch an attack against citizens in the country. Breitbart London reported on the Ikea attack in August 2015 where Eritrean migrant Abraham Ukbagabir took a packet of knives in the shop’s kitchenware department and stabbed two shoppers to death before attempting to kill himself. He later told investigators he struck because he wanted “revenge” against Sweden for having his asylum application rejected. Despite having been so keen to stay in Sweden in 2015, the killer has since complained he doesn’t like Swedish prisons and wants to be transferred to one in Eritrea.",0

"Zimbabwe court grants bail to U.S. citizen charged with subversion HARARE (Reuters) - A high court judge in Zimbabwe said on Thursday the state s case against a U.S. citizen charged with trying to subvert President Robert Mugabe s government lacked facts and ordered that she be granted bail. Martha O Donovan has been in prison since Saturday, a day after she was arrested on accusations of insulting Mugabe in a Twitter post. Police later leveled the more serious charge of subversion, which carries a possible 20-year jail term. She denies both charges. O Donovan works for Magamba TV, which describes itself as Zimbabwe s leading producer of political satire. In granting her bail, High Court Judge Clement Phiri said there was a  patent absence of facts  in the state s case.  The applicant has demonstrated that she should be granted bail. It is my finding that it is in the interests of justice that the applicant be given bail,  Phiri said. O Donovan was not in court. Phiri ordered her to deposit $1,000 with the court, surrender her passport and report to the criminal investigations department twice a week as part of her bail conditions. Her lawyer Obey Shava said O Donovan would be released on Friday after completing administrative procedures. Amnesty International said in a statement the case showed that Zimbabwean authorities had contempt for freedom of expression. The state s case centers on a Twitter post it says she wrote in October calling Mugabe a  selfish and sick man . The government set up a Ministry of Cyber Security last month. Zimbabwe is facing acute shortages of foreign exchange and cash. The country is also concerned with who will succeed Mugabe, 93, who has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980. He plans to contest next year s election. This week Mugabe fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa from the government and ruling party for  disloyalty . Mnangagawa was seen as a potential successor.  Formal opposition to Mugabe is limited but the government is wary of social media. Last year, activists including pastor Evan Mawarire used it to organize the #ThisFlag movement. Its stay-at-home demonstration was the biggest protest in a decade. ",0
"Catalans have no choice but to delay, says former adviser BELGRADE (Reuters) - Catalonia s president has no choice but to suspend secession since it is unlikely anyone will recognize the Spanish region on the basis of a disputed referendum, a former British diplomat who has advised the Catalans and other secessionist movements said. Carne Ross, who as founder of the diplomatic consultancy Independent Diplomat has worked with Kosovo, South Sudan, Western Sahara and Catalonia on their respective bids for sovereignty, said there would be no solution to the crisis without a legal plebiscite agreed to by Madrid.  To get there would require pressure from Spain s European Union partners, Ross told Reuters in a telephone interview.  A full declaration of independence would have been very problematic, would have led to obvious confrontation with Madrid and he (Catalan President Carles Puigdemont) was under enormous pressure not to declare independence, including I assume from the countries that Catalonia would look to for recognition,  said Ross.   At the end of the day, if you re to be independent, you need to be recognized as such.   I think they are only likely to get international recognition if there is a legal referendum that Madrid accepts.  Puigdemont declared on Tuesday that Catalonia had the mandate for independence but proposed suspending sovereignty to allow for talks with Madrid on an agreed solution. On Wednesday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for clarity as to whether or not Catalonia had declared independence and raised the specter of Madrid suspending the region s autonomy. Catalonia s Oct. 1 referendum was declared illegal by a Spanish high court and mustered only 43 percent turnout as many independence opponents stayed at home. Hundreds of people were injured by baton-wielding police as they intervened to close polling stations. Ross said many Catalans had been  radicalized  by Madrid s resistance and police behavior.  Fuel has been added to the fire,  he said.  In my view, legitimate independence can only be legitimately declared when it has a clear majority of the population. I don t think it is right to declare independence when you don t have that clear majority. And as things currently stand, Catalonia does not have that clear majority.  Ross formerly headed the Middle East section of the British mission to the United Nations but resigned from the civil service in 2004 over the invasion of Iraq. His work with Independent Diplomat was the subject of the documentary Accidental Anarchist that was broadcast in July on the BBC. Ross, who advised the Catalan government between July 2013 and September 2015 and is a committed advocate of self-determination, said it was  unrealistic  to expect a mediated solution resulting in, for instance, greater autonomy for Catalonia.  He cited the examples of Montenegro and Scotland, in which referendums were held on the basis of negotiated terms in 2006 and 2014 respectively. Montenegro narrowly voted to leave a state union with Serbia, while a majority of Scots opted to remain with Britain.  I think that the international community should be calling for Madrid to do what Britain did with Scotland, which is to allow a legal referendum to resolve this once and for all.  French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected a call by Puigdemont for EU mediation, but Ross said the bloc should state clearly to Madrid  that it needs to find a more consensual solution . Asked if the Catalans had erred in holding a referendum that Madrid did not agree to, Ross replied:  They had no other option to build up the pressure for that dialogue.  ",0
"Turkish air strikes kill 29 Kurdish militants in northern Iraq: army ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish warplanes hit Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) targets in northern Iraq on Monday and killed 29 of the group s militants, Turkey s armed forces said. The PKK fighters were believed to be preparing an attack on Turkish border posts from the Hakurk and Metina regions of northern Iraq, the army said in a written statement. Several caves and shelters used by the militants were destroyed in the air strikes, it said. The PKK, which has been waging an insurgency in southeast Turkey since the 1980s, is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. ",0
"U.S. carries out first strikes against Islamic State in Somalia WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States carried out its first air strikes against Islamic State militants in Somalia and killed  several terrorists,  the U.S. military said on Friday.  The Pentagon s Africa Command said the first strike was carried out at midnight local time (2100 GMT, Thursday) and another one at 11 a.m. on Nov. 3.   Several terrorists  were killed, the military said in a statement, adding that the strikes were conducted in coordination with Somalia s government.   U.S. forces will continue to use all authorized and appropriate measures to protect Americans and to disable terrorist threats,  the statement said. Islamic State has been gathering recruits in the region, although experts say the scale of its force is unclear and it remains a small player compared to the al Shabaab group. Last month, a group loyal to Islamic State seized a small port town in Somalia s semi-autonomous Puntland region, the first town it has taken since emerging a year ago. The group, which refers to itself simply as Islamic State, is a rival to the larger al Shabaab force, which is linked to Islamic State s rival al Qaeda and once controlled much of Somalia. The United States has occasionally carried out strikes against al Shabaab militants in Somalia, which retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center and carries out gun and bomb attacks. The al Shabaab group aims to drive out the peacekeepers, topple Somalia s Western-backed government and impose its strict version of Islam on the Horn of Africa state. More than 350 people were killed in twin bombings in the Somali capital Mogadishu last month, the deadliest attack in the country s history. Earlier this year, the White House granted the U.S. military broader authority to carry out strikes in Somalia against al Shabaab. ",0
"Obama says Chinese-led trade deal shows need for TPP: Washington Post WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday that a Chinese-led regional trade deal demonstrated the urgent need for Congress to approve the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. Obama has been pushing to finalize the TPP before he leaves office on Jan. 20, but he needs to overcome strong anti-trade sentiment from both the left wing of his own Democratic Party  as well as from the right flank of the Republican Party. Voter anxiety over the impact of trade deals on jobs and the environment has featured large in the campaigns of Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for the Nov. 8 presidential election, and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. In an opinion piece published on the website of the Washington Post on Monday, Obama said he understood voter skepticism but that “building walls to isolate ourselves from the global economy” would backfire on the American economy. “China is negotiating a trade deal that would carve up some of the fastest-growing markets in the world at our expense, putting American jobs, businesses and goods at risk,” Obama said in the piece. Obama was referring to the 16-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, and noted that China was seeking to finalize the deal by the end of the year. “That trade deal won’t prevent unfair competition among government-subsidized, state-owned enterprises. It won’t protect a free and open Internet,” Obama said, also criticizing the RCEP’s lack of protections for intellectual property, labor standards and the environment. Obama, who plans a visit to TPP partners Japan and Vietnam later this month, argued the TPP would allow America to “call the shots” on trade with Asia. “That’s why my administration is working closely with leaders in congress to secure bipartisan approval for our trade agreement, mindful that the longer we wait, the harder it will be to pass the TPP,” he said. Asked about Obama’s comments, China’s Foreign Ministry said global trade rules should be discussed by all countries, not just set by one. China has an open attitude towards TPP, which should be promoted together along with RCEP to help achieve the goal of a free trade zone in the Asia Pacific, ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing in Beijing.

"Trump, Clinton tension seeps into jokes at annual charity dinner NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. presidential campaign tensions seeped into a high-profile charity dinner on Thursday as Donald Trump joked about sending Hillary Clinton to prison and she alluded to Trump’s statements about women by estimating how he might rate the Statue of Liberty’s attractiveness a four, maybe a five. The candidates shared the stage at a formal dinner in New York City named for the state’s former governor, Alfred E. Smith, less than 24 hours after finishing their third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The annual event, which raises money for needy children, typically offers presidential hopefuls a respite from the tension of the campaign trail. But Trump and Clinton opted to instead trade sharpened barbs that reflected the acrimony of the 2016 White House campaign. Trump spoke first and set the room on edge with bitter jabs at his rival, with his label of Clinton as “corrupt” drawing boos. “With all of the heated back and forth between my opponent and me at the debate last night, we have proven that we can actually be civil to each other,” Trump said. “In fact just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said, ‘Pardon me.’” “And I very politely replied, ‘Let me talk to you about that after I get into office,’” said Trump, a Republican whose supporters chant “lock her up” at rallies. Clinton, whose remarks elicited both polite applause and derision, riffed off Trump’s derogatory remarks about women’s appearances, such as joking in a 2002 radio interview that they become less attractive after age 35. “Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four, maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,” Clinton said of the New York City landmark. “Come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman? 45,” Clinton said. The president elected on Nov. 8 will be the 45th in U.S. history. Trump and Clinton sat just a seat apart on the dais, separated by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York. At the event’s conclusion, they shook hands – a gesture they avoided at Wednesday’s debate.  But the tone of both candidates’ remarks was a departure from the past, when political figures and presidential candidates have stuck to a largely self-deprecating and good-natured brand of humor. At one point at the event, which raised $6 million for Catholic charities supporting children, Trump said Clinton was “pretending not to hate Catholics.”  Trump was referring to the apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, published by Wikileaks, which show Clinton staffers criticizing high-profile figures for embracing Catholicism as the most “politically acceptable” of socially conservative religions. Alfred Smith IV, the evening’s host, perhaps best reflected the tension in the room, and the campaign, in his introductory remarks: “This has been a campaign for the history books,” he said. “It has also been a campaign for the psychiatry books.”     ",0

She said, “We certainly need to revisit and review whether or not you should be allowed to check firearms in your checked baggage and travel with them. ”  She also floated the option of creating a secure area where people who check guns have to go to pick up their firearm. And her third option was a ban on checking ammunition. Lost on Wasserman Schultz is the fact that Florida is one of only six states where it is illegal for concealed carry permit holders to carry a gun in unsecured areas for  . So large groups of unarmed innocents stand together in areas of the airport that lack security it is a mass public attacker’s dream come true. Banning guns in checked baggage would do nothing to stop further attacks, as a criminal or terrorist with a gun can walk into the unsecured areas from the pickup curb and kill easily. The solution here is clear: eradicate the law that mandates that concealed carry permit holders be disarmed in baggage claim areas. This is a   action, rather than a federal one, and Representative Jake Raburn ( ) has already introduced legislation to repeal the   requirements. Under Raburn’s plan, criminals and terrorists will have to deal with the fact that   citizens can shoot back.

"Democratic fund-raising group for Congress candidates confirms hack WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A committee that raises money for Democratic candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives confirmed on Friday it had been hacked in an intrusion possibly linked to Russian hackers, similar to an earlier breach targeting another Democratic Party group. In an incident that escalated concerns about the potential for Russian meddling in U.S. politics, Reuters first reported on Thursday that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing the hack at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC. The intrusion took place from at least June 19 to June 27, though it may have been longer, according to analysis conducted by U.S. network security company FireEye.  The committee said in a statement it has hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to investigate. “We have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network,” the committee said. “We are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.” The DCCC hack may be related to an earlier hack against the Democratic National Committee, which raises money and sets strategy for Democratic candidates nationwide. The DNC and DCCC occupy the same office building in Washington. Potential links to Russian hackers in both incidents were likely to heighten accusations, so far unproven, that Moscow is trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election campaign to help Republican nominee Donald Trump. The Kremlin denied involvement in the DNC cyber attack. In June, a bogus website was registered with a name resembling a DCCC donation site. For some time, donation-related internet traffic that was supposed to go to a donation-processing firm instead went to the fake site. The DCCC intrusion may have been used to compromise the computer systems of donors who visited the spoof site, rather than to collect their personal information, said John Hultquist, manager of cyber espionage analysis at FireEye. Several major Democratic donors contacted by Reuters on Friday said they had not been notified of the hack and were not concerned about their information being accessed.  “I’m less concerned about that than I am about my Amex being hacked,” said John Morgan, 60, a Florida attorney. Cindy Miscikowski, 68, a California donor, said she would be upset if hackers got her bank information, but otherwise she was not worried because donations are disclosed publicly.    The timeframe of the DCCC hack would place it days after the DNC went public with its breach and said the hackers had been kicked out of its systems.  Sources said the numerical Internet address of the spurious DCCC site resembled one used by a Russian government-linked hacking group, one of two suspected in the DNC breach. Rich Barger, co-founder of security intelligence firm ThreatConnect Inc, said his analysis of the fake donation site tied it to the group linked to Russian military intelligence.  He said the web domain name was set up through a service that accepts bitcoin, with a contact email address that had been used to set up websites involved in a major German hack, which also was attributed to the Russian group. Cyber experts and U.S. officials said this week there was evidence that Russia engineered the DNC hack to release sensitive party emails and influence U.S. politics. The DNC hack raised concerns among Democrats at the party’s convention in Philadelphia, where Hillary Clinton was nominated as the party’s candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The new hack at the DCCC could add pressure on the Obama administration to make a public accusation or retaliate. The Justice Department and other agencies have said it is important for deterrence to “name and shame” cyber adversaries. “Any efforts on a nation state’s part to interfere with U.S. politics through cyber attacks would appear to cross a line that would demand a response from the U.S. government,” said D.J. Rosenthal, a former Justice Department and National Security Council official. A former White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any formal accusation would require overwhelmingly certain evidence. Staffers for the Republican National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said separately that those campaign organizing groups had not been hacked. ",0

"Officials to Close Standing Rock Protest Campsite - The New York Times Citing public safety concerns, federal officials plan to close access to a campsite where demonstrators have protested the construction of a crude oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota and create a “free speech zone. ” The Army Corps of Engineers, in a letter Friday to the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Dave Archambault II, said the decision had been made to “protect the general public from the violent confrontations between protesters and law enforcement officials that have occurred in this area. ” Mr. Archambault said in a statement that the tribe was “deeply disappointed” by the decision. “It is both unfortunate and disrespectful that this announcement comes the day after this country celebrates Thanksgiving  —   a historic exchange between Native Americans and the first immigrants from Europe,” he said. “Although the news is saddening, it is not all surprising given the last 500 years of mistreatment of our people. ” The authorities will close the area north of the Cannonball River, including the Oceti Sakowin camp, about 40 miles south of Bismarck, where opponents of the   Dakota Access Pipeline have gathered for months. Native American tribes, led by the Standing Rock Sioux, have been protesting the pipeline project. They fear it would pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds. There have been large protests at the Lake Oahe crossing the Missouri River is the tribe’s primary source of drinking water. Mr. Archambault said the best way to protect demonstrators during the winter and to reduce conflicts with the police “is to deny the easement for the Oahe crossing and deny it now. ” The letter from the district commander of the Army Corps, Col. John W. Henderson, said the emergency services and facilities needed to protect demonstrators camped north of the Cannonball River during the harsh North Dakota winters could not be provided. “I do not take this action lightly but have decided that it is required due to the concern for public safety and the fact that much of this land is leased to private persons for grazing   haying purposes as part of the corps’ land management practices,” he wrote. He said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing. The project has spurred months of clashes between the police and demonstrators. The most serious injury happened early Monday. An explosion during a protest badly damaged the left arm and hand of woman who grew up in the Bronx, Sophia Wilansky, 21. Her father, Wayne Wilansky, said that someone from the police lines had thrown a device he described as a grenade the police suggested that fellow demonstrators had caused the explosion, and said officers did not use concussion or flash grenades at any time. On Monday, the police confronted hundreds of protesters. Nearly 300 people were treated for injuries resulting from the use of police force, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. The pipeline project was delayed in September when the Obama administration temporarily blocked it from crossing under the Missouri River. President Obama called on both sides to show restraint and revealed that the Army Corps of Engineers was considering an alternative route for the project. But Kelcy Warren, chief executive of the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press it would not consider a different route. Though the project has been delayed by legal disputes, the pipeline is nearly complete.",0
"U.S. Commando Killed in Yemen in Trump’s First Counterterrorism Operation - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   One American commando was killed and three others were wounded in a fierce firefight early Sunday with Qaeda militants in central Yemen, the military said on Sunday. It was the first counterterrorism operation authorized by President Trump since he took office, and the commando was the first United States service member to die in the yearslong shadow war against Al Qaeda’s Yemen affiliate. Members of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 carried out the surprise dawn attack, and the military said that about 14 Qaeda fighters were killed during a nearly hourlong battle. A Qaeda leader  —   a    of Anwar   the   cleric and top Qaeda leader in Yemen, who died in a drone strike in 2011  —   was believed to have been killed. After initially denying that there were any civilian casualties, American officials said they were assessing reports that women and children had died in the attack. The military’s Joint Special Operations Command had been planning the mission for months, according to three senior American officials. Obama administration aides had deliberated extensively over the proposed operation, weighing the value of any information that might be recovered against the risk to the Special Operations forces plunging into hostile territory. But administration officials ultimately opted to hand the decision on the mission to their successors. Mr. Trump, who has vowed to increase pressure on militant groups worldwide, was quickly persuaded that the rewards were worth the gamble, and he authorized the mission last week, military officials said. Commandos waited for a moonless evening on Saturday to exploit their advantage of fighting at night. As helicopter gunships and armed Reaper drones provided cover, the commandos carried out the attack against the home of the Qaeda leader in the rugged mountainous region of Bayda Province, a part of Yemen that has been a focal point of United States military operations over the past month. The main target was computer materials inside the house that could contain clues about future terrorist plots. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump called the raid “successful” and said that it had captured “important intelligence that will assist the U. S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world. ” He also lamented the loss of the American service member “in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism. ” The military’s Central Command said in an earlier statement on Sunday that “similar operations have produced intelligence on Al Qaeda logistics, recruiting and financing efforts. ” In previous raids in Iraq, Syria and Somalia, commandos have recovered laptop computers, thumb drives and cellphones that yielded important information about militant leaders’ locations, activities and associates. A United States military aircraft helping with the operation experienced a “hard landing” near the site of the raid, resulting in injuries to two other service members, military officials said. That aircraft, identified by a senior American official as an Osprey that was evacuating the troops wounded in the firefight, was unable to fly after the landing and was deliberately destroyed by American airstrikes. The wounded troops and the Osprey’s crew were lifted to safety by another American aircraft. American officials and analysts said the Qaeda leader who was believed to have been killed was Abdulrauf al Dhahab. The raid took place in Yemen around the time that Mr. Trump was signing a directive in Washington on Saturday afternoon ordering Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to devise within 30 days a more aggressive plan to defeat the Islamic State. The Islamic State was born from Al Qaeda’s branch in Iraq, but the two terrorist organizations are now sworn rivals not only in Iraq and Syria, but also in other hot spots like Yemen and Afghanistan, where both groups have affiliates. Because Mr. Trump had been explicit about his intention to ask for the review to accelerate the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, American military planners had begun drafting classified options to present to the new commander in chief. Some of those options, like pushing more authority to conduct strikes to commanders in the field or loosening restrictions designed to limit the risk to civilians, could also be applied to attacks against Qaeda fighters and Islamic State insurgents. There were no immediate indications that the rules of engagement had been loosened for the mission in Yemen, military officials said. The Central Command’s statement did not elaborate on details of the raid or identify the commando who was killed. A local resident who witnessed the raid, speaking by phone, said he had seen warplanes bombing several houses in the village around 2 a. m. Sunday. The man said he had seen at least three buildings being struck before he fled. He did not want to be identified because he feared that speaking out would endanger his life. A Yemeni government official in Bayda Province said the targeted buildings belonged to the Dhahab family, which is known for its ties to Al Qaeda. Two male members of the family have been killed in drone strikes over the past two years. The Yemeni official said that at least eight women and seven children, ages 3 to 13, had been killed in the raid. Qaeda supporters said that Mr. Awlaki’s young daughter was among the dead and denied that any senior Qaeda leaders had been killed, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist communications. Faisal Mohamed, a Bayda official whose two sons witnessed the attack, said it severely damaged a school, a health facility and a mosque. “I was on the way back to town when they called and said that there were Americans everywhere, so I knew I should not go,” Mr. Mohamed said by phone from nearby Marib Province. “My kids told me that the sky was crowded with helicopters and that they saw people jumping out of planes. ” “The last thing they said to me was that the whole town is devastated now,” Mr. Mohamed said. Just over a week ago, United States drone strikes killed three other men suspected of being Qaeda operatives in Bayda Province, the first such killings reported in the country since Mr. Trump assumed the presidency. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group’s branch in Yemen, has long been seen by American intelligence and counterterrorism officials as among the most dangerous branches of the global terrorist network, and the one posing the most immediate threat to United States territory. The group’s leaders have sought in at least three cases to detonate bombs hidden aboard American commercial jetliners. All of those plots were thwarted. The raid on Saturday night was the latest in a series of Special Operations drone strikes and ground attacks in Yemen in recent years. In November 2014,   Special Operations commandos and Yemeni troops rescued eight hostages being held in a remote part of eastern Yemen by Al Qaeda’s affiliate there. After landing, the commandos hiked some distance in the dark to a mountainside cave, where they surprised the militants holding the captives. A month later, in December 2014, United States commandos stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. But the raid ended in tragedy, with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him.",0
"Turkey orders arrest of 110 people over Gulen links: media ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish authorities issued arrest warrants for 110 people from a seized company over alleged links to the U.S.-based cleric who Ankara says orchestrated last year s attempted coup, Dogan news agency and other media said on Friday. It said the police operation to seize the suspects, who were managers, partners and employees of the publishing group Kaynak Holding and related companies, was focused on Istanbul but spread across 24 provinces. Kaynak Holding was seized by the state in 2015 over links to the movement of Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. He has denied involvement in the July 2016 abortive putsch. Hundreds of firms like Kaynak, many of them smaller provincial businesses, were seized by authorities in a post-coup crackdown and are now run by government-appointed administrators. Under the crackdown, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to Gulen, while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military, public and private sectors. In a separate operation centered in Ankara, 38 former employees from schools owned by the Gulen network were arrested on Friday, according to Turkish media. The schools were closed by a decree after the failed coup. The government dismisses rights groups  concerns about the crackdown, saying only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by Gulen s network, which it says infiltrated institutions such as the judiciary, army and schools.

"Former Yemeni strongman Saleh played his last hand and lost DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen s steely former president of 33 years, Ali Abdullah Saleh, made his last political gamble and lost on Monday, meeting his death at the hands of the Houthi movement, his erstwhile allies in the country s multi-sided civil war. Officials in his General People s Congress party (GPC) confirmed to Reuters that the 75-year-old Saleh had been killed outside the capital Sanaa in what Houthi sources said was an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) and gun attack.  A master of weaving alliances and advancing his personal and family interests in Yemen s heavily armed and deeply fractious tribal society, Saleh unified his country by force, but he also helped guide it toward collapse in its latest war. The Middle East s arch-survivor once compared running Yemen to  dancing on the heads of snakes , ruling with expertly balanced doses of largesse and force.   He outlived other Arab leaders who were left dead or deposed by uprisings and civil wars since 2011. Cornered by pro-democracy  Arab Spring  protests, Saleh wore a cryptic smile when signing his resignation in a televised ceremony in 2012.  Saleh waged six wars against the Houthis from 2002 to 2009 before he made an impromptu alliance with the group that seized the capital Sanaa in 2014 and eventually turned on him. The two sides feuded for years for supremacy over territory they ran together. The Houthis probably never forgave his forces for killing their founder and father of the current leader. Fearing the Houthis are a proxy for their arch-foe Iran, the mostly Gulf Arab alliance sought to help the internationally recognized Yemeni government win the conflict.  Saleh s army loyalists and Houthi fighters together weathered thousands of air strikes by a Saudi-led military coalition in almost three years of war. As the conflict wrought a humanitarian crisis, mutual sniping about responsibility for economic woes in northern Yemeni lands that they together rule peaked on Wednesday when the capital erupted in gunbattles between their partisans. ARCH-SURVIVOR Saleh had seemed unshakeable in one of the world s poorest and unstable countries. He managed to play his enemies off against each other as tribal warfare, separatist movements and Islamist militants destabilized Yemen. He survived a bomb attack in his palace mosque in 2011 which killed senior aides and disfigured him. As other leaders were toppled by the Arab Spring uprisings, he found a way to retire peacefully to his villa in the capital and plot a comeback. Despite being forced to step down in 2012 under a Gulf-brokered transition plan following protests against his rule, Saleh won immunity in the deal and remained a powerful political player. The ever-nimble Saleh was a pivotal figure in the war, which has killed at least 10,000 people, displaced 2 million from their homes, led to widespread hunger and a cholera epidemic. Saleh became the ruler of North Yemen in 1978 at a time when the south was a separate, communist state, and led the unified country after the two states merged in 1990. Opponents often complained that Yemen under Saleh failed to meet the basic needs of the country s people, where two of every three live on less than $2 per day.  Saleh managed to keep Western and Arab powers on his side, styling himself as a key ally of the United States in its war on terrorism. He received tens of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid for units commanded by his relatives. After the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks against U.S. cities, Yemen came onto Washington s radar as a source of foot soldiers for Osama bin Laden s al Qaeda network. Bin Laden was born in Saudi Arabia though his family came from Yemen s Hadramaut region. Saleh cooperated with U.S. authorities as the CIA stepped up a campaign of drone strikes against key al Qaeda figures, which also led to scores of civilian deaths. Born in 1942 near Sanaa, he received only limited education before joining the military as a non-commissioned officer. His first break came when President Ahmed al-Ghashmi, who came from the same Hashed tribe as Saleh, appointed him military governor of Taiz, North Yemen s second city. When Ghashmi was killed by a bomb in 1978, Saleh replaced him. In 1990, the collapse of the Soviet Union helped propel North Yemen under Saleh and the socialist South Yemen state into a unification.     Saleh angered Gulf Arab allies by staying close to Saddam Hussein during the 1990-91 Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, leading to the expulsion of up to 1 million Yemenis from Saudi Arabia.  But he then won plaudits from Western powers for carrying out economic reforms drawn up by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and made efforts to attract foreign investors. He swept to victory when southerners tried to secede from united Yemen in 1994 and drew closer to Saudi Arabia, which he allowed to spread its radical Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam.  Saleh s son, Ahmed Ali, lives under house arrest in the United Arab Emirates, where he once served as ambassador before it joined ally Saudi Arabia to make war on the Houthi-Saleh alliance. Ahmed Ali, a powerful former military commander whom his father appeared to be grooming to succeed him, may the family s last chance to win back influence. ",0
"Kuwait arrests five over video deemed offensive to crown prince DUBAI (Reuters) - Kuwait arrested five suspects accused of posting a video on social media considered offensive to the Gulf state s crown prince, the interior ministry said on Tuesday. The accused were government employees with positions at  important institutions within the state , the interior ministry said in a statement carried by state news agency KUNA. In recent days, a clip has circulated on social media showing the crown prince jabbing his finger at dignitaries at a Gulf football event, apparently trying to tell them who should be first to shake the hand of the ruling emir. It was not immediately clear if that video was the subject of the legal charges. ",0
"Lawmakers urge U.S. to craft targeted sanctions on Myanmar military WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 40 lawmakers urged the Trump administration on Wednesday to reimpose U.S. travel bans on Myanmar’s military leaders and prepare targeted sanctions against those responsible for a crackdown on the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority. In a letter sent to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a group of Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives called for “meaningful steps” against Myanmar’s military and others who have committed human rights abuses in an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the Southeast Asian nation. “Burma’s authorities appear to be in denial of what has happened,” stated the letter. “We urge you to do everything possible to ensure protection and security for those trapped inside Burma or willing to return, as well as oppose forcible returns from neighboring countries.” ",0
"Syrian, Iranian backed forces advance in border area near Israel AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian army forces backed by Iranian-backed militias pushed deeper into the last rebel-held enclave near a strategic border area with Israel and Lebanon in a new expansion of Tehran s influence in the war-torn country. The army and the Shi ite forces helped by Druze militias in the area advanced east and south of the Sunni-rebel held bastion of Beit Jin backed by some of the heaviest aerial bombing and artillery shelling since a major assault began more than two months ago to seize the area, rebels said. The Syrian army said it had encircled the village of Mughr al Meer at the foothills of Mount Hermon as troops moved toward Beit Jin amid fierce clashes. On Monday, the army said they had cut off insurgent supply lines and made further advances.  The enclave is the last rebel bastion left in the southwest of Damascus known as the Western Ghouta that had since last year fallen under government control after months of heavy bombing on civilian areas and years of siege tactics that forced rebels to surrender. A western intelligence source confirmed rebel reports that Iranian-backed local militias alongside commanders from the powerful Lebanese Hezbollah Shi ite group were playing a major role in the ongoing battles. Tehran was pushing to establish a strategic presence along the Israeli border in the Syrian Golan Heights, the source said.  Rebels said they had repelled several attempts to storm their defenses and denied reports they were about to surrender.  The Iranian-backed militias are trying to consolidate their sphere of influence all the way from southwest of Damascus to the Israeli border,  said Suhaib al Ruhail, an official from the Liwa al Furqan rebel group that operates in the area. Worried by Iran s expanding influence in Syria after the defeat of Islamic State, Israel has in recent weeks stepped up its strikes against suspected Iranian targets inside Syria. Early this month there was an Israeli strike on a base near Kiswah, south of Damascus, that was widely believed to be an Iranian military compound, a Western intelligence source said. Israel has been lobbying Washington and Moscow to deny Iran, Lebanon s Hezbollah and other Shi ite militias any permanent bases in Syria, and to keep them away from the Golan, as they gain ground while helping Damascus beat back Sunni-led rebels. The southwest of Syria is part of a de-escalation zone in southern Syria agreed last July between Russia and the United States, the first such understanding between the two powers. The area has not seen Russian bombing, unlike other ceasefire areas in Syria. Diplomatic sources say several thousand Shi ite and Druze fighters are pitted against hundreds of Sunni jihadists and mainstream Free Syria Army (FSA) rebels closing ranks under the banner of Itihad Quwt Jabal al Sheikh, or  Union of fighters of Jabal al Sheikh . They are mainly drawn from local fighters from the area. With the army and Iranian backed offensive widening, the Sunni rebels have called on youths to enlist, while mosque imams in Beit Jin called on people to take up arms and fight the army. Rebels still have a sizeable presence in central and southern Quneitra, in the Syrian Golan Heights. Western diplomatic sources say the crushing of the Sunni rebel presence in areas they have been in since 2013 will allow Lebanon s Hezbollah to open another secure arms supply line from its border in southern Lebanon into Syria. Since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, Iran has had a growing presence in the country, deploying thousands of Shi ite fighters drawn from Iraq and Afghanistan who have fought against both mainstream Sunni rebel groups and more militant groups.

"Trump likely to face questions over travel ban in meeting with CEOs WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will likely face questions about  his executive order restricting some travel to the United States when he meets with the CEOs of major U.S. companies at the White House on Friday. Companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the president’s business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), IBM Corp (IBM.N), Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Activists are already pressuring the CEOs to raise concerns about the travel restrictions at the meeting, which comes at the end of another turbulent week for the Trump administration. Trump’s order last Friday, barring travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, touched off public protests and stirred unease among employees at many big U.S. companies. CEOs have been faced with difficult choices to either criticize Trump’s move at a time when they are trying to win White House support on tax and trade policies, or remain silent and take heat from consumers and employees dismayed by the order. The Trump administration says the travel ban is aimed at strengthening national security. Backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post-inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on Wednesday.  Trump’s executive order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the United States and drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that “the ban will impact many innocent people — an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump’s first business advisory group meeting.” Trump will kick off the two-hour meeting with an address lasting 10-15 minutes and will be followed by Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group Blackstone (BX.N), who chairs the panel and assembled it at  Trump’s request. Four topics will be discussed —  regulatory relief, women in the work force, tax and trade, and infrastructure — with two to three people talking briefly about each subject to help shape  “how the administration should be thinking,” according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors said the CEOs would be mindful of Trump’s penchant for rebuking companies publicly.  “Given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the CEOs in that room and other CEOs will absolutely be mindful to avoid,” said Jim Russell, vice president at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending Friday’s meeting. “I’m sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully.” It was not clear if all 19 members of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Friday’s meeting. Other members include the CEOs of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N). Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Co (F.N) Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure. GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trump’s order “undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the U.S. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity  and company operations.”  The letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially-responsible investing like Calvert Research and Management and Domini Impact Investments. Others included representatives of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Companies that have been most critical of Trump’s immigration orders include Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

"Trump to nominate retired General Mattis for Pentagon WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday night he would nominate retired Marine Corps General James Mattis, known as “Mad Dog” and renowned for his tough talk and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, to lead the Pentagon. “We are going to appoint ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis as our secretary of defense,” Trump told a rally in Cincinnati. He said the formal announcement would be made on Monday. The choice of a seasoned military strategist would be another indication that Trump, a Republican, intends to steer U.S. foreign policy away from Democratic President Barack Obama’s increased reliance on U.S. allies to fight Islamist militants and to help deter Russian and Chinese aggression in Europe and Asia. Mattis is a revered figure in the Marine Corps and known for his distrust of Iran. The Washington Post and CNN reported earlier that Trump had chosen Mattis, but Trump spokesman Jason Miller said earlier on Twitter that “no decision has been made yet with regard to Secretary of Defense.” While the nomination of the 66-year-old Mattis would likely be popular among U.S. forces, it would have to clear a bureaucratic hurdle.   Because he retired only in 2013, Mattis would need the U.S. Congress to waive a requirement that a defense secretary be a civilian for at least seven years before taking the top job at the Pentagon. His impressive combat record, however, may deter some Senate Democrats from trying to block his nomination. Trump has described Mattis as “a true general’s general.”  The New York real estate magnate famously asserted last year: “I know more about ISIS than the generals do.” Mattis, whose past assignments include leading Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, is known for his colorful expressions that unashamedly embrace the job of the U.S. armed forces: fighting wars. In one famous line in 2003 attributed to Mattis, the general told Marines in Iraq: “Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.” In a 2016 question-and-answer session, Mattis appeared to be moved by a Marine’s question about how far out he could inflict casualties with his knife hand, known as a “kill-casualty radius.” “Once you get to be a high-ranking officer, the kill-casualty radius is whatever your Marines make it, and by the time I got up to the senior ranks it was hundreds of miles,” he said in a video for the Marine Corps. Still, such tough talk has gotten him in hot water. He was once rebuked for saying in 2005 that “it’s fun to shoot some people.”  His talk, however, belies a more thoughtful side. Mattis once said the most important 6 inches in a combat zone was “between your ears.” Now a fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, Mattis is also a scholar who was praised by then-U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2010 as one of the country’s great strategic thinkers.  Mattis reads avidly, frequently quotes history and is proud that he grew up with a large library and no television.  After meeting Mattis on Nov. 19, Trump described him as a strong, dignified man who persuasively argued against waterboarding, an interrogation tactic that involves pouring water over someone’s face to simulate drowning.  Trump had promised during the campaign he would not only revive use of waterboarding, which is widely regarded as torture and was banned under President Barack Obama, but bring back “a hell of a lot worse” if elected.  “(Mattis) said: ‘I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.’ And I was very impressed by that answer,” Trump told The New York Times. The Senate Armed Services Committee will consider Mattis’ nomination. In a statement on Thursday night, its chairman, Republican John McCain, called him “one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader.”  Mattis would be the first former U.S. general to become defense secretary since George C. Marshall took the job in 1950. The decision adds to Trump’s national security team another Pentagon veteran who served during the Obama administration but often had a testy relationship with it. Officials who knew him before he retired in 2013 said Mattis clashed with top administration officials when he headed Central Command over his desire to better prepare for potential threats from Iran and to win more resources for Afghanistan. Trump has given the job of national security adviser to Michael Flynn, a retired three-star Army general who was pushed out of the top job at the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 by Obama’s administration.  Flynn was fiercely critical of Obama during the 2016 campaign, adopting much of Trump’s rhetoric. Along with Flynn and Trump’s choice for CIA director, U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, Mattis has been critical of the deal to curb Iran’s suspected nuclear weapons program, saying the threat from Tehran should outrank more immediate concerns about Islamic State or al Qaeda. “The Iranian regime, in my mind, is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East,” Mattis said. Speaking about the Iranian nuclear deal, Mattis said: “Hoping that Iran is on the cusp of becoming a responsible, modern nation is a bridge too far.” If Mattis wins Senate confirmation, he will work side by side with another Marine - General Joseph Dunford, who is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Having two Marine generals in those top jobs would be highly unusual for a service that prides itself on being the most elite U.S. fighting force. It would also raise questions about how Mattis and Dunford might divide up tasks.  Both Dunford and Mattis share battlefield experience, including in Iraq. In 2003, Mattis led the 1st Marine Division during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. He has said one of the toughest things he had to do was oversee the retreat of his forces from the city of Falluja in 2004, something he feared would hurt morale, but did not. “We just don’t take refuge in self-pity or any of that kind of stuff. And so as a result, the Marine Corps remains a very feared organization in this world. As it should be,” he said. ",0
"Case on Trump worker contract raises conflict of interest question (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has often boasted about the strict confidentiality pledges he exacts from his employees.  Now a legal challenge to one of those agreements is pending before a U.S. agency over which he will soon have influence, potentially posing an early test of concerns about conflicts of interest between Trump’s public role and his business empire. In September, a worker-advocacy group filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claiming a nondisclosure contract used by Trump is unlawfully broad. The contract prohibits employees, independent contractors and even volunteers from ever disclosing any information that Trump deems confidential about his personal, business or political life. The NLRB has said that sweeping or unclear contracts inhibit workers from discussing working conditions or speaking to union organizers.  The five-member NLRB currently has two vacancies that Trump is slated to fill early in his term, likely tipping what has been a liberal-leaning agency under President Barack Obama to a more business-friendly posture. If the NLRB rules against Trump, it could free up workers to be more vocal about their concerns and strengthen their bargaining power. In addition to the confidentiality case, there are about 10 other Trump-related cases pending at the NLRB. The cases involve alleged labor violations at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, where management has refused to bargain with the Culinary Workers Union. It was not clear if the confidentiality contract was intended for workers on Trump’s election campaign or employees in his businesses, and Reuters could not independently verify its authenticity. Representatives of the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The case is at a very early stage and could be settled or dismissed before reaching a full hearing before the five-member NLRB. The board’s decisions may be appealed in a federal court. The NLRB is comprised of three members from the sitting president’s party and two from the opposing party, a system that typically results in wide policy shifts between administrations. In addition to the current two vacancies, another will arise when a current member’s term expires next December.  Under the Obama administration, the NLRB has struck down  confidentiality agreements and other employment contracts that could discourage workers from organizing at T-Mobile USA Inc, Quicken Loans, DirectTV and a number of other companies.  Government ethics experts and labor lawyers said that if Trump’s handpicked NLRB members uphold the contract, it could suggest favoritism.  “There is an appearance of bias and political pressure that could undermine the legitimacy of the agency,” said Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under Republican President George W. Bush. The NLRB cases represent one of several areas where concerns may arise over potential conflicts of interest raised by Trump’s new role and his sprawling business interests. Trump last week said he would allow his children to run his businesses while maintaining his ownership interest via a “blind trust.” If the current cases are ruled upon by the NLRB, one possible solution to the potential conflict could be for Trump appointees to recuse themselves from cases involving his business organization, said a former NLRB chairman, William Gould.  Gould said that during his tenure at the agency, in the mid-1990s, members recused themselves from cases that raised any chance of a conflict. Gould, who is now a professor at Stanford Law School, said he disqualified himself from cases involving a union of which his son was a member. Several experts, however, said recusal would not be legally required unless Trump’s appointees represented him or his companies in the past or were otherwise involved in his business. The challenge to Trump’s confidentiality agreement was filed by David Rosenfeld, a California labor lawyer, on behalf of the Committee to Preserve the Religious Right to Organize, a worker advocacy group that he created.  Reuters reviewed a copy of the employment agreement that Rosenfeld filed with his complaint, which targeted both the Trump Organization and the Trump campaign. Rosenfeld said he copied it from the campaign website, but that the agreement was no longer posted there.  It was not clear how many employees signed this version of the agreement, and Reuters was unable to find a copy on the website. The agreement prohibits disclosure of details about Trump’s “personal life, political affairs and/or business affairs,” as well as anything “Mr. Trump insists remain private or confidential.” It forbids employees from publicly disparaging Trump and his wife, children, grandchildren, siblings and other relatives. Confidentiality agreements are common, but labor law experts said they can be unlawful if they are too broad or don’t specify what types of information will be deemed confidential.  Trump defended a similar confidentiality agreement in a case earlier this year involving a former campaign aide, whom Trump accused of giving information about other staffers to reporters. In a statement, the Trump campaign said confidentiality agreements were “standard practice” for entities that need to safeguard sensitive information. The case settled for undisclosed terms.  ",0
"Moms march to demand end to police brutality, racial injustice Mothers whose children have been killed by police officers marched in Washington, D.C., on Saturday to call attention to police brutality and racial injustice.

The Million Moms March was sponsored by Mothers for Justice United, an organization of mothers whose children have been killed by police officers and others, and the Coalition for Justice. The march moved from the U.S. Capitol to the U.S. Department of Justice, where demonstrators demanded changes in police practices.

Maria Hamilton founded Mothers for Justice United and helped organize the march of mothers and their supporters. Hamilton's 31-year-old son, Dontre Hamilton, was shot 14 times and killed by a former Milwaukee police officer.

""This is a call for everybody to wake up,"" Hamilton said as the march began Saturday afternoon. ""We are here on behalf of our babies to tell the United States government that we aren't going anywhere. We aren't going to continue to keep burying our babies. Do something and do it now.""

Hamilton said as moms walked through the streets they aimed to honor ""stolen lives"" in solidarity. ""We will continue to lift our babies up,"" she said. ""They live through each and every one of us. They are gone physically but we have our own personal angels now.""

As demonstrators moved through the streets Saturday, some in the crowd shouted, ""No justice. No compromise,"" and ""Black lives matter.""

Many of the mothers and other protesters held photos of young men and women killed by law enforcement officers. Others clutched bright yellow balloons, flowers and held hands.

Mothers for Justice United, which also includes family members, clergy and concerned citizens, is focused on halting the killing of unarmed people of color by police and vigilantes through direct action, legislation and community building, the group says.

Marion Gray-Hopkins, whose 19-year-old son Gary was killed by a police officer in Maryland in 1999, told NBC News she planned to participate.

""Enough is enough,"" Gray-Hopkins told the network. ""We need to put about some changes in laws and practices that will stop the senseless killing of our unarmed children.""",0
"Details of first Putin-Trump meeting not yet settled: Kremlin MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and the United States are still discussing the timing of the first face-to-face encounter between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, expected to take place at a G20 summit in Germany later this week, a Kremlin aide said on Monday. Since Trump was elected U.S. president, Russian has been keenly anticipating his first meeting with Putin, hoping it would trigger a reset in U.S.-Russia relations that plunged to post-Cold War lows under Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama. But with Trump embroiled in a row at home over his associates’ links to Moscow, the encounter with Putin has become a minefield. Too warm a meeting would allow Trump’s domestic opponents to accuse him of being a Kremlin stooge. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters the Trump-Putin meeting would happen on the sidelines of the G20 summit, in Hamburg, but it was not yet finalised how it would fit into the summit’s schedule. “We will be looking for certain breaks, windows to hold this, the most important, meeting,” Ushakov said. “We have a lot of issues, which should be discussed at the highest level ... That’s why this meeting, this first personal contact, is so important.” Asked about the agenda for the meeting, Ushakov said: “I’ve heard the Americans want to raise the issues of terrorism and Syria. It seems to me that would be pretty reasonable.” Ushakov said that ties between Russia and the United States were at “zero level.” The Kremlin aide urged the United States “to save us from the need to retaliate” against Washington for expelling Russian diplomats and seizing two Russian diplomatic compounds on U.S. soil, one in Maryland and the other on Long Island. Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of the 35 Russians in late December last year, seized the compounds, and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over what he said was their involvement in hacking political groups in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Russian has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Putin said at the time he would not retaliate immediately, in the expectation that relations would improve under Trump. With no thaw materializing yet, Russian officials have said this month that they may now have to take “symmetrical” steps in retaliation. ",0
"Judge orders search of new Clinton emails for release by September 13 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered the State Department on Thursday to release by Sept. 13 any emails it finds between Hillary Clinton and the White House from the week of the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, among the thousands of additional emails uncovered by federal investigators. The order came after the Federal Bureau of Investigation gave the department a disc earlier this month containing 14,900 emails to and from Clinton and other documents it said it had recovered that she did not return to the government. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has been criticized for using an unauthorized private email system run from a server in the basement of her home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, a decision she says was wrong and that she regrets. The issue has hung over her campaign for the White House and raised questions among voters about her trustworthiness.  Judge William Dimitrouleas of the U.S. District Court in southern Florida made his order in response to a request by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which is suing the State Department for Clinton-era records under freedom of information laws. Spokesmen for Clinton did not respond to requests for comment. At least one other judge has said the department will eventually have to release all the newly recovered work emails, and at least some are expected to appear before the Nov. 8 presidential election. After the system’s existence became more widely known, Clinton returned what she said were all her work emails to the State Department in 2014, and the department released them in batches to the public, some 30,000 in all. The FBI took her server in 2015 after it was discovered she had sent and received classified government secrets through the system, which the government bans.  Clinton has said she did not know the information was classified at the time. After a year-long investigation, FBI Director James Comey said last month that Clinton should have recognized the sensitivity of the information and that she had been “extremely careless” with government secrets. But he said there were not enough grounds for a prosecution, a decision criticized by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and other Republicans. It remained unclear if there were any newly discovered emails that related to the September 2012 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed. “Using broad search terms, we have identified a number of documents potentially responsive to a Benghazi-related request,” Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. “At this time, we have not confirmed that the documents are, in fact, responsive. We also have not determined if they involve Secretary Clinton.” ",0
"Rice aides, Powell got classified info on personal email accounts WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and aides to his successor, Condoleezza Rice, both received classified information a handful of times via personal email accounts, the top Democrat on a congressional oversight panel said on Thursday. The findings come after nearly a year of controversy over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s decision to set up a private email server for her work as secretary of state. Democratic lawmakers and staff on Clinton’s presidential campaign seized on the report as vindicating some of their defenses of the controversial arrangement. Representative Elijah Cummings said the disclosures about Powell’s and Rice’s aides’ emails were made by the State Department’s inspector general, who is reviewing the email practices of the last five secretaries of state. That office told the State Department on Wednesday that it found 12 emails containing classified information sent to Rice’s aides or Powell, according to Cummings, who is the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Oversight Committee. In a statement, Powell said the two emails he received were not judged to contain confidential information at the time they were sent to him by American ambassadors. “I wish they would release them,” Powell told NBC News, “so that a normal, air-breathing mammal would look at them and say, ‘What’s the issue?’” A representative for Rice, who, as with Powell, served under Republican President George W. Bush, said the 10 emails sent to her aides did not contain intelligence information.  More than 1,500 of Clinton’s emails, which are being made public on a federal judge’s order, have been found to include classified information so far, according to the State Department. Clinton both sent and received information the State Department now deems to be classified, including the privately shared thoughts of foreign leaders, as well as highly classified U.S. intelligence agency secrets. It became public last March that Clinton set up a private email server in her New York home for her work as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. Accusations that she exposed government secrets to hackers and tried to side-step record keeping laws have since dogged her campaign, and the arrangement is being examined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Clinton’s campaign staff suggested the findings announced on Thursday helped vindicate her claim that she did nothing wrong or unusual and repeated their accusation that the State Department is overclassifying her emails, an idea the department has dismissed. “Hillary Clinton agrees with her predecessor that his emails, like hers, are being inappropriately subjected to over-classification,” John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, said in a statement, calling for their unredacted release. J. William Leonard, who oversaw the government’s classification regime as the Information Security Oversight Office director until 2008, said so-called “spillage” of classified information into unsecured email systems was common. “That’s why from the get-go it was exceedingly poor judgment to set up a private email account because of this very real fact,” Leonard said in an interview, referring to Clinton’s arrangement. The government forbids sending classified information via email, but the .gov email system, which Clinton circumvented, is monitored and protected on the assumption that classified information spills into it. Powell has said the State Department was technologically backward when he joined in 2001 and that he had to fight to get an Internet-connected computer installed in his office, from which he continued to use his personal email account. Georgia Godfrey, Rice’s chief of staff at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, said Rice did not use email while at the State Department, and that the 10 emails to her staff were reports on “diplomatic conversations.” Government regulations require that information shared in confidence by foreign government officials should be treated as classified.

"Obama scolds Senate Republicans for Supreme Court threat RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday vowed to pick an indisputably qualified nominee for the Supreme Court and chided Republicans who control the U.S. Senate for threatening to block him from filling the pivotal vacancy. Obama told senators he has a constitutional duty to nominate a new justice after Saturday’s death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and reminded them of their constitutional obligation to “do their job” and vote to approve or reject his nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the seat on the nation’s highest court should remain vacant until Obama’s successor takes office in January so voters can have a say on the selection when they cast ballots in the Nov. 8 presidential election. “I’m amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there,” Obama said. “The Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now,” Obama, a former constitutional law professor, told a news conference at the close of a two-day meeting with leaders from Southeast Asia. In Washington, Scalia’s chair in the court’s ornate chamber was draped with black wool crepe in accordance with court tradition following a justice’s death. The court said Scalia’s body will lie in repose at the Supreme Court building on Friday before his funeral Mass at the  Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington on Saturday. Obama’s nominee could shift the balance of power on the court, which had five conservatives and four liberals before Scalia’s death. The president said he understood the high stakes for Republican senators under pressure to vote against his pick for the lifetime appointment, who conceivably would be the deciding vote in cases where the court is split. Obama said the “venom and rancor in Washington” has led to the Senate routinely blocking his nominations for lower courts and other posts but said the Supreme Court is too important to get trapped in political gridlock.  “It’s the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics,” he said. But Republicans have pointed out that Obama and members of his cabinet, who were then in the Senate, were not above trying to block the Supreme Court nomination of Justice Samuel Alito by then-President George W. Bush in 2006. “While he complained about filibusters today, he joined filibusters while in the Senate,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Asked about his record, Obama acknowledged Democrats have played politics with nominations, too, through what he described as “strategic decisions” that ultimately did not block the president’s nominee. “But what is also true is Justice Alito is on the bench right now,” Obama said. Obama shed little light on whom he would choose or how the White House will try to finesse his choice through Congress. “We’re going to find somebody who is an outstanding legal mind, somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law,” Obama said. “I’m going to present somebody who indisputably is qualified for the seat, and any fair-minded person, even somebody who disagrees with my politics, would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court,” he added. Asked directly if that meant he would choose a moderate candidate, Obama said, “No.” He said there was “more than enough time” for the Senate to hold hearings and vote on his nominee without the White House needing to resort to a procedure known as a recess appointment to get around the Senate when it is not in session. But he did not explicitly rule out a recess appointment. Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, whose panel weighs Supreme Court nominations, said on Tuesday he will wait until Obama names his pick to fill the vacancy before deciding whether to hold confirmation hearings. Grassley has offered mixed messages since Scalia’s death on how the Senate should proceed on the vacancy, alternating hardline views on blocking any nominee with comments not ruling out hearings.  “I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decisions” about confirmation hearings, Grassley said, according to Radio Iowa. “In other words, take it a step at a time.” ",0
"Protesters flood Barcelona demanding release of separatist leaders BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Catalan independence supporters clogged one of Barcelona s main avenues on Saturday to demand the release of separatist leaders held in prison for their roles in the region s banned drive to split from Spain. Wearing yellow ribbons on their lapels to signify support, they filled the length of the Avenue Marina that runs from the beach to Barcelona s iconic Sagrada Familia church, while the jailed leaders  families made speeches. Catalonia s two main grassroots independence groups called the march, under the slogan  Freedom for the political prisoners,  after their leaders were remanded in custody on charges of sedition last month. The protest is seen as a test of how the independence movement s support has fared since the Catalan government declared independence on Oct. 27, prompting Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to fire its members, dissolve the regional parliament and call new elections for December. An opinion poll this week showed that pro-independence parties would win the largest share of the vote, though a majority was not assured and question marks remain over ousted regional head Carles Puigdemont s leadership of the separatist cause.   Look at all the people here,  said 63-year-old Pep Morales.  The independence movement is still going strong.  Barcelona police said about 750,000 people had attended, many from across Catalonia. The protesters carried photos with the faces of those in prison, waved the red-and-yellow striped Catalan independence flag and shone lights from their phones. The Spanish High Court has jailed eight former Catalan government members, along with the leaders of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Omnium Cultural, while investigations continue. The High Court last week issued arrest warrants on charges of rebellion and sedition for Puigdemont, who flew to Brussels after being deposed, and four other former government members who went with him.  Your light reaches us in Brussels and illuminates the path we must keep following,  Puigdemont tweeted during the protest. On Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled to release on bail the Catalan parliament s speaker Carme Forcadell and four other lawmakers, who enabled the declaration of independence by overseeing a parliamentary vote. Another lawmaker was released without bail. Forcadell left jail on Friday after agreeing to renounce any political activity that went against the Spanish constitution, in effect banning her from campaigning for independence in the December election. Those terms threaten to undermine the independence movement just as cracks are starting to appear and tensions rise between the grassroots and their leaders. Puigdemont s PDeCAT party has failed to agree on a united ticket to contest the election with another secessionist party, the ERC, denting the pro-independence camp s hopes of pressing ahead after the election. On Saturday, the ERC said its leader, jailed former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, would be its candidate in December and he would campaign from behind bars. Pepita Sole, a 61-year-old pensioner in the crowd on Saturday, said she understood the Oct. 27 declaration was symbolic but now wanted the real thing.  They better understand that we re not faking.

"Second prototype of China's C919 jet conducts test flight: state TV BEIJING (Reuters) - A second prototype of China s home-built C919 passenger jet took off for a test flight in Shanghai on Sunday, state television reported, another step forward in the country s ambitions to muscle in to the global jet market. A total of six prototypes will eventually conduct test flights, China Central Television reported, with engine tests to be a particular focus. The aim was to conduct another long-distance test flight in late January, chief engineer Wang Wei was quoted as saying. More than 1,000 tests would be carried out. The narrow-body aircraft, which will compete with Boeing s 737 and the Airbus A320, is a symbol of China s ambitions to penetrate the global passenger jet market, estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. The C919 made its maiden flight on May 5 after numerous delays. Analysts have questioned the long periods between previous test flights. It completed its first long-distance flight on Nov. 10, flying for 2 hours and 23 minutes from Shanghai to the central Chinese city of Xi an, covering more than 1,300 km (800 miles) and reaching an altitude of 7,800 meters (25,590 feet). Its manufacturer, the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], called the maiden flight a milestone that  marked the plane s move into an airworthiness certification phase. COMAC is aiming to obtain certification for the plane from Chinese regulators as well as Europe s aviation safety regulator, which agreed in April to start the certification process. The plane has dozens of customers who have placed orders and commitments for 785 jets, COMAC has said. ",0
"Malaysia says no decision yet on new offers to search for missing MH370 KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia said on Tuesday it has received proposals from three companies offering to continue the search for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which has been missing since 2014, but no decision has been made yet. MH370 vanished three years ago somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people aboard. Its disappearance has become one of the world s greatest aviation mysteries. Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said proposals were received from U.S.-based seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity, Dutch firm Fugro and an unidentified Malaysian company.  We wont be deciding anything now on whether we are embarking on a new search or not,  Liow told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Kuala Lumpur.  We have to discuss with the companies. It will take some time as it s some detailed discussions,  he said. Liow was commenting on media reports from Australia that said Malaysia could resume the search as early as this week. Australia, Malaysia and China called off a A$200 million ($159.16 million), two-year search for the plane in January, amid protests from families of those onboard. Liow said the proposals would eventually be presented to the other countries in the tripartite committee - China and Australia - before a decision was taken. Representatives for Ocean Infinity have said the company would only want to be paid if the aircraft was found. The Boeing 777 aircraft disappeared on March 8, 2014, and is thought to have been diverted thousands of miles off course out over the southern Indian Ocean before crashing off the coast of Western Australia.

"Trump says he has narrowed potential running mate picks to five or six: AP WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he had narrowed his potential vice presidential choices to five or six experienced politicians, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, told AP in an interview that he had not ruled out New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former rival now supporting Trump’s bid for the White House. “I have a list of people that I would like,” Trump was quoted as saying, adding he wanted his running mate to have political experience to help him “with legislation, getting things through” Washington if he wins the Nov. 8 presidential election. The New York billionaire businessman also said choosing someone who previously held elected office would make it easier to do background checks, in part because that person would have already been checked out by voters, the news media and to some extent, the government, according to the AP. “For the most part, they’ve been vetted over the last 20 years,” it quoted him as saying.  Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is heading up the vetting effort, a campaign aide said on Tuesday. The vetting group includes former rival Ben Carson and Trump himself, the AP quoted the billionaire businessman as saying. ",0
"U.S. Border Patrol Chief Morgan asked to leave agency WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan has been asked to step down as the agency moves toward tougher enforcement of immigration laws under the Trump administration, a Department of Homeland Security official told Reuters on Thursday. Morgan, a longtime former Federal Bureau of Investigation official, is expected to leave his post by the end of the month, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said.  President Donald Trump announced a broad plan to crack down on border security on Wednesday, including directing the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico.  The border patrol union, which endorsed Trump’s presidential campaign and applauded his executive orders, had been critical of Morgan for supporting former President Barack Obama’s plans to safeguard certain undocumented immigrants from deportation.  The executive board of the National Border Patrol Council called Morgan arrogant and a “disgrace to the Border Patrol” in an opinion piece published by conservative website Breitbart News on Nov. 30. Unlike many border patrol officers, Morgan did not climb the chain of command within the agency but spent most of his career with the FBI. Acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan issued a statement thanking Morgan for his service.  “On behalf of the men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Border Patrol, I want to thank Mark Morgan for his unwavering dedication to our border security mission, and recognize his life-long career in service to the nation,” the statement said.

"Minnesota lieutenant governor to replace Franken in Senate (Reuters) - Minnesota’s Democratic Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith was appointed as U.S. senator on Wednesday to replace Al Franken, who resigned after being accused of sexual harassment. Smith, 59, will serve a one-year term concluding in January 2019, Governor Mark Dayton said at a news conference, and will run in a special election for the seat in November next year. Dayton said he listened to the views of many Minnesotans before deciding on Smith. “There is no one I trust more to assume the responsibilities of this important office,” Dayton said. “I know that she will be a superb senator, representing the best interests of our state and our citizens.” Smith told reporters at the news conference that she will be a fierce advocate on behalf of the state, pushing for economic opportunity and fairness. “This is a difficult moment for us but even now I am now filled with optimism,” she said. “Though I never anticipated this moment, I am resolved to do everything I can to move Minnesota forward.”  Smith became lieutenant governor in January 2014. She previously worked as Dayton’s chief of staff and held positions at General Mills and Planned Parenthood. Last week Franken, 66, also a Democrat, announced his resignation from the seat he has held since 2009. The former comedian has denied some of the allegations against him and questioned others. Reuters has not independently verified the accusations against him. During Wednesday’s news conference, Smith thanked Franken for his service and called him a “champion” for the state. She said she respected his decision to resign. “Sexual harassment is disrespectful to people and can’t be tolerated,” Smith said. “I can promise you that I’ll be working on these issues when I get to Washington, D.C.” Smith will be an excellent senator, Franken said. “Her record of accomplishment as Lieutenant Governor demonstrates that she’ll be an effective senator who knows how to work across party lines to get things done for Minnesota,” Franken said in a statement on Wednesday. Minnesota will soon have two women senators, as Smith will join fellow Democrat Amy Klobuchar, 57, who in 2006 became the state’s first female elected senator and was re-elected in 2012. Minnesota’s first female senator, Muriel Humphrey, was appointed in 1978 to fill the seat of her husband, Hubert Humphrey, following his death. The Republican Party of Minnesota said Smith will be entering office with what it called the “political baggage” of the Dayton administration, as well as a “well-established track record of far-left policies.” “Minnesota Republicans look forward to electing a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 2018,” its chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan, said in a statement.  The Republican Party’s slim majority in the U.S. Senate will not be affected by the move to replace Franken. Democrats will gain a seat to cut Republican’s majority in the 100-member Senate to 51 after Tuesday night’s victory by Doug Jones over Republican candidate Roy Moore in a special election in Alabama.

"Obama to unveil U.S. Supreme Court nomination soon: Senator Reid WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is close to submitting to the U.S. Senate a Supreme Court nomination to fill the vacancy left by the Feb. 13 death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Wednesday. Reid, speaking on the Senate floor, said it was the chamber’s “duty” to perform a confirmation process on a nomination, “which we will have in a matter of a week or so.” Reid did not give any hints of who the nominee might be. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated that the Senate will ignore any Supreme Court nomination from Obama and will instead await a choice from whoever replaces Obama as president next January.

"Going Home to Falluja, a City Slipping Back Into Turmoil - The New York Times Times journalists are in Iraq’s Sunni heartland to evaluate rebuilding efforts after battles with the Islamic State. FALLUJA, Iraq  —   Iraqi forces had taken Falluja from the Islamic State months before, and Sabah Rashid was more than ready to return home. But the police warned him not to go. Fleeing Islamic State fighters had rigged bombs all through his south Falluja neighborhood, and these had still not been cleared, they told him. Insurgent corpses were said to lay unrecovered. Mr. Rashid, 30, a determined sort, moved back into his ransacked house anyway  —   he and his family fled the Islamic State three years ago and did not want to wait. Last week, they were camped out in their sagging house with no heat, electricity or running water. They boiled water on a wood fire. And they waited with mounting frustration for promised government aid. Nearly eight months after the recapture of Falluja showed that Iraq’s government could wrest one of the Islamic State’s major support bases away from it, the victory now seems at risk. The   national government has not yet demonstrated that it can secure and rebuild this shattered Sunni city, soothe sectarian grievances or provide for 250, 000 returning residents. Iraqi and American security officials now fear that if the Sunnis of Falluja are given no reason to trust the government, they may once again embrace the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. Local officials say Islamic State sleeper cells remain active, and many residents continue to aid the insurgents. Guerrilla attacks have resumed in one of the most recent episodes, a suicide car bomb on Jan. 28 killed two police officers. The seeds of an incomplete victory were there from the start. Falluja had long been disaffected from the government, and it was the first Iraqi city to fall under Islamic State control. Even with the group mostly driven out, the government faced a widespread lack of trust. Further, the battle relied heavily on Shiite militia forces, many of which are backed by Iran, and reports of sectarian abuses of the Sunni population started almost immediately. In one case, the governor of surrounding Anbar Province said that militia fighters and some of their allies in the security forces had summarily executed 49 Sunnis from Falluja and tortured others. The government tried to keep the militias out of Falluja to avoid antagonizing Sunni residents. But many entered the city dressed as policemen, Sunni lawmakers said. Local officials said Shiite militiamen were now confined to checkpoints on Falluja’s outskirts, about 40 miles west of Baghdad. “Of course, violations occurred in some places,” by Shiite militiamen, said Salam Ajmi, a Falluja municipal councilman. But now, he said, some Sunni residents were cooperating with security forces to help root out Islamic State sleeper cells. A visit to Falluja by Times journalists showed that last summer’s battle had left some sections of the city relatively unscathed, but had reduced others to rubble. Many streets were littered with crumpled buildings, collapsed roofs and   cars, all coated with gray dust. The skeleton of a crushed Humvee lay near Mr. Rashid’s home. For Mr. Rashid, the satisfaction of returning home was dimmed by resentment toward local Sunni officials charged with rebuilding the city. “We get nothing from them but promises  —   we are on our own,” he said as his two young sons fed dry grass to the campfire. The family members survive on food purchased at a newly opened market in a nearby district. Their own Al Alamin neighborhood offered only a bleak panorama of   homes and deserted streets. “Falluja has had some hard lessons  —   we hope this will be our last hard lesson,” said Sheikh Talib   the head of Falluja’s local council, who has promised returnees that help is on the way. Mr. Efan spoke in a cold, darkened room, within a building he said had been used as an Islamic State headquarters and was now the council’s makeshift office. The electricity sputtered on and off. Mr. Efan is a returnee himself. His three homes  —   one for each wife  —   were destroyed during the Islamic State occupation, he said. He has lived at a friend’s house since returning in August. “People have to expect delays,” he said. “They need to be patient. ” The United Nations Development Program said it had made stopgap repairs to the city’s main teaching hospital and to five schools and health centers. The agency has restored rudimentary electricity and water in many areas, cleared debris and hired 300 locals to clean streets. Lise Grande, the United Nations deputy special representative in Iraq, said the agency’s stabilization work was to help patch up Falluja until more permanent repairs could be made. The agency has spent $8. 6 million of $18. 5 million allocated  —   a small fraction of the amount needed to rebuild the city. Mr. Ajmi, the councilman, said the council had little funding. Depressed oil prices have kept Iraq’s economy floundering. Life is precarious everywhere, he said, not just in Falluja. Hussein Ahmed, 53, who lived in a   camp for three years, said he had lost patience with the council. He returned to Falluja to find his house wrecked  —   the third he has lost. Two previous homes were destroyed during battles against fighters for Al Qaeda in Iraq, he said. “We were hurt badly by Daesh,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “And now we’re being hurt by our own government. ” Mr. Ahmed pointed to an expanse of toppled buildings: “This area was liberated in June, and it still looks the same now. ” Other returning residents nodded as Mr. Ahmed added, “I speak for thousands of people when I say the government has forgotten us. ” Falluja has endured tragedy on an epic scale since 2003. The city was pounded during repeated battles  —   first between the United States and Saddam Hussein’s forces in 2003, then between American Marines and Al Qaeda fighters. Most insurgents were eventually evicted with the help of Sunni tribal fighters. But the insurgency was reborn as the Islamic State. It overran Falluja in December 2013, and the city became an important base for the group’s operations. One reason the government assaulted the city last May, even before turning to the critical campaign for Mosul, to the north, was to curb a devastating car bomb campaign against Baghdad that was being operated from Falluja. Now, the United States military is working with Iraqi forces to prevent Islamic State fighters from rising up in Falluja again, said a spokesman, Col. John L. Dorrian. “They have proved very resilient,” he said. Falluja is hardly the government’s only worry in a nation with 3. 1 million internally displaced people. The government is pouring resources into the Mosul battle while also trying to rebuild Falluja and Ramadi, in Anbar Province, and to repair the city of Tikrit, farther north. Of the 320, 000 people who fled Falluja for aid camps, about 250, 000 have returned since   the United Nations said. They are desperate to live at home again, whatever the risk. In south Falluja, First Lt. Walid Mohammed of the police shook his head as Mr. Rashid and his children tended their campfire. “We told them the risk is all theirs,” he said. “They are responsible if anything happens, not us. ” Elisabeth Koek, of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq, said about letting residents return to dangerous areas deprived of public services: “This is incredibly worrying. ” Mr. Rashid said he returned even after a   killed a returnee in a supposedly cleared area nearby. After Mr. Rashid moved in, a woman was killed by an explosion on Jan. 31 as she was repairing her home in the same area, police said. Mr. Rashid said he was accustomed to danger. He lifted his shirt to reveal jagged, crimson scars on his belly from an Islamic State bomb that he said blew up the family car in late 2013. The blackened front seat lay in the front yard. A tall,   man suddenly appeared: Mohammed Saeed, 49, a neighbor whom Mr. Rashid had not seen since 2013. Mr. Saed had returned that morning, three years after fleeing. His home was dirty and bereft of electricity or water. But he was moving in. Mr. Saed kissed Mr. Rashid on both cheeks. “I’m so happy,” he told him. “It’s a dangerous, terrible place, but we are home. ”",0
"‘Penis Seat’ Causes Double Takes on Mexico City Subway - The New York Times A seat in a subway car in Mexico City’s metro system caused a stir earlier this year. There were awkward glances. Visible discomfort. Baffled looks. Some laughs. And of course, the inevitable pictures from passengers’ camera phones. It was meant to be provocative, and it was. A seat was changed to look like the lower half of a male’s body, including the penis, part of a campaign by UN Women and the Mexico City government to raise awareness about sexual harassment on subways. On the floor beneath the seat, there was a sign reading, “It is annoying to travel this way, but not compared to the sexual violence women suffer in their daily commutes. ” The campaign has now released a video titled ”Experimento Asiento”  —   “an experiment with a seat”  —   that has had more than 800, 000 views on YouTube since March 20. It shows people reacting with a mixture of discomfort and shock throughout. One man even tried to cover the seat with a coat to sit on it. It didn’t work. He abandoned the seat, as did others who tried to sit in it during the experiment in January. UN Women and the Mexican government collaborated on a second video as well, which has also begun picking up traffic. It is called “Experimento Pantallas”  —   or “experiment screens. ” That experiment involved installing cameras that would take tight shots of male buttocks and display them on screens for all to see. In the video, a number of men are shown expressing disgust and embarrassment. “We wanted to do something different,” said a Yeliz Osman, a program coordinator with the Mexican UN Women office. “We wanted to target men because on a global level, the majority of programs talking about sexual violence or sexual harassment always target women and girls. We wanted to change that because we don’t think that women are the problem. ” The campaign is called #NoEsDeHombres (a rough translation would be “this isn’t manly”) and it is aimed at men, both with the video ads and with newly unveiled print ones that show guys giving lascivious looks with slogans like “this is how your mother gets looked at every day. ” These particular ads came about after UN Women and the Mexican government took open submissions for ideas on a campaign to target a male audience. Around 40 agencies submitted pitches and J. Walter Thompson won.  “We need to make clear that this is violent, not flattering, and incentivize men to intervene if they witness it” said Ana Güemez, director of the Mexican UN Women office, during the presentation of the campaign this Thursday. According to a national survey done in 2016 by the Mexican Institute of Women, Inmujeres, nine out of 10 women or girls who use public transportation feel unsafe while doing it. A   Reuters survey done in 2014 also showed that the Mexico City transport system is the   dangerous for women overall out of 15 world capitals. However, Mexico City was squarely in first place for specific questions like “have your been verbally harassed?” or “have you been groped?“ “In order to generate change, you need to create empathy,” Ms. Osman said. “The idea is that men can get a sense of what it is all like. By creating empathy, we hope that this might change their behavior. ” The Mexico City government has begun to take action: It is now possible to file an administrative complaint if you get catcalled (the perpetrator either pays a fine or spends a night in jail) and last year it started handing out rape whistles on the subway so that women could “warn of possible crimes” (a plan that was not without its critics). The issue has gained prominence in the past few weeks after a   blogger, Tamara de Anda, was publicly criticized for talking about filing a complaint against a taxi driver who accosted her verbally while she was walking down the street. Insults on social media ranged from telling her she wasn’t attractive enough to be offended by the driver’s catcall to issuing death threats. Ms. De Anda was one of several Mexican public figures who participated in the presentation of the #NoEsDeHombres campaign, alongside the wrestler El Hijo del Santo and the actor Alfonso Herrera, familiar to United States audiences from Netflix’s show, “Sense8. ”",0
"Illinois gets June 20 deadline to boost Medicaid funding CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois must increase payments to Medicaid providers despite an ongoing budget impasse, after a U.S. District Court judge on Wednesday ruled the minimal payments made by the state do not comply with federal consent decrees.  Judge Joan Lefkow ordered renewed negotiations between Illinois and health care advocates for the poor, setting a June 20 deadline to be in “substantial compliance” with the decrees.     Lawyers representing the state’s 3 million Medicaid recipients had asked the judge to give precedence to payments to managed care organizations participating in the state and federal health care program for the poor and disabled over the state fully funding other priorities, including debt service on bonds and pensions.  Lefkow said Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who pays the state’s bills, has not offered a “lawful basis” for not paying the Medicaid providers the $2 billion they are owed. “Although the court means no disrespect to the comptroller, who faces an unenviable situation, it finds that minimally funding the obligations of the decrees while fully funding other obligations fails to comply not only with the consent decrees, but also with this court’s previous orders,” the judge’s latest order stated. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois’ credit ratings from S&P and Moody’s Investors Service to a step above junk. As a result of the stalemate, Illinois’ backlog of unpaid bills reached $14.9 billion this week.  Mendoza said the real solution is enacting a budget.  “The lack of a budget for the last two years has created a situation in which we now have more court-ordered and state-mandated payments than we have revenues to cover them,” she said in a statement. Tom Yates, executive director of the Legal Council for Health Justice, who is representing Medicaid recipients in court, said more money is being sought at this time to ensure access to medical care, not an immediate payment in full. “I think the talks will have little different tenor now because the judge makes it pretty clear she expects more money to flow to Medicaid providers,” he said.  The consent decrees, which require the state to continue to make Medicaid payments despite its budget problems, stem from two 1992 cases.  ",0
"Obama passes baton to Clinton, stirs up '3rd term' charges President Obama invoked his “Yes we can” 2008 campaign slogan Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention, leaving little doubt that his declaration that Hillary Clinton was “fit” and “ready” to be commander-in-chief was a baton-passing of his eight years in office — a legacy that Republican nominee Donald Trump immediately attacked as “Owning the 3rd Term.”

Capping another night of Trump bashing — briefly interrupted by the official nomination of Tim Kaine to be Clinton’s vice presidential running mate — Obama declared, “There has never been a man or a woman – not me, not Bill, nobody – more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America,” at the same time accusing Trump of peddling ""fear"" and a pessimistic vision of the country.

‎Republicans immediately fired back, with party Chairman Reince Priebus issuing a statement saying, “Tonight reinforced that the Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine ticket is nothing more than two career DC insiders who want nothing more than to continue the failed Democrat status quo.”

He pointed to what he called the president’s “failed legacy in the Middle East” and said, “Our country cannot afford four more years like the last eight, which have left us less prosperous, less safe, and less free.”

Without question, the sitting president depends on his former secretary of state to help preserve his legacy, and fend off recurring Republican attempts to repeal ObamaCare, upend environmental regulations and more. But Republicans point to the other side of the picture – a debt nearing $20 trillion, tensions growing in America’s cities and an Islamic State threat that even top security officials suggest is growing in its reach and unpredictability.

“Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair,” Trump tweeted Wednesday night.

Obama, though, tried to frame the election as a choice between pessimism and optimism, as he set the stage for Clinton to accept the nomination Thursday night.

“America is already great. America is already strong,” Obama said. “And I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.”

Clinton surprised the crowd by showing up onstage with Obama at the end of his speech, the two of them hugging and waving to delegates who were holding up ""thank you"" signs.

Obama’s address was delivered shortly after delegates finalized the party’s 2016 ticket. In an overwhelming voice vote, they nominated Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine for vice president.

Kaine himself, after starting off talking family and faith, shifted gears in the second half and shelved his nice-guy persona to deliver a broadside against Trump, as he accepted the VP nomination from his party.

“Hillary has a passion for kids and families. … Donald Trump has a passion too: It's himself,” Kaine said. The senator was merciless after that. He went on to mock Trump, imitating his Queens accent when he says, “Believe me.”

“We're gonna destroy ISIS so fast -- believe me! There's nothing suspicious in my tax returns -- believe me!” Kaine bellowed, as the crowd roared with laughter. “Here's the thing. Most people, when they run for president, they don't just say ‘believe me.’ They respect you enough to tell you how they will get things done. … You cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth.”

While he was speaking, the Trump campaign was firing out press releases ripping Kaine as a “job killer” and part of the Washington establishment.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had considered an independent presidential run before ruling it out, made a late appearance Wednesday – with an endorsement that could help Clinton reach out to vital independents whom Trump also is courting, and a bagful of zingers aimed squarely at his fellow billionaire.

“Trump says he wants to run the nation like he’s run his business. God help us!” Bloomberg said, calling him a “dangerous demagogue” and claiming it’s “imperative” to elect Clinton.

The focus of the third convention night was heavy on gun control, global warming and even national security, an issue largely absent from the first two nights.

Together, the speakers Wednesday set the stage for Clinton to deliver her nomination acceptance speech and close out the convention Thursday night, after becoming Tuesday the first woman in U.S. history nominated for president by a major party.",0
"As French Election Nears, Le Pen Targets Voters Her Party Once Repelled - The New York Times    France  —   The National Front’s leafleteers are no longer spat upon. Its local candidate’s headquarters sit defiantly in a fraying Muslim neighborhood. And last week, Marine Le Pen, the party’s leader, packed thousands into a steamy meeting hall nearby for a pugnacious speech mocking “the system” and vowing victory in this spring’s French presidential election. “There’s been a real evolution,” Philippe   the retired head of a small manufacturing company, said as he handed out National Front leaflets in the market on a recent day. “A few years ago, they would insult us. It’s changed. ” It has long been accepted wisdom that Ms. Le Pen and her   party can make it through the first round of the presidential voting on April 23, when she and four other major candidates will be on the ballot, but that she will never capture the majority needed to win in a runoff in May. But a visit to this southeastern National Front stronghold suggests that Ms. Le Pen may be succeeding in broadening her appeal to the point where a victory is more plausible, even if the odds are still stacked against her. With a month to go, the signs are mixed. Many voters, particularly affluent ones, at markets here and farther up the coast betray a traditional distaste for the   party. Yet others once repelled by a party with a heritage rooted in France’s darkest political traditions  —     xenophobia and a penchant for the fist  —   are considering it. “I’ve said several times I would do it, but I’ve never had the courage,” Christian Pignol, a vendor of plants and vegetables at the Bandol market, said about voting for the National Front. “This time may be the good one. ” “It’s the fear of the unknown,” he continued, as several fellow vendors nodded. “People would like to try it, but they are afraid. But maybe it’s the solution. We’ve tried everything for 30, 40 years. We’d like to try it, but we’re also afraid. ” French politics are particularly volatile this election season. Traditional power centers  —   the governing Socialists and the   Republicans  —   are in turmoil. Ms. Le Pen’s chief rival, Emmanuel Macron, is a youthful and untested politician running at the head of a new party. Those uncertainties  —   and a nagging sense that mainstream parties have failed to offer solutions to France’s economic anemia  —   have left the National Front better positioned than at any time in its   history. But if it is to win nationally, the party must do much better than even the 49 percent support it won in this conservative Var department, home to three National Front mayors, in elections in 2015. More critically, it must turn   areas of the country in Ms. Le Pen’s favor and attract new kinds of voters  —   professionals and the upper and middle classes. Political analysts are skeptical. Frédéric Boccaletti, the party’s leader in the Var, knows exactly what needs to be done. Last week, he and his fellow National Front activists gathered for an evening planning session in La    a   port town devastated by the closing of   naval shipyards nearly 20 years ago. Mr. Boccaletti, who is running for Parliament, keeps his headquarters here. “I’m telling you, you’ve got to go to the difficult neighborhoods  —   it’s not what you think,” Mr. Boccaletti told them, laughing slyly. “Our work has got to be in the areas that have resisted us most”  —   meaning the coast’s more affluent areas. It is not unlike the strategy that President Trump applied in the United States by campaigning in   Democratic strongholds in   Ohio. No one thought he stood a chance there. Yet he won. “Now, we’ve got doctors, lawyers, the liberal professions with us,” Mr. Boccaletti said. “Since the election of Marine” to the party’s presidency in 2011, “it’s all changed. ” Yes and no. Since then, to broaden the party’s appeal, Ms. Le Pen has worked to buff the National Front’s image and distance it from its founder,   Le Pen, her disavowed   father, even kicking him out of the party in 2015. That strategy has helped make the National Front potentially palatable to some voters who had hesitated before. In the early days, four decades ago, winning 10 percent of the vote was considered a triumph for the party. This year, some polls predict Ms. Le Pen will get as much as 45 percent of the vote.   of her own edge toward the mainstream, Ms. Le Pen now buries her most incendiary proclamations. At a rally in nearby   last week, she pledged to cut taxes and “drastically” reduce immigration  —   well inside generic political formulations. Also last week, the party dismissed an official in the region for Holocaust denial. Still, Ms. Le Pen often emits the dog whistles easily recognized by her cheering crowds, as in a recent speech at Nantes, where she denounced in quick succession “the Rothschild bank,” and the   media and telecom magnate Patrick Drahi, a   businessman with French and Israeli citizenship. Ms. Le Pen and her party still show little compunction over using tried and true National Front strategies that stoke racial fears. A wall at Mr. Boccaletti’s tiny party headquarters here is adorned with a poster showing a hand tearing down a star and crescent, a symbol of Islam, with the slogan “Here, We Are in France. ” Another poster showed a veiled Muslim woman accompanied by the words “No to Islamism. ” When the beaming Ms. Le Pen clambers onstage at her rallies, menacing chords give way to triumphant brassy blasts. At the more elaborate rallies, Wagnerian electric flame throwers dramatically cap her closing vows to “renew the ties of national solidarity. ” In   it was Ms. Le Pen’s thrusts against the “mass immigration” and its supposed link to France’s mass unemployment that drew the loudest roars. “This is our country!” the crowd chanted. “She’s going to send home the immigrants,” said Jean Simon, a grizzled construction worker from Nice, who attended. “There’s way too much unemployment. ” Lashing the two issues together is a ploy straight from a playbook that dates to the National Front’s original doctrine in 1972. It is part of legacy that continues to give a good many French people pause. Some 58 percent of them still consider the Front a “danger” for democracy, according to a poll published in Le Monde this month, 11 percentage points more than in 2013. Yet there is enough uncertainty over whether Ms. Pen has sufficiently softened up traditional resistance that, for the first time, the candidate of a party still considered extremist by many has become the person to beat. The mainstream media is in near hysteria. Last week’s cover headline in the Journal du Dimanche warned of the “Le Pen Menace. ” The cover of this week’s L’Obs predicted in bold type: “If Le Pen is elected: The Black Scenario. ” In L’Express it was “Why Le Pen is advancing  —   again. ” Ms. Le Pen is in the unusual position of seeming like a winner and a loser at the same time. She is a winner because every French poll predicts she will come out on top in the first round. Four major candidates will be competing against her that day  —   two on the left, one in the center and one on the right. None, alone, can beat her. But she is a loser because those same polls all say she will be defeated by a hefty margin in the second round of voting on May 7, whoever her opponent is. “I don’t think she will be elected president,” said Joël Gombin of the University of Picardy Jules Verne, one of France’s leading experts on the Front. “But it’s not impossible any longer. “And even if she’s not elected, there’s a strong possibility that French political life will be turned upside down, and the National Front will play a larger role,” he added. The ambiguous status of winner and loser gives her whole campaign  —   the tone of her voters, her activists, her top lieutenants and even Ms. Le Pen herself  —   an uncertain feel, as if all are floating a few feet above reality. Muriel Fiol, a local doctor who was helping Mr. Boccaletti run the meeting, predicted that the “glass ceiling was going to explode. ” “People don’t want this political class any more,” she said. But Mr. Boccaletti urged prudence. There was still some way to go, as attitudes of many locals showed. Even if buoyed by the feeling that Ms. Le Pen is a player for the first time, volunteers conceded that the going was “difficult,” as was sometimes shown by the reception at the colorful market in this fishing port of pastel houses on the Mediterranean. Certainly, not all were convinced that Ms. Le Pen had outrun the long shadow of her party’s ugly reputation. “Sure, I took their leaflet,” Bernard Cornet, a retired teacher, said, broadly grinning. “Only so that I could throw it into the trash straight away. ”",0
"South Korea says delay in military drills aimed only at ensuring peaceful Olympics SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean officials said on Wednesday a proposed delay in military drills with the United States was aimed at ensuring a peaceful 2018 Winter Olympics, not ending the North Korean missile crisis, as relations with China suffered new setbacks. South Korean President Moon Jae-in is seeking to soothe relations with North Korea, which is pursuing nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of U.N. sanctions, and with China, the North s lone major ally, before the Games begin in South Korea in February. China, which hosted years of on-again-off-again six-party talks to try to end the North Korea standoff, resumed some blocks on group tours to South Korea, industry sources said, and rebuked Seoul for firing warning shots at Chinese fishing boats   On Tuesday, Moon, who visited China last week, said he had proposed postponing major military drills with the United States until after the Games, a move his office said was designed to reassure athletes and spectators.  This is confined to our efforts to host a peaceful Olympics,  an official from the presidential Blue House said.   We are only talking about the exercises which are supposed to take place during the Olympics and Paralympics.  North Korea sees the regular joint exercises as preparation for war, while China is still angry about the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system, commonly known as THAAD, by South Korea, whose powerful radar it fears could see deep inside its territory. The South argues it needs THAAD to guard against the threat posed by North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, Japan and the United States. For a graphic on North Korea's missile launches, click tmsnrt.rs/2j2S5T3 The proposed delay in drills was discussed during a summit last week between Moon and Chinese President Xi Jinping, after the proposal had already been submitted to the Americans, the  Blue House official said. China and Russia have proposed a  freeze for freeze  arrangement under which North Korea would stop its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a halt to the exercises. However, the official denied the proposed delay had anything to do with the freeze idea. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in Ottawa on Tuesday he was unaware of any plans to  alter longstanding and scheduled and regular military exercises . North Korea has stepped up its missile and nuclear tests at an unprecedented rate this year, and any new provocation from the North would  inevitably have an impact  on the exercises, the Blue House official said.  It is a display of the president s strong message that North Korea must not conduct any provocation (during the Olympics),  the official told reporters. (For a graphic on North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, click tmsnrt.rs/2vXbj0S) Japan s Asahi newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing an unidentified person connected to South Korean intelligence, that North Korea was conducting biological experiments to test the possibility of loading anthrax-laden warheads on its intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Asahi report said the U.S. government was aware of the tests, which were meant to ascertain whether the anthrax bacteria could survive the high temperatures that occur during warheads  re-entry from space. Reuters was unable to verify the report independently. In a statement released by state media, North Korea s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called reports it was developing biological weapons  nonsense  designed to provoke nuclear war. The United States has given China a draft resolution for tougher U.N. sanctions on North Korea and is hoping for a quick vote on it by the U.N. Security Council, a Western diplomat said on Tuesday, however Beijing has yet to sign on. When asked about the U.S. resolution at a press briefing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying would only say that China always takes a responsible and constructive attitude towards Security Council talks on North Korea. The United States has also called on the Security Council to blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions on North Korea. Hua said China had received the proposal from the United States.   China has resumed at least some restrictions on group tours into the South, South Korea s inbound travel agency said. The restrictions were first in place last year as part of China s retaliation over THAAD deployment.  I was told from my boss this morning that our Chinese partners (based in Beijing and Shandong) said they won t send group tourists to South Korea as of January,  the official from Naeil Tour Agency told Reuters by phone.  One source in China said the reason for reinstating the ban was to rein in overly aggressive tour operators who had been rolling out package deals to South Korea too quickly in the eyes of authorities. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua told reporters she had not heard of a tourism ban, but she reiterated that Moon s visit to Beijing was successful and that China has an open attitude towards exchanges and cooperation in all areas.  Beijing has never officially confirmed restrictions on tourism. Three representatives at Beijing travel agencies told Reuters that they were not currently organising group tours to South Korea. One confirmed that the tourism administration had issued the notice, while a third said:  At the moment we have no group trips to South Korea.  A travel agency in the northern province of Shandong also said it could not organise group trips. Three others said they could, but with restrictions such as on the number of people. South Korea s coast guard said on Wednesday it had fired around 250 warning shots on Tuesday to chase away a fleet of 44 Chinese boats fortified with iron bars and steel mesh that were fishing illegally in South Korean waters.  The Chinese fishing boats sought to swarm around and collide with our patrol ship, ignoring the broadcast warnings,  the coast guard said in a statement.  China, which has in the past lodged diplomatic protests to South Korea over the use of force by its coast guard, expressed  serious concern  about the latest clash.

"Clinton, Sanders Democratic debate draws 5.6 million viewers: CNN NEW YORK (Reuters) - The latest 2016 presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders drew an audience of some 5.6 million TV viewers, CNN said on Friday, below other recent Democratic debates. Thursday’s debate, aired live from Brooklyn, saw front-runner Clinton and Bernie Sanders challenged each other’s judgment and experience ahead of Tuesday’s crucial nominating contest in New York. Clinton and Sanders attacked each other over Wall Street, gun control and other issues on Thursday in a series of exchanges that laid bare the mounting pressures on them both but seemed unlikely to change the dynamics of the race. CNN said Thursday’s debate ranked 7th among Democratic debates this presidential cycle. Audiences for Republican debates have generally been twice as high as those for the Democratic contenders. ",0
"Dealmakers say a Trump presidency would be bad for M&A (Reuters) - A Donald Trump presidency would be bad for corporate dealmaking, according to a global survey of people who advise companies on mergers and acquisitions, or M&A. Nearly two-thirds of 1,500 respondents - including investment bankers, lawyers and people who work for private equity firms - said a Trump presidency would create uncertainty that would deter executives from launching bids. The survey was conducted in April by Intralinks Holdings Inc IL.N, which provides confidential meeting rooms used by companies when they allow would-be bidders to look through their accounts. “The real story is that dealmakers crave less disruption, and Trump has been a polarizing figure on a global scale,” Matt Porzio, vice president of strategy at Intralinks, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. His unpredictable style and fiery rhetoric have some investors worried that as president he could trigger trade wars, hurt the economy and add a lot of volatility to financial markets. The New York real estate developer prides himself on his ability to make good deals, and M&A professionals in the United States were less concerned about his impact on business than their peers elsewhere. According to the survey, 46 percent of U.S. dealmakers said they believed Trump would have a negative impact on M&A activity, compared with 83 percent of dealmakers in Latin America. Trump has sparked controversy with his call for building a wall along the Mexican border and for deporting 11 million illegal immigrants from the United States. Some 71 percent of dealmakers based in Europe and 75 percent in Asia thought Trump would be bad for business. Globally, only 45 percent of respondents thought that U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described socialist who is competing with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, would be bad for M&A activity. But the same proportion - 45 percent - thought Clinton would have a positive impact on mergers and acquisitions, making her the candidate viewed to have the highest positive impact on corporate tie-ups.

"What you need to know about the New Hampshire primary Voting started in the wee hours of Tuesday in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.

In Dixville Notch, residents did their traditional first voting just after midnight, bringing smiles to the faces of Bernie Sanders and John Kasich.

Sanders swept Hillary Clinton in Dixville Notch, 4-0, while Kasich topped Donald Trump, 3 votes to 2.

In nearby Millsfield, Ted Cruz won the Republican vote over Trump, 9-3. Several other candidates got one vote apiece. Clinton beat Sanders, 2 votes to 1.

In Hart’s Location, population 43, Kasich bested Trump again, 5 votes to 4, with Chris Christie gathering 2 votes. Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, and Marco Rubio got one vote each. Sanders edged Clinton, 12 votes to 7. Mark Stewart Greenstein, who calls himself a “liberty-leaning Democrat,” got 2 votes, the Union Leader reported.

But the real deal starts as polls across the state open later Tuesday morning, and New Hampshire has a record of making history in its primaries. Here's what to watch for:

Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have both been leading in the New Hampshire polls by double-digit margins for months. They both crushed it in a statewide poll of 11,000 K-12 students in the state last week. If either one of them loses the New Hampshire primary, it will be the equivalent of a political earthquake. So the real eyes are on the second-place finishers, and in the Republican race, perhaps third. On the Democratic side, if Hillary Clinton can get Sanders' margin of victory down below 10%, she can claim some success in challenging Sanders on his home turf (he's from neighboring Vermont). On the Republican side, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Jeb Bush have all averaged between 10% and 15% in the polls. If one of them can break away from the pack and finish more than 5% (or so) ahead of the rest of the field, it will give them the opportunity to claim to be the standard-bearer for the ""Not Trump"" lane of the party.

If Sanders and Trump do not win by large margins, prepare for a bunch of hand-wringing from pollsters, who are already under fire for unanimously failing to predict Ted Cruz's Iowa victory last week. There are a lot of good reasons to be skeptical of the polls — there are a lot of candidates in the GOP field so it is hard to narrow down the level of support among them; New Hampshire voters notoriously make their decisions late in the race; and it can be very difficult to predict turnout for non-traditional candidates like Trump and Sanders. (Here's a good podcast by pollsters Margie Omero and Kristen Anderson breaking down the Iowa polls.)  Still, for months polls have been the only real measure of who is up and who is down in the presidential race; those of us who cover politics for a living would feel better if the polls turned out to be right.

There are more registered independent voters in New Hampshire (390,000) than Democrats (231,000) and Republicans (262,000), and under state law any voter can walk into a polling pace and choose a primary ballot for any party. So independent voters will have a dramatic impact on the outcome, and watching how these voters align in New Hampshire might provide an interesting signal for which candidates could reach independents in November's general election.

The New Hampshire secretary of state is predicting more than 550,000 people will vote in the primaries Tuesday, which would be historically high and good news for ""outsider"" candidates Trump and Sanders who draw a lot of support from new voters. Keep in mind that new Hampshire allows out-of-state college students to declare residency in the state and vote there, which is also good news for Sanders, who is doing very well among young voters. Weather should not be a significant factor: It snowed in much of the state Monday and more snow is forecast for Tuesday, but not enough to keep these hearty New Englanders at home.

Most polls close in New Hampshire at 7 p.m. Eastern; the Iowa caucuses did not begin until 8 p.m. Eastern. So we should have meaningful results before the 11 p.m. news.

Results were not yet compete in Iowa before the first candidate — former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee — dropped out of the Republican race, followed quickly former senator Rick Santorum and Sen. Rand Paul, and, on the Democratic side, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley. Elections have results, and candidates who did poorly in Iowa like Kasich, Bush, Chris Christie, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina will have a hard time continuing their campaigns if New Hampshire gives them a second weak result.",0
Trump urges Congress to pass short-term spending bill WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called on the Republican Congress to pass a short-term government spending bill later on Thursday to avoid a shutdown when current funding expires at midnight on Friday. Republicans in the House of Representatives have unveiled a stopgap spending bill that would allow the government to stay open at current funding levels. “Pass the C.R. (continuing resolution) TODAY and keep our Government OPEN!” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.  ,0

"Gerry Adams to step down in end of an era for Irish nationalism DUBLIN (Reuters) - Sinn Fein s Gerry Adams, a pivotal figure in the political life of Ireland for almost 50 years, said on Saturday he will step down as party leader and complete a generational shift in the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Reviled by many as the face of the IRA during its campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland, Adams reinvented himself as a peacemaker in the troubled region and then as a populist opposition parliamentarian in the Irish Republic. Adams said he would be replaced as party president, a position he has held since 1983, at a party conference next year. He would also not stand for reelection to the Irish parliament.  Republicanism has never been stronger... But leadership means knowing when it is time for change. That time is now,  Adams said in an emotional speech to a packed party conference.  I have complete confidence in the next generation of leaders,  he said.  Adams stayed on stage as the 2,500-strong crowd, some in tears, gave him a standing ovation and sang a traditional Irish song about the road home, followed by the national anthem.  Adams will almost certainly hand over to a successor with no direct involvement in the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, a prospect that would make Sinn Fein a more palatable coalition partner in the Irish Republic where it has never been in power. Deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald, an English literature graduate from Trinity College Dublin who has been at the forefront of a new breed of Sinn Fein politicians transforming the party s image, is the clear favourite to take over. That would mean the left-wing party being led on both sides of the Irish border by women in their 40s after Michelle O Neill succeeded Martin McGuinness as leader in Northern Ireland shortly before the former IRA commander s death in March. Adams, who will turn 70 next October, has always denied membership of the IRA but accusations from former IRA fighters that he was involved in its campaign of killings have dogged him throughout his career.  Adams was a key figure in the nationalist movement throughout the three decades of violence between Catholic militants seeking a united Ireland, mainly Protestant militants who wanted to maintain Northern Ireland s position as a part of Britain, and the British army.  3,600 died in the conflict, many at the hands of the IRA. As head of the political wing of the IRA during its bombing campaigns in 1980s Britain, Adams was a pariah and banned from speaking on British airwaves, forcing television stations to dub his voice with that of an actor. He and his party emerged from the political cold in October 1997 when he shook hands with Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair at their first meeting. A year later, he helped win sceptical elements in the IRA to the Good Friday peace deal, which largely ended the violence. Since the peace deal Adams and McGuinness turned Sinn Fein from a fringe party into the dominant Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland and the third largest party in south of the border. While its anti-austerity platform led to a six-fold increase in its number of seats in the Republic - 23 out of 158 -  suspicion of Sinn Fein s role in the Northern Ireland troubles still runs deep and the far larger ruling Fine Gael and or main opposition Fianna Fail have ruled out governing alongside them. Analysts say a change of leader could help open the way to Sinn Fein entering government in Dublin for the first time.   Under a new Sinn Fein leader I think anything is possible,  said David Farrell, politics professor at University College Dublin.  A new Sinn Fein leader will also take over responsibility for rescuing power-sharing devolved government in Northern Ireland and avoid a return to full direct rule from London for the first time in decade.  Power-sharing collapsed after Sinn Fein withdrew in January saying the Democratic Unionist Party was not treating it as an equal partner and a series of talks have failed to break the impasse. ",0
"Iowa’s Des Moines Register endorses Clinton, Rubio Killing Obama administration rules, dismantling Obamacare and pushing through tax reform are on the early to-do list.",0
"Fitton: Eric Holder and the California-DC Corruption Connection - Breitbart I’ve often observed that, when it comes to public policy, the Obama Justice Department has been a locus of evil.  And therefore it was concerning to see that the man who ran that Obama agency for years, the disgraced Eric Holder, has gotten himself a new,   gig. [On January 4 liberal California legislative leaders announced that they are using tax dollars to hire former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm to assist them in anticipated federal challenges to several state policies such as climate change and immigration.  Leftists controlling the Democratic Party are especially concerned that a new Trump administration might actually start enforcing the rule of law against California’s dangerous and unlawful sanctuary policies.  Evidently, Eric Holder will waste taxpayer funds defending this lawlessness.  In a statement, Kevin de Leon, California Senate President Pro Tempore, said, “With the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead. ” The California Attorney General, who represents the State’s interest in court, already has a budget of $190 million. In response, we have filed a records request with the California Legislature Joint Rules Committee seeking to examine legislative records regarding the state’s employment of former Obama U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.: All contracts between the California Legislature and former U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. or Covington and Burling. All communications between the California Legislature and former U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. or Covington and Burling about the Legislature’s retention of Holder   Covington and Burling. Holder was one of Obama’s   and most controversial Cabinet members. On June 28, 2012, he became the first U. S. Attorney General to be held in contempt of Congress on both civil and criminal grounds. The contempt charge came in connection with Holder’s refusal to turn over documents about his agency’s lies on Operation Fast and Furious, the Obama administration’s   scandal. JW exposed numerous outrages associated with this scandal. Under Holder the Justice Department dismissed its voting rights case against the New Black Panther Party. The Justice Department originally filed its lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party following an incident that took place outside of a Philadelphia polling station on November 4, 2008. According to multiple witnesses, members of the New Black Panthers blocked access to polling stations, harassed voters and hurled racial epithets. A video of the incident, showing a member of the New Black Panther Party brandishing a   baton weapon, was widely distributed on the Internet. JW exposed a number of Obama DOJ lies regarding the Black Panthers, which a federal judge validated in Judicial Watch v. United States Department of Justice (No. 1:  ). In 2013, the Obama Justice Department was caught spying on The Associated Press by collecting months’ worth of phone records of reporters and editors.  Fox News’ James Rosen was among those targeted by Holder’s Justice Department. Thanks in part to JW’s success in exposing his corruption, Holder was forced to resign from the Justice Department in 2015 and rejoin his old law firm of Covington  Burling. Our records request is designed to expose how California state legislators are wasting tax dollars to take care of another corrupt politician  —   Eric Holder  —   with the intention of deliberately resisting the rule of law on immigration and other matters. His record at the Clinton and Obama Justice Departments demonstrates a willingness to bend the law in order to protect his political patrons.",0
"U.N. Human Rights Office Has ’Concern’ over Burundi Youth Militia ’Rape Song’ - Breitbart The United Nations Human Rights Commission has expressed concerns about a video that captures members of a   youth militia in Burundi singing about raping their adversaries. [“Impregnate those opponents, so that they give birth to Imbonerakure,” says the troubling verse in the song.  The Imbonerakure are the youth wing of President Pierre Nkurunziza’s party (“youth” defined as “any party member age 35 or younger,” according to an NPR report on the group). Their name means “those who see far” in the Kurundi language. The opposition in Burundi has accused the Imbonerakure of militant violence, including dressing up as policemen to attack opposition demonstrators. Some of this violence has resulted in fatalities, as the militia has been known to use machetes and grenades in its attacks. The military has allegedly provided guns and explosives to the Imbonerakure. In rural Burundi, they are said to have more power than the military or police. Nkurunziza’s   party denies the most damaging allegations against the Imbonerakure or distances itself from the youth militia when it becomes politically inconvenient. The latter course seems to have been pursued here. At first, the   claimed the video showing the “rape song” was a fake filmed outside Burundi, but later it admitted the footage was authentic and said the song “does not conform to the morals or ideology” of the party. A spokesman for the U. N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told Voice of America the Imbonerakure are waging a campaign of terror across Burundi that includes “horrendous” acts of torture such as “people being burnt with hot knives, acid being poured over parts of their body, teeth broken with rifle butts,” and “attacks on sexual organs. ” “These grotesque rape chants by the young men of the Imbonerakure across several provinces across Burundi are deeply alarming  —   particularly because they confirm what we have been hearing from those who have fled Burundi about a campaign of fear and terror by this organized militia,” said spokesman Rupert Colville. He added that his office has received reports of at least eight large rallies that included songs and slogans promoting rape and violence, and that senior government officials were present at some of them. Burundi has been teetering on the edge of civil war for years. The previous civil war ended in 2005, after killing some 300, 000 people, with a peace plan that limited Nkurunziza to two terms in office. However, he ran for and won a third term, claiming that his first term in office was ordained by parliament instead of the popular vote, so it should not count against the constitutional term limit. Burundi’s constitutional court accepted this argument, but many citizens did not. His government has become increasingly repressive, especially after a failed coup attempt against him in 2015. Burundi is one of those nations where “insulting the president” is a crime punishable by jail time, even if the perpetrators are high school children. Much of the political violence in Burundi has an ethnic component, as the   is a party of the Hutu tribe, while many victims of oppression are members of the Tutsi minority, the same tribal conflict that turned Rwanda into a bloodbath. The U. N. High Commission for Human Rights chronicles numerous complaints of violence and the incitement to violence by   officials and the Imbonerakure militia, noting that “coded language” about raping adversaries or making them disappear is all too easy to decode in a nation only a few years removed from bloody civil war. “The Government needs to stop pretending that the Imbonerakure are nothing but a community development group,” said High Commissioner Zeid Ra’ad  . “Such blatant and brazen hate speech and incitement to violence must not be tolerated, nor encouraged. In a region which has suffered so many massive outbreaks of violence and atrocities, this type of organized incitement rings very loud alarm bells. ”",0
"Donald Trump Has Long Benefited From Trade Practices He Now Scorns - The New York Times Donald J. Trump vowed on Tuesday that as president, he would put an end to policies that send American jobs overseas, threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese imports and promising to punish companies that relocate their manufacturing to countries with cheaper labor. “It will be American hands that remake this country,” said Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, standing before a hunk of aluminum at a recycling plant in western Pennsylvania. But such declarations are at odds with Mr. Trump’s long history as a businessman, in which he has been heavily  —   and proudly  —   reliant on foreign labor in the name of putting profits, rather than America, first. From cheap neckties to television sets, Mr. Trump has benefited from some of the trade practices he now scorns. Besides construction, Mr. Trump is big in the clothing business. But most of his line of suits, ties and cuff links bear a “Made in China” label. Some also come from factories in Bangladesh, Mexico and Vietnam. He has blamed China’s currency manipulation to argue that it is almost impossible to find garments that are made domestically these days, or that they are prohibitively expensive. “The answer is very simple,” Mr. Trump told  ABC News when asked about his merchandise in 2011. “Because of the fact that China so manipulates their currency, it makes it almost impossible for American companies to compete. ” Despite that claim, some companies such as Brooks Brothers continue to make clothes in the United States. In 2013, Mr. Trump teamed with Dorya, a Turkish maker of luxury furniture, for his Trump Home brand. In a news release at the time, the Trump Organization promoted the craftsmanship of the pieces, which furnish some of Mr. Trump’s hotels. “The entire production process, from the moment the raw wood is cut until the product is finished or upholstered occurs in Dorya’s Izmir, Turkey, production facility,” the release said. Mr. Trump also invested in a line of crystal bearing his name to go with his Trump Home line. The collection was produced in Slovenia, the home of his wife, Melania. Mr. Trump told The New York Times in 2010 that the production facilities were first class. “I’ve seen factories over there their glass and crystal works are unbelievable,” he said. Mr. Trump has not held back when it comes to his concern that undocumented immigrants are taking jobs from American workers, but he has used them on occasion. In 1980, a contractor hired by Mr. Trump to demolish the Bonwit Teller building in New York and make way for Trump Tower used undocumented Polish immigrants who reportedly worked    and even slept at the site. Mr. Trump said that he did not know they were undocumented and later settled a lawsuit over the matter. Last summer, The Washington Post found that Mr. Trump was using undocumented immigrants for the construction of his Trump International Hotel at the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington. And The Times reported this year that Mr. Trump had employed hundreds of foreign guest workers from Romania and other countries at his    resort in Florida. Mr. Trump said that he found it difficult to find qualified local people to work there during the high season. While Mr. Trump has for years railed against trade and currency policies that he says are unfair, he has not always been opposed to outsourcing. Writing on the Trump University blog in 2005, Mr. Trump acknowledged that foreign labor was sometimes needed to keep American companies from going out of business. “If a company’s only means of survival is by farming jobs outside its walls, then sometimes it’s a necessary step,” Mr. Trump wrote. “The other option might be to close its doors for good. ” Mr. Trump usually makes the case that foreign labor is necessary to keep production costs down, but in an interview with David Letterman in 2012 he also offered a humanitarian argument for outsourcing. Teased for selling dress shirts that were made in Bangladesh, Mr. Trump expressed pride that he was creating jobs around the world. “That’s good, we employ people in Bangladesh,” Mr. Trump said. “They have to work, too. ”",0
"Trump vows tax plan to boost economy; poll cites views on wealthy HARRISBURG, Pa./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday told workers that they would win under his tax plan, saying it would help the middle class and boost the economy, though critics say it would mainly benefit corporations and the rich. Speaking in an airplane hangar at a Pennsylvania Air National Guard base in Harrisburg with a trailer truck behind him, Trump reiterated the basic points of the nine-page tax cut “framework” he unveiled two weeks ago. “It’s a middle-class bill. That’s what we’re thinking of.  That’s what I want,” Trump said. “I’ve had rich friends of mine come up to me, and say, ‘Donald, you’re doing this tax plan — we don’t want anything. ... Don’t give it to us. Give it to the middle class.’  And that’s what we’re trying so hard to do,” he said. His remarks came as new Reuters/Ipsos polling showed that more than three-quarters of Americans say the wealthiest Americans should pay more in taxes. The poll found 53 percent of adults “strongly agree” and 23 percent “somewhat agree” that the wealthiest Americans should pay higher tax rates. The Sept. 29-Oct. 5 poll of 1,504 people has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of plus or minus 6 percentage points. Financial markets have rallied strongly since Trump’s November 2016 election victory, driven partly by expectations that he would cut taxes for businesses, although policy analysts have been skeptical that he would do so. Trump on Wednesday boasted about the rally in markets. “The stock market is soaring to record levels, boosting pensions and retirement accounts for hard-working Americans.  Their values are going up every single day,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said he was a “little bit discouraged” about the prospects for federal tax reform. Given the difficulties Congress has had in passing laws  this year, Williams, in comments following a speech in Salt Lake City, said he is “losing confidence” that any tax reform will be passed in the next six months or so. Trump said his plan for cutting corporate taxes could boost wage growth and mean a $4,000 pay raise for the average household, citing research from a White House economic council. Democrats, who oppose Trump’s plan, dispute such claims. “I have not seen any evidence that even comes remotely close to that,” Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said of the $4,000 calculation at a forum on Wednesday in Washington. Independent analysts have said Trump’s blueprint would provide uneven tax relief, add significantly to the federal budget deficit, and in some cases, benefit the very wealthy. For instance, taxpayers in the highest 1 percent of incomes, making more than $730,000 annually, would get about half of the total benefit from Trump’s plan, with after-tax incomes rising an average of 8.5 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based nonprofit tax think tank. Trump on Wednesday said his framework would provide a $500 tax credit to “those who care for an adult dependent or elderly loved one” and that it would substantially increase the child tax credit. No details on those items have been made public. Congressional tax writers in the House and Senate are working to fill in the details of Trump’s framework. Republican leaders hope to pass a bill by January, delivering what would be Trump’s first legislative victory a year into his presidency. Before that can happen, the Senate and House must open a procedural path for tax legislation by passing a budget resolution. Lawmakers have hoped to do that this month. CORPORATE, PASS-THROUGH CUTS The tax framework, developed in secret by a select group of senior Republicans known as the Big Six, calls for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and creating a new category for pass-through income earned by partners and sole proprietors, which would be taxed at 25 percent, instead of the 39.6 percent top individual rate currently paid by some. It proposes cutting the top individual rate to 35 percent, but congressional tax writers may opt to create an additional, higher rate for the highest earners. The plan also proposes eliminating the 40 percent tax on inherited estate assets worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for a married couple. A highly placed Republican operative who used to work with senior leadership on Capitol Hill said he did not expect the estate tax repeal to be included in a final package, because the proposal would greatly benefit Trump himself and his family, which would leave the tax reform effort and Trump open to Democratic attack. He said many Republicans do not see estate tax repeal as crucial, but Republicans have promised wealthy supporters for years that the tax, which they call the “death tax,” will end. Trump on Wednesday offered a different view. Republicans will end “the crushing, horrible, and unfair estate tax,” he said. For graphic on top power brokers, click: here ",0
"Apple’s New MacBook Pro: Fast and Light, but Not for Everyone - The New York Times When Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro laptops at a media event last month, Adam Leventhal, a software engineer, was eager to learn about them. Yet by the time he finished watching a live stream of the event, Mr. Leventhal, who has owned only Mac computers for the last 30 years, was turned off. “With this one I was really disappointed,” he said. For a new laptop, the MacBook Pro has been divisive. That may partly be because the model, which has long been used by creative professionals and coders, has stayed largely the same since 2012. So this time, when Apple introduced some fairly radical changes, emotions among some longtime Mac customers ran high. In their latest incarnation, MacBook Pros have only one type of connection port, as opposed to the several types they had before. That will require people to buy adapters to plug in devices that use different types of connectors. On the keyboard, Apple also replaced the top row of physical keys, including the Escape key, with a virtual touch strip called the Touch Bar. The benefits? The new laptops are faster, much thinner and lighter than the previous generation, and they have about 10 hours of battery life. The Touch Bar’s virtual buttons transform depending on the app you are using, unlocking the potential for software makers to create custom shortcuts. I tested the new MacBook Pros  —   which cost $1, 500 to $2, 800, depending on the model  —   while gathering reactions to the new computers from engineers and information technology professionals over two weeks. I concluded that while the new laptops are capable enough for many professionals, there is no need to rush to buy one. Here are the highlights and lowlights of the new MacBook Pros: With the new laptops, Apple has gone all in on   the   USB port. This small,   connection is expected to replace the bulkier, rectangular port known as   on many computing devices and accessories in the next few years. In my tests, having only   on the MacBook Pros was the biggest change. The previous MacBook Pros included   and some other types of ports, including HDMI, for connecting devices like printers and monitors. Now the   ports will be the only way to hook up just about everything, including power chargers, external screens and   readers, to the laptop. The   MacBook Pro has two   ports, and the   models include four. What this means in the near term is that you may have to buy adapters to plug in devices with different connectors. Annoyingly, that includes the iPhone power cable, which has a   connector. So to charge an iPhone on a new MacBook Pro, for example, you have to hook up the cable to a dongle that connects   and   devices. The transition to   might be a headache, but it is easily resolved by picking up some inexpensive adapters. I bought mine from Monoprice. In the long run, Apple’s shift to   will help set an industry standard, said Brian Denslow, a technician for TechCollective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco. The goal is to reach a point where all peripheral devices are made with a   connector. So eventually you won’t need adapters. “We’re going to cut ties with the past and go with the new standard, finally,” Mr. Denslow said. With the Touch Bar, Apple intended to replace some outdated keys with a versatile strip that adapts to the apps you are using. Apple also built a fingerprint sensor into the Touch Bar. The Touch Bar is a breeze to get the hang of, but I didn’t find it helpful in streamlining tasks. If you open the Photos app, for example, the Touch Bar displays thumbnails of photos in your library, and you can tap one to select a photo to edit. That’s neat, but why not just select the photo on your laptop screen? When using the Safari browser, you can use the Touch Bar to select a different browser tab  —   but using keyboard shortcuts (Command+1 to choose the first tab, for instance) is quicker. The Escape key also exists as a virtual button on the Touch Bar. I didn’t mind that because I rarely use this key, but the design decision made Mr. Leventhal, the software engineer, wince. He said the physical Escape key was crucial for coders, and not being able to press it seemed crippling. The jury is still out on whether the Touch Bar will be a  . When switching back to a laptop with a normal keyboard, I didn’t feel as if I was missing anything. But much like the iPhone on Day 1, the Touch Bar is essentially a blank slate, and the onus is on app developers to make it more compelling. Many Apple loyalists have fixated on the memory constraints and underwhelming performance of the new MacBook Pros. The new models have a maximum of 16 gigabytes of RAM  —   the same limit as the previous MacBook Pro  —   and roughly the same processor speed as the last professional notebooks. But that’s not the full story. The new notebooks are much faster in some ways than older models, while other parts are only slightly faster. In speed tests run with the app Geekbench 4, the   MacBook Pro’s computer processor was only 10 percent to 17 percent faster than the   model released in 2012. Yet the graphics processor, which is crucial for heavy computing tasks, in the new MacBook Pro is about twice as fast as the one in the older model, and the storage drives are much faster, too. The RAM limit might irk users who need power. The more RAM you have, the more applications you can open and the more quickly your computer can juggle them. The problem, in theory, is that in a few years if your future apps hog more memory, you won’t be able to add more memory to MacBook Pros because the most they can hold is 16 gigabytes. Professional Mac users are too divided on the MacBook Pro for me to make a blanket recommendation. One thing is sure: For casual users or anyone buying their first laptop, who may just want a computer for web browsing and lightweight apps, the MacBook Pro is overkill. A Chromebook, like the $430 Chromebook 13 from Dell, or the $1, 000 MacBook Air, Apple’s least expensive notebook computer, are slower and have   screens, but they are powerful enough for your needs. The new MacBook Pros are probably powerful enough for most professionals. But if you consider yourself a power user and are skeptical about the MacBook Pro, you might wait to see whether the initial concerns are borne out after early adopters start using their machines. Plenty have already bought them: Apple said early orders for the new MacBook Pro have been stronger than for past professional notebooks. On the plus side, these notebooks are fast, with   screens and responsive keyboards. But the Touch Bar so far feels gimmicky, and not many devices or accessories come with   connectors yet. The MacBook Pros are also expensive, and some users may end up spending thousands of dollars above the retail price for   like extra storage. So if you aren’t ready to make the jump to   and you don’t want to spend a big chunk of your savings, it’s reasonable to wait for the new Apple notebooks to realize their potential or drop in price. Mr. Leventhal says he is exploring other options such as a Hackintosh  —   a generic PC that is modified to run the Mac operating system. “It’s a dark place where you’re doing something that is basically illegal and spending a ton of time to even make it feasible, but I have no good options,” he said.",0
"G.O.P. Hurries to Slash Oil and Gas Rules, Ending Industries’ 8-Year Wait - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   The document carried the title “A Roadmap to Repeal,” a concise list of Obama administration environmental regulations that a Koch   group was pressing President Trump and Congress to quickly reverse after Inauguration Day. It was a tally of rules that energy industry executives and lobbyists had waged a futile fight against for eight years, donating millions of dollars to lawmakers who vowed to help block them, filing lawsuits to try to overturn them and hiring experts to generate reports that questioned the need for them. But in a flurry of activity this past week, Congress did what Charles G. and David H. Koch  —   who own a conglomerate that sells hundreds of products, including gasoline, jet fuel and coal  —   and other industry leaders had been asking for. Using a rarely invoked law, the   Congress nullified a measure intended to curb the venting of gas wells on federal lands, and began the process of rolling back other regulations, including one enacted to limit damage that coal mines cause to streams  —   each items on the “Roadmap to Repeal. ” On Friday, with his own executive orders, Mr. Trump took up two more items on the list, including a call to rewrite major provisions of the   Act, legislation crafted by the Obama administration and passed by Congress in response to the 2008 financial meltdown. Not since the Reagan administration has Washington moved so quickly to roll back or nullify so many federal regulations, one of the clearest signs of an abrupt shift of power in a government now under   control that has flipped the script of winners and losers. “It is a big, fat victory, after all this time,” said Luke Popovich, a vice president at the National Mining Association, an industry trade group. A   alliance has now been formed among Congress, the Trump administration and industries that struggled to reverse what they saw as an    rush to regulate by the Obama administration. This new alignment of power is causing alarm among not only environmental groups but also other  —   mostly liberal  —   advocates who have spent much of the past eight years pushing for new rules to cover Wall Street banks, broadband providers, teacher preparation requirements, prepaid credit cards and even companies that sell   foods in vending machines. All of these measures, and many others, now stand a chance of being reversed, watered down or blocked. “For the last several years, whenever Congress would concoct some way to roll back a rule protecting clean air or clean water or undermine the fight against climate change, we always felt confident as we had an adult in charge at the White House,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental group. “Now, what used to be a wish list of the oil and coal and gas industry has become the   list for Congress and the White House. ” For Republicans, these first moves are the easy part, made possible by a law that gives Congress the power to reverse regulations within 60 legislative days with a simple majority vote in the House and Senate. Other Republican efforts to exploit this    law  —   which until this week had been used only once to nullify a new rule  —   were thwarted five times with vetoes by President Obama since 2015. Once the   window expires, Republicans will have a harder time reversing Mr. Obama’s regulations, but will still have tools at their disposal, including cutting financing for the enforcement of rules, issuing new rules that are weaker, or negotiating with Democrats to pass new legislation. They have bold ambitions, including rescinding a rule enacted by the Obama administration that could close dozens of coal burning power plants, and another that would extend overtime pay eligibility to an estimated four million Americans. At a private meeting on Thursday hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, a senior White House adviser provided a plan on how the administration would handle efforts to curtail environmental regulations beyond the initial rush now underway to nullify recently adopted rules, said an energy industry executive who participated in the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity because details were confidential. Industry advocates and their allies in Congress said the   moves toward deregulation was good for consumers and the economy, as they simply wanted to eliminate measures that they believed cost jobs and drove up prices. Among the regulations being targeted: the methane rule, an Interior Department measure meant to reduce   flaring, when gas leaking from wells is burned off like a giant blow torch. “Even on the way out the door, the former administration’s regulatory onslaught continued as they pushed through more midnight regulations,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said on Wednesday, as he urged his colleagues to reverse the coal mining regulation, known as the Stream Buffer Rule. “Fortunately, with a new president, we now have the opportunity to give the American people relief and our economy a boost. ” Lobbyists for the   extraction industry  —   oil, gas, coal and other mining operations  —   said they were as surprised as anyone else by the outcome of the November election, which gave them new clout in Washington. “A lot of us folks just did not anticipate we were going to be doing this,” said Stephen Brown, a lobbyist at Tesoro, an oil refining and marketing company based in San Antonio. “It was like the dog that caught up with the UPS truck. ” Within days of the election, conference calls and meetings between industry lobbyists, members of Mr. Trump’s transition teams and key Republican staff members on Capitol Hill were taking place. Those who took part began to plot out which regulations they wanted to go after first, participants in the process said. Energy rules quickly ended up at the top of the list. Mr. Obama was unusually aggressive in using his regulatory powers to expand the reach of the federal government over the energy industry, after failing to win the support he needed in Congress to pass legislation to take similar steps. But the energy industry spends about $300 million a year lobbying Congress, deploying an army of three lobbyists for each member. It also contributed more than $160 million during the most recent election cycle to federal candidates, with 80 percent of that going to Republicans, according to a tally by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group. And the industry now wanted congressional leaders like Mr. McConnell, who is from one of the country’s top   states, to nullify the Obama administration’s new rules. “This has been a   press to block these rules, from a legal standpoint, a policy standpoint and a political standpoint,” said Bret Sumner, an oil and gas industry lawyer, who serves on the board of the Western Energy Alliance, a trade group that has aggressively lobbied Congress to block Obama administration regulations governing drilling on federal lands. Mr. Sumner’s group, along with the American Petroleum Institute and other major industry trade associations and individual companies and the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, all pressed congressional leaders to immediately repeal the methane rule, which the Interior Department finalized in November. The measure, according to the department, would force companies to prevent the release of gas via flaring or leaks, eliminating an estimated 180, 000 tons a year of methane gas, a contributing factor in climate change, while also increasing federal revenue by as much as $10 million a year, as the energy companies pay royalties only on fuel they contain and then sell. For its part, the coal industry pushed Congress to reverse the Stream Buffer Rule, also drafted by the Interior Department, that prevented mining companies from cutting off mountaintops in search of coal and other commodities, then dumping the remaining debris into nearby valleys. The department predicted the rule would protect 6, 000 miles of streams and an estimated 52, 000 acres of forests over the coming two decades. “It did not take a big pitch,” said Hal Quinn, president of the National Mining Association, of his group’s lobbying effort targeting congressional leaders to get its measure on the repeal list. “We clearly reinforced the fact this is ripe and due for Congress to reassert its power. ” A third rule targeted for quick repeal was one adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that required oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments for development rights  —   a provision intended to prevent corruption in places like Africa and Latin America. Billions of dollars from such payments have disappeared over the past several decades, at times siphoned by government officials for their personal use, instead of being used to improve the standard of living in these often impoverished nations. Exxon Mobil, whose former chief executive, Rex Tillerson, just became secretary of state, was one of the provision’s primary opponents. He argued that the rule would force the company to disclose “commercially sensitive information” and make it harder to compete against certain foreign oil companies that do not need to comply. By Friday, both the House and Senate had approved the first two of these repeals  —   on the stream rule and the foreign government payments  —   and final action by the Senate approving the repeal of the methane gas rule is expected soon. Mr. Trump has already put out a memo welcoming the rule reversals by Congress. “The administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations imposed on America’s businesses,” said a statement issued by the White House on Wednesday. The push to repeal these rules has created moments of obvious frustration for Democrats on the floor of the House and Senate chambers. As the blitz began this past week, Democratic lawmakers used various props  —   like   photographs of fish harmed by mining industry practices  —   to try to make their points. Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, arrived on the chamber floor with a mock “Wheel of Fortune” board, with slivers marked “coal,” “mining” and “even more oil” indicating the available prizes that Congress was offering. “Let’s consult our wheel to see who is the big winner of the G. O. P. giveaway this week,” Mr. Markey said, essentially conceding that Senate Democrats were all but certain to lose many of these fights. But for Freedom Partners  —   the secretive club of hugely wealthy political donors led and organized by the Koch brothers  —   it was a week to celebrate, as there had been a great deal of progress on their “Roadmap to Repeal” list. James Davis, an executive vice president at the group, sent a message late on Friday declaring “these repeal bills will soon be on their way to President Trump for his signature. ”",0
"A Song for Bill de Blasio Sounds a Sour Note for Watchdogs - The New York Times Mayor Bill de Blasio posted a video on his City Hall Twitter account on Tuesday that featured two Broadway actors singing his praises and promoting his accomplishments, drawing criticism from government watchdog groups who said that it was an inappropriate use of public money and was too much like a campaign ad. The video, which tries to poke fun at itself even as it promotes the mayor, was posted on the official City Hall Twitter account, @NYCMayor, and features Mr. de Blasio in an awkward thespian effort. It also includes his wife, Chirlane McCray a senior adviser, Andrea Hagelgans and two Broadway stars, Jenna Ushkowitz and James Monroe Iglehart. Ms. Ushkowitz starred in the television show “Glee” and has appeared in Broadway musicals, including “Waitress” and “Spring Awakening. ” Mr. Iglehart won a Tony Award in 2014 for his role as the Genie in “Aladdin. ” The video shows Mr. de Blasio, who is running for   in the coming year, sitting in the back of what appears to be one of the mayoral sport utility vehicles, talking with Ms. McCray on his cellphone. “Hey honey, I really like this song idea,” he says. “I really think it’s the perfect way to wrap up all the great things we’ve done this year. ” Ms. McCray, Ms. Hagelgans and the actors are shown in a room at Gracie Mansion. Ms. McCray puts the mayor on speaker phone so he can listen as the two actors sing, accompanied by a piano player. “In case the folks are unaware, we’ve got some facts we’d like to share,” they sing. They go on to plug mayoral programs like protections for renters, the construction and preservation of affordable housing, and a mental health initiative. “Who’s bringing cops and community close?” Ms. Ushkowitz sings as the beat goes  . “Who’s got incarceration and crime rates sinking to a record low?” The performance closes with a rousing reference to Mr. de Blasio. “No matter what will be, we’ve got Billy D. B. !” Ms. Ushkowitz belts out. The mayor starts out nodding happily to all the praise but then whispers to an aide, “This is kind of over the top. ” In the end, he delivers his review of the performance: “Maybe the song’s a little too elaborate,” he says. “Maybe we should just do a couple of tweets and a Facebook post instead. ” Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog organization, questioned whether creating the video was a justifiable use of public resources and said it raised questions because it came right before next year’s   campaign. “This is a virtual campaign ad that is meant to be a   announcement but goes beyond that in serving to promote the mayor,” Mr. Dadey said. The video is part of a broader effort by City Hall to increase its use of the internet and social media to reach out to New Yorkers directly, bypassing traditional news media. It also comes as Mr. de Blasio controls his interactions with the press, frequently avoiding questions and limiting the news conferences at which he will take questions on any topic to once a week. Eric Phillips, Mr. de Blasio’s press secretary, said that the video was produced by City Hall staff and that the actors volunteered their time. Mr. Phillips said that City Hall spent a total of $700 to pay the piano player and a composer. He said it cost an additional $170 to have the piano tuned and $30 to rent a rehearsal room. Although the mayor is running for   next year, Mr. Phillips said in a written statement that the video “doesn’t have anything to do with his campaign. ” He added, “We think New Yorkers have a right to know what their government does, and it’s our job to communicate that work in a modern way. ” The immediate effect of the video was not exactly the stuff of Broadway hit material. In the first seven hours after the video was posted on Twitter, it had received 218 likes on the mayor’s account and 88 retweets.",0

"Trump and spy chief differ on what was said in call on Russia dossier WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. spy chief James Clapper and President-elect Donald Trump gave different accounts of a phone conversation they had about a dossier of unverified, salacious claims linking Russia to Trump, who is locked in a war of words with the intelligence agencies he will command in eight days. A newcomer to politics, businessman Trump has been at odds with U.S. spy agencies for months, disputing their conclusions that Russia used hacking and other tactics to try to tilt the 2016 presidential election in his favor.  On Wednesday, he acknowledged the point but opened a new battlefront, responding to media reports of unsubstantiated claims that he was caught in a compromising position in Russia by accusing intelligence agencies of practices reminiscent of Nazi Germany. In a Wednesday night statement Clapper, director of national intelligence, said that in a call with Trump he expressed his dismay over media leaks. Clapper added that he did not believe the leaks came from U.S. intelligence agencies.  Clapper said he emphasized to Trump that the report was not produced by U.S. intelligence agencies and that they had not judged whether the information was reliable. He did not say the document was false. By contrast, Trump suggested in a tweet on Thursday that Clapper agreed that the report was untrue. “James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. Made up, phony facts. Too bad!” Trump wrote. Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, an opponent of the Republican Trump, was asked by CNN on Thursday morning about Trump’s characterization of Clapper’s statement that the document was false. “Sadly, you cannot rely on the president-elect’s tweets or statements about what he’s receiving in intelligence briefings. And that’s a real problem,” said Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. “If people really want to know what Director Clapper had to say to Donald Trump, do not rely on Donald Trump’s tweets, rely on Director Clapper’s statement.” At a news conference before speaking to Clapper, Trump accused U.S. intelligence agencies of leaking the document to the media. Two U.S. officials said the allegations about Trump, which one called “unsubstantiated,” were contained in a two-page memo appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election given to Trump and President Barack Obama. CNN reported on Tuesday about the existence of the memo. BuzzFeed published a fuller 35-page document produced by a former British foreign intelligence official that outlined the allegations of compromising behavior by Trump and his purported ties with people in Russia. The claims were included in reports about Trump known as opposition research reports prepared for political rivals of Trump during the 2016 presidential election campaign. ",0
"U.S. judge orders unsealing of Clinton email probe search warrant NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday ordered the unsealing of the application used to obtain a search warrant that allowed the FBI to gain access to emails related to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s private server before the Nov. 8 election. U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan directed the release by Tuesday of redacted materials used to obtain a search warrant after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey informed Congress of newly discovered emails on Oct. 28. Comey’s letter drew new attention to a damaging issue for Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and roiled the campaign 11 days before the Nov. 8 election, won by Republican Donald Trump. The search warrant materials’ release sought by Randol Schoenberg, a Los Angeles-based lawyer, who in court papers said transparency was crucial given the potential influence the probe had on the election’s outcome. Sources close to the investigation have said the emails were discovered during an unrelated probe into former Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. In his order, Castel said he would allow the redaction of the identities of two unnamed individuals, one of whom is subject to an “ongoing criminal investigation.” But he said the “strong presumption of access attached to the search warrant and related materials is not overcome by any remaining privacy interest of Secretary Clinton.” Lawyers for Clinton and Abedin did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did the U.S. Justice Department. A lawyer for Weiner had no immediate comment. Clinton used the server while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. In July, Comey recommended no criminal charges be brought over Clinton’s handing of classified information in the emails, although he said she and her colleagues were “extremely careless” in handling such information. In his Oct. 28 letter to Congress, Comey said emails potentially related to the Clinton server probe had been discovered in an “unrelated case.” Sources close to the investigation have said the emails were discovered during an unrelated probe into Weiner following a media report that he engaged in sexually explicit cellphone and online messaging with a 15-year-old girl. Federal investigators got a warrant to examine the emails to see if they were related to the probe into Clinton’s private server. Only two days before the election, Comey disclosed that the emails did nothing to change his earlier recommendation. ",0

Yes, I could do that and I think it would be well-received,” it quoted Trump as saying in an interview. ",0
"New Zealand held in suspense as kingmaker weighs coalition options WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealanders will likely need to wait several more days to find out who will form the new government in the South Pacific island nation, the small nationalist party holding the balance of power said on Thursday. The New Zealand First Party was holding a fifth day of talks with both the ruling National and the opposition Labour Party to form a coalition government, almost three weeks after an inconclusive general election.  Prime Minister Bill English s ruling National Party won 56 seats in the Sept. 23 election, while a Labour-Green bloc have 54 seats, leaving both needing New Zealand First s nine seats to meet the 61 seats needed for a majority in parliament. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said that he was  pretty confident  that those talks with the main parties would conclude on Thursday evening, but said the NZ First board would not meet to discuss its options until the weekend at the earliest.  It depends upon the logistical availability of the board which will be Saturday, Sunday or Monday,  Peters told reporters.  I ll know that before too long.  Asked whether the public would know who the government is by the end of next week, Peters said yes,the Stuff.co.nz media website reported.  The political limbo has pushed the New Zealand dollar, the world s 11th most traded currency, down by around 3.3 percent since the vote. The Kiwi was trading at $0.7103 mid-afternoon on Thursday after hitting a four-month low earlier this week. Two recent independent surveys have suggested the uncertainty is curbing business sentiment, although official data released on Thursday indicated that consumer confidence remained robust. There are also concerns that a government including the nationalist NZ First would lead to more interventionist economic policies. Peters fueled those fears earlier this week when he said that exporters should welcome the recent fall in the local currency. NZ First also wants to restrict foreign investment, curb immigration and renegotiate certain trade deals.  Strong immigration has been blamed for the country s hot housing market and unaffordable prices. Data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand released on Thursday showed that the number of properties sold in September was the lowest for that month for six years, as the market awaited an election result. Peters lost his own seat in the election to a National candidate but remains the lead negotiator and eligible for a ministerial post as leader of NZ First.  He said talks so far had focused on policy, with no discussions yet on ministerial portfolios or offices.  Peters said he was aiming for a  serious consensus  from the NZ First board on which party to support, but he declined to identify or number those board members. ",0
"A Great Indian Novel Reaches American Shores - The New York Times Troubles  —   like ants  —   seldom walk alone. In GHACHAR GHOCHAR (Penguin, $15, paper) a new novella by the Indian writer Vivek Shanbhag, translated from Kannada by Srinath Perur, a family is besieged by both and develops a taste for responding with imaginative cruelty. Sudden wealth only makes them more ruthless. “It’s true what they say  —   it’s not we who control money, it’s the money that controls us,” the nameless narrator realizes, a little late in the day. “When there’s only a little, it behaves meekly when it grows, it becomes brash and has its way with us. Money had swept us up and flung us in the midst of a whirlwind. ” This spiny, scary story of moral decline, crisply plotted and no thicker than my thumb, has been heralded as the finest Indian novel in a decade, notable for a book in bhasha, one of India’s vernacular languages. The Great Indian Novel has almost always referred to a particular kind of book: big, baggy, polyphonic and, crucially, written in English  —   “Midnight’s Children,” say, or “The God of Small Things. ” Admirers of this austere little tale, who include Suketu Mehta and Katherine Boo, have compared Shanbhag to Chekhov. Folded into the compressed, densely psychological portrait of this family is a whole universe: a parable of rising India, an indictment of domestic violence, a taxonomy of ants and a sly commentary on translation itself. The title is a nonsense phrase, meaning tangled beyond repair. Our narrator (who, with his excellent intentions and total lack of initiative, recalls Nick Carraway) hears it for the first time on his honeymoon. He has pounced on his new wife, Anita, in their hotel room, but can’t untie the drawstring of her sari’s petticoat. It’s all knotted up  —   ghachar ghochar, she says, reaching for a word from her childhood, a word invented by her little brother to describe a snarled kite string. The narrator is thrilled by this intimacy, to be welcomed into her secret language. In the morning, he gestures at the disheveled bedsheets, their entwined legs: ghachar ghochar. All families are their own countries, with their own idioms, rites and taboos. Anita is not the only character who has grown up within the borders of a particular culture, yet when the narrator tries to share something of his own world, as new lovers will, Anita is understandably less charmed. To survive years of privation, his peculiar family has learned to move as one. The narrator can scarcely extricate himself in his own mind: “What can I say of myself that is only about me and not tied up with the others? Wherever I try to start, I quickly run into one of three women . ’u2008. ’u2008. each more fearsome than the other. ” Everyone has a specific role. His uncle runs the family business, a spice packaging company. His fearsome mother and sister fight the family’s battles and keep his father, a   of the business, appeased until he makes a will. The narrator’s job is to stay out of the way, mainly, “killing time with great dedication. ” Anita is repulsed by her new husband’s passivity and the family’s brutal, bullying tactics. “She would need to have lived through those earlier days with us,” the narrator laments. “When the whole family stuck together, walking like a single body across the tightrope of our circumstances. Without that reality behind her, it’s all a matter of empty principle. ” Shanbhag is excellent on the inner logic of families, and of language, how even the most innocent phrases come freighted with history. In the book’s funniest set piece, the narrator’s mother tells him she’s cooking him a special breakfast. He recognizes her announcement for what it is  —   a declaration of war  —   and flees the house. His mother has chosen to make this particular dish because the smell of it nauseates Anita. Anita takes the bait, the narrator’s sister is drawn into the quarrel, then his father. The powder keg explodes. “Ghachar Ghochar” is one of the first books written in Kannada  —   a language with around 40 million speakers  —   to be published in America. And much about its provenance and its passage into English is distinct  —   it’s the product of a true collaboration between Shanbhag and Perur, a   translator whose interest in this kind of work came not from his closeness to the language but his distance. He felt divorced from his mother tongue, he told me, and hoped translation would help him find his way back. For 18 months, author and translator worked on the   book, taking it apart in Kannada and putting it back together in English  —   lightly editing it here and there, even adding a scene or two. The actual translation wasn’t the tricky part, even though Kannada is a very different language  —   looser, more permissive about repetition. In fact, the translation brought certain elements into sharper focus. To establish the past tense in Kannada requires some elaborate grammatical framing. But English is efficient and allows the action of the book to move as a mind moves, to leap between present and past. If anything, translating the book from Kannada into Indian English (for a version published in India last year) proved less complicated than the subsequent jump from Indian to American English small turns of phrase evocative to the Indian reader  —   “washing vessels” for washing dishes, “iron box” for iron  —   had to be tweaked. Perur did retain one lovely local detail. The family is accused of using umbrellas to shelter them from moonlight. In the village, where no one can afford umbrellas or knows what they are, the nouveau riche put them to absurd uses. The real work of translation is always in carrying over the unsaid  —   never more important than in a book like “Ghachar Ghochar,” where the characters are impelled by forces within themselves, their families and their communities that feel so furtive, even unspeakable. For Perur it was a matter of establishing a voice that could be convincingly savvy and blind. He wrote and rewrote the early pages until he settled on a tone he believed could carry the novel. The book in our hands is elegant, lean, balletic  —   but how can we know if the essence of the original has been communicated? When this question has been put to Vivek Shanbhag, who has himself also worked as a translator, he has recalled one particular passage from the novel. It is, notably, one of the scenes he added specifically for the translation. The narrator’s wife has gone out of town and he is idly rifling through her closet, touching her clothes, her jewelry. He catches scent of her suddenly. He presses his face into her saris to smell more, but the closer he gets, the more the smell retreats. “Whatever fragrance the whole wardrobe had was missing in the individual clothes it held. The more keenly I sought it, the further it receded. A strange mixture of feelings I could not quite grasp  —   love, fear, entitlement, desire, frustration  —   flooded through me until it seemed like I would break. ” The essence of a novel, Shanbhag seems to imply, floats like fragrance through the book. It is the emanation of the sum of its parts and cannot be isolated. And perhaps any attempt to single it out is beside the point. Translation isn’t merely an act of transportation, after all, of carrying something over. It’s asymptotic (“the more keenly I sought it, the further it receded”) a kind of contented yearning and act of ardor every bit as mysterious as the narrator’s efforts to find his beloved among her belongings.",0

"Trump Considering ’Explosive’ Executive Order on Unfair Trade The Trump administration is working on an executive order that could be much broader than the   dumping measures reported earlier, according to Axios. [Last week, the New York Times reported that President Donald Trump would sign an executive order targeting Chinese dumping into the U. S. soon after the conclusion of China President Xi Jinping state visit in Florida. Under the Obama administration, a preliminary study by the Commerce Department found that China was dumping steel into the U. S. at below market prices.  Back in September, the U. S. International Trade Commission affirmed a decision to impose   and   duties on certain steel imports from Australia, Brazil, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea and Turkey. The Trump administration recently launched a   investigation into the massive and persistent trade deficits the U. S. runs with   “trading partnets” and the unfair trading policies that may be causing them. Axios describes the potential for an executive order with broader trade sanctions as “explosive,” although it reports that while the plans are “very fluid” and there are internal disagreements about how aggressive the order will be, it likely won’t be confined to steel. Axios report Jonathan Swan says White House sources have told him: A White House official told Breitbart News that it is likely any executive order to emerge prior to the investigation into trade deficits is completed would be narrowly tailored to commodities and metals such as steel and aluminum and wouldn’t include broader manufactured goods such as appliances.",0
"Trump praises Chinese efforts on North Korea 'menace,' Pyongyang warns of strike WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised Chinese efforts to rein in “the menace of North Korea” on Thursday, after North Korean state media warned the United States of a “super-mighty preemptive strike.” Trump told a news conference “some very unusual moves have been made over the last two or three hours,” and that he was confident Chinese President Xi Jinping would “try very hard” to pressure Beijing’s ally and neighbor North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. While Trump gave no indication of what the moves might be, U.S. officials told Reuters that the United States was aware of a higher-than-usual level of activity by Chinese bombers, signaling a possible heightened state of readiness. The officials played down concerns and left open a range of possible reasons. * COMMENTARY: The next super weapon could be biological reut.rs/2oVooHc * COMMENTARY: The worrying lessons of the Syria chemical attack reut.rs/2o6r55r Those possibilities included defensive exercises or Chinese concerns over North Korea. None of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested alarm or signaled that they knew the precise reason for such Chinese activity.      U.S. officials have been saying for weeks that North Korea could soon stage another nuclear bomb test, something both the United States and China have both warned against. Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has proceeded with nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Tensions have risen sharply in recent months after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests. Trump, who took office in January, has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile. Trump has focused his efforts on North Korea on trying to persuade China to put more pressure on its ally and could view any unusual Chinese military movements as supportive of this. He told a news conference with the visiting prime minister of Italy on Thursday that the United States was “in very good shape” on North Korea and that China’s Xi, whom he met this month for a summit in Florida, was working hard to help. “We don’t know whether or not they’re able to do that, but I have absolute confidence that he will be trying very very hard.” Trump repeated a past comment that he had told Xi in Florida that China would make much better deal on trade with the United States “if you get rid of this menace or do something about this menace of North Korea.” ‘SUPER-MIGHTY PREEMPTIVE STRIKE’  The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party, struck an aggressive tone earlier on Thursday.  “In the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialists’ invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,” it said. Reclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, which followed a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang. South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted an unnamed South Korean government source as saying that the U.S. Air Force had dispatched a nuclear sniffer aircraft on Thursday to the east of the Korean Peninsula in anticipation of a possible nuclear test. The U.S. Defense Department does not comment on deployments of the WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft used to collect samples from the atmosphere to detect and analyze nuclear explosions.    The U.N. Security Council on Thursday condemned North Korea’s latest failed missile test and demanded it not conduct any more nuclear tests. South Korea’s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance. The South Korean defense ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion. “We are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever,” South Korean pilot Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. “Through this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemy’s intention to provoke us.”     William Perry, who served as U.S. defense secretary from 1994 to 1997 and negotiated with North Korea, said he did not believe Pyongyang was planning a surprise attack, despite the fiery rhetoric. But he warned: “They are doing a lot of bluster and a lot of threats, and they might misplay that hand and blunder into a war.” GRAPHIC: Carl Vinson strike group - tmsnrt.rs/2p1yGTQ GRAPHIC: North Korea's nuclear program -  tmsnrt.rs/2lE5yjF ",0
"U.S. Court Rules Infringement Suit by Trader Joe’s Can Proceed Against Pirate Joe’s - The New York Times A federal appeals court said Friday that Washington State has the authority to hear a trademark lawsuit by Trader Joe’s against a Canadian store called Pirate Joe’s that resold the grocery chain’s products. The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned a decision by a district court to dismiss the trademark case against Pirate Joe’s and its owner, Michael Hallatt. The district court had said that the violations occurred in Canada, where Trader Joe’s has no stores, and that the company failed to prove that Pirate Joe’s affected business in the United States. In its ruling, the appeals courts said the lawsuit could proceed because Mr. Hallatt’s actions  —   setting up a facsimile storefront in Vancouver, British Columbia, with knockoff branding and online merchandising  —   could devalue the   trademark. The case will return to a federal district court in Washington State. “We’re here to see it through, and that means doing this for the people who want this stuff,” Nathan Alexander, Mr. Hallatt’s lawyer, told The Associated Press. The decision reopens a case that began in October 2011 when workers at a Trader Joe’s in Bellingham, Wash. noticed Mr. Hallatt buying products in excess. He often returned several times every week. Mr. Hallatt acknowledged he was buying the products to distribute them in Canada through his store, then called Transilvania Trading, according to court documents. He later changed the name to Pirate Joe’s. Sometimes donning disguises to avoid detection, Mr. Hallatt conducted shopping runs and occasionally hired other people to buy goods on his behalf. An advertisement Mr. Hallat placed on Craigslist called for a “  for undercover work” with a “  international grocery smuggling operation. ” Court documents said Mr. Hallatt, who holds dual citizenship, had spent more than $350, 000 on goods from Trader Joe’s, which he resold in Canada at a markup. In 2013, the company filed a lawsuit in Washington against Mr. Hallatt for trademark infringement, unfair competition, false designation of origin and false advertising. It added that Pirate Joe’s was not an approved reseller. Responding to the lawsuit, Mr. Hallat said he never claimed an affiliation with the American company.",0
"U.S. needs up to 18 more Russian rocket engines: Pentagon WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon will need to buy up to 18 more Russian-built RD-180 engines to power rockets carrying U.S. military satellites into space over the next six years or so, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work said in an interview on Friday. Congress banned use of the Russian RD-180 rocket engines for military use after 2019, following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. But U.S. lawmakers eased the ban late last year, worried that it could drive United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, out of business and leave only privately held SpaceX to lift satellites into space. Work said the United States needed to ensure there were at least “two affordable and reliable means into space.” He added the RD-180 would be needed only during what he described as a transition period of new domestic rocket engine development.  “We just don’t see any way you can get a new engine in anything less than six years,” Work said. “And so, therefore, in the transition period, we believe strongly that we need RD-180 space engines. No more than 18 but, you know, that’s our position.” Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is pushing to end U.S. dependence on Russian engines used by United Launch Alliance to power its Atlas 5 rockets. McCain said last month that two Russians placed on the U.S. sanctions list because of events in Ukraine were leaders of Russian space agency Roscosmos, which he said was the parent of the company that makes the RD-180 rocket. ULA has said it was moving forward with two companies developing their own U.S. engines, Blue Origin and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, but such development programs were difficult and took years to complete.

"Christie accuses Paul, Lee of siding with ‘criminal’ Snowden on NSA New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie lashed out at Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., on “Fox and Friends” Wednesday, over their efforts to block the renewal of the Patriot Act.

Christie, a fellow Republican and likely presidential candidate who backs the Patriot Act, accused Lee and Paul of ""siding with"" NSA leaker Edward Snowden.

“He’s a criminal, he’s a criminal and he’s hiding in Russia, and he’s lecturing to us about the evils of authoritarian government, while he lives under the protective umbrella of Vladimir Putin,” Christie said. “That’s who Mike Lee and Rand Paul are siding with – with Edward Snowden? Come on.”

The beef between the senators and Christie has been growing for some time. Christie had told supporters in New Hampshire that “you can’t enjoy our civil liberties if you’re in a coffin.”

Lee later told CNN he found the remark “really disappointing” and it reflected “governing by fear and governing by false choice.” He also said Christie should be ashamed of himself.

The feud with Lee and Paul, a declared presidential candidate, comes as Congress is stuck on what to do about expiring NSA surveillance programs.

Lee backs an alternative to the Patriot Act called the USA Freedom Act. The House-passed bill aims to limit bulk collection of metadata on American citizens. But neither that, nor a straight, short-term extension of the Patriot Act, was able to advance in the Senate before lawmakers left on the holiday break. The data collection program is set to expire at the end of the month.

During his interview on Fox News, Christie also blasted President Obama’s strategy in the Middle East – citing the Islamic State’s growing influence, as well as Syrian President Bashar Assad's.

“If a President Christie had drawn a red line in Syria,” the United Sates would have gone after Assad as promised, he said.

Christie also criticized Obama for not being aggressive enough bringing together allies in the Middle East.

“They need American support and American leadership and American strategic vision, this president hasn’t put it out there, this is the guy who called them the JV,” Christie said. “Now, all of a sudden. He’s got a strategy that’s successful? It’s been disappointing to watch it.”",0
"State Department misses deadline to manage email records electronically WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department, which was criticized for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, said on Wednesday it failed to meet an end-of-2016 deadline to manage all its email records electronically. The department, and other U.S. government agencies, had more than four years to meet the deadline under an Aug. 24, 2012, directive that aimed to eliminate the use of paper records as much as possible in favor of electronic record-keeping. That directive was part of an Obama administration effort to update government record-keeping for the digital age and promote accountability for official decisions by ensuring they are properly documented and preserved for future generations. In a report posted by the National Archives on Wednesday, the State Department checked the “No” box in response to a question on whether it had met the goal of managing all its email records in an electronic format by Dec. 31, 2016. In the report, the State Department said it had met the goal on its main, centralized email systems accounting for the “overwhelming majority” of its emails. “However, the Department does have additional email systems that require further evaluation before we will certify that all email records are managed in an electronic format,” it said, saying it was working hard to “fully meet” the goal. The State Department had no immediate comment on the matter. The department’s record-keeping and email archiving practices attracted scrutiny during the 2016 presidential campaign when the New York Times reported that Clinton had used a private email server as secretary of state. The Democrat’s use of the server to conduct official business throughout her 2009-2013 State Department tenure was criticized by Republican Donald Trump, who defeated her for the presidency in last November’s election. An internal government watchdog issued a report last year that found Clinton broke government rules by using the private email server for her work as America’s top diplomat without approval. The State Department’s Office of the Inspector General said it found no evidence Clinton sought permission to use a server at her Chappaqua, New York, home to handle her work emails and it quoted officials as saying they would have rejected her doing so if they had been asked. The report also found problems in department record-keeping practices before Clinton’s tenure, and it documented how slowly the department had moved to bring record-keeping into the age of electronic communications.

"The Daily 202: Why blocking Obama’s pick to replace Scalia could cost Republicans their Senate majority Mitch McConnell has decided to wager the Republican majority in the Senate on blocking Barack Obama’s pick for the Supreme Court.

It’s a bold and understandable gambit designed to prevent a leftward lurch in jurisprudence after Antonin Scalia’s unexpected death this weekend, but it could backfire badly.

Assuming the president picks a Hispanic, African American or Asian American – bonus points if she’s a woman – this could be exactly what Democrats need to re-activate the Obama coalition that fueled his victories in 2008 and 2012. Even if he does not go with a minority candidate, the cases on the docket will galvanize voters who are traditionally less likely to turn out.

[Get your campaign fix delivered directly to your email inbox with The Daily 202]

Last night in Las Vegas, for example, Hillary Clinton said it would be nakedly partisan and unconscionable if Republicans don’t give a hearing to the president’s nominee. And she emphasized the immigration case that the justices recently agreed to hear. “Because of his passing, there will be most likely a tie, four to four, on important issues that affect so many people in our country,” the Democratic front-runner said. “And the most important is the decision about President Obama’s actions under DACA and DAPA. If there is no new justice appointed, then as with other cases before the court, the decision that was decided will stay in place. And that was a bad decision.”

Keep in mind that a quarter of Nevada’s population is Hispanic. Beyond being a battleground in the presidential race, there is also an open Senate race to succeed Harry Reid. Democrats will nominate a Latina and Republicans will nominate a white guy who is already in Congress.

Or take abortion rights. Marco Rubio is against abortion even in cases of rape and incest. For women, the prospect of Roe v. Wade being overturned just became much more real. “When I’m president of the United States, I’ll nominate someone like Justice Scalia,” the Florida senator declared on the Sunday shows.

And environmentalists just this month saw the court put a stay on Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The next justice will be the swing vote who determines the future of coal in the United States. Though these sorts of cases mean that business interests will pour more money than ever into 2016 races, it could also help Democrats attract crucial suburban women who might lean to the right but worry about global warming.

More broadly, this could also undermine efforts by Senate Republicans to show that they are capable of governing and not just “the party of no.” Make no mistake: The upper chamber will grind to a standstill if the GOP follows through on this threat. Democrats who are inclined to work with them promise to stop doing so if Republicans play hardball.

-- Ultimately, though, there is not really anything Democrats can do procedurally to force Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to hold a hearing on Obama’s nominee. The only lever they have is public pressure.

The most potent pressure points are the seven GOP incumbents who are up for reelection this year in states Obama carried in 2012. New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte and Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson publicly came out in favor of obstruction yesterday. The others are holding their cards close to the vest for right now: Ohio’s Rob Portman praised Scalia but would not address the core issue. Spokesmen for Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey declined to comment and Illinois’ Mark Kirk ignored inquiries, per CNN.

Pay particularly close attention to Portman, who is already vulnerable and could be wiped out if African Americans make up the same percentage of the electorate in 2016 as they did in 2012. They are likelier to vote if they believe he is disrespecting the first black president.

“I intend to continue to talk about this until the polls close,” former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, the Democratic candidate against Portman, told my colleague Paul Kane yesterday. “Senator Portman, who has your allegiance, your country or your party leaders? … The people have spoken, on two occasions,” he added, referring to Obama’s 2008 and 2012 victories.

-- Conventional wisdom is that whichever party wins the White House in November will control the Senate. That’s obviously the primary factor, but we’re not convinced it will be determinative. Democrats need to pick up four seats to win the Senate, and it’s conceivable they could get those from states that Clinton would probably carry even if she loses the Electoral College. In 2014, it’s worth recalling, Democrats lost each of the seven seats they had to defend in states Mitt Romney had carried two years earlier.

And remember that this won’t be happening in a vacuum: If Obama knows for sure that his pick is not going to get formally considered, he can go with someone who gives his party maximum political leverage to bludgeon these Republican incumbents. Monica Márquez is the first Latina and first openly gay justice on the Supreme Court in Colorado, which will again be a crucial swing state. Attorney General Loretta Lynch is an African American woman. Lucy Koh is the first Asian American district judge in the Northern District of California. He could also go with someone who was previously confirmed unanimously by the Senate to give additional rhetorical heft to his attacks that Republicans are being hypocrites.

-- What’s the Republican political calculus? Blocking judges historically motivates their base – including donors and the U.S. Chamber – more than it does liberals. And they don’t think independents will really care all that much. It will just sound like more Washington noise. McConnell, not a favorite of the grassroots, also needs to keep his own base ginned up. Amidst a presidential primary, it is untenable for Republicans to look like rubber stamps for Obama.

Chris Christie offers a cautionary tale for GOP members. His bubble in New Hampshire was punctured when opponents began attacking him for offering support of Sonia Sotomayor while he was running for governor of New Jersey in 2008. Christie denied making comments he had made. Allies and rivals agree that the Sotomayor hit was a turning point for his campaign. Republicans who fear primary challenges, such as Alabama’s Richard Shelby, are never going to back any Obama nominee.

Most smart Republicans in D.C. still believe either Trump or Cruz would lose a general election. Their hope is that a Supreme Court vacancy might help galvanize conservative volunteers to go do work for endangered Senate incumbents.

-- To be sure, not every Democrat has a clean nose on this: Harry Reid shortsightedly invoked the nuclear option in 2013, which allows non-Supreme court judges to be approved by a simple majority. This incensed Republicans and only accelerated the upper chamber’s decline to be more like the unruly House.

Lindsey Graham, one of just two current GOP senators who voted to confirm Elena Kagan during Obama’s first term, tells The Post that Reid poisoned the well by going nuclear. “I voted for every Supreme Court justice nominated by Bush and Obama. I believe the Senate should be deferential to qualified picks,” the South Carolina senator said. “But I did tell Harry Reid and the president that the consequence of changing the rules in the Senate to pack the court will come back to haunt them.”

George F. Will also zeroes in on Reid’s use of the nuclear option in his column today, which he describes as “institutional vandalism.” He frames the battle this way: “Scalia’s death will enkindle a debate missing from this year’s presidential campaign, a debate discomfiting for some conservatives: Do they want a passive court that is deferential to legislative majorities and to presidents who claim untrammeled powers deriving from national majorities? Or do they want a court actively engaged in defending liberty’s borders against unjustified encroachments by majorities?”

-- The big question right now: Will there even be a confirmation hearing?

McConnell’s Saturday night statement declaring that the vacancy should be filled by the next president did not rule out the possibility of a confirmation hearing or floor time to consider whoever the president picks.

That might be the more politically astute play, since Republicans could slow walk the vetting, trickle out negative revelations about the nominee to right-wing media outlets and then ultimately vote to reject the nominee.

Having hearings could give some cover to purple state Republicans to say they are doing their jobs. “If the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they're going to lose control of the Senate,"" said Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.

Plus, even if Obama’s pick gets past the Judiciary Committee, they will be hard pressed to get confirmed by the full Senate. Fourteen Republicans would need to come out against Cruz’s promised filibuster. During Obama’s first term, when Democrats held a near super-majority, only nine Republicans voted for Sotomayor and five voted for Kagan.

Given that the Senate is on a President’s Day recess, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama will not rush out an announcement this week. This gives both sides a few days to poll and focus group their options.

A former top adviser to the president says the GOP could have been savvier:

-- Another wildcard: How will the press cover this? One of the mainstream media’s problems is a really short attention span. What is unknowable today is whether this vacancy is a two-week story, a two-month story or a 10-month story? Also, is the narrative that Republicans are creating an unprecedented Constitutional crisis? Or is it played as a boring he-said, he-said storyline?

Democrats note that Obama still has the bully pulpit, so he can come up with creative ways to drive news coverage about the GOP’s failure to bring his nominee up for a vote. The party can also use paid media to target the vulnerable Republican incumbents.

-- For both sides, it really is difficult to overstate the stakes: Scalia left an indelible mark on both the court and our country for nearly three decades, and his replacement could do the same. Ironically, if Clinton wins and Democrats retake the Senate after McConnell spends the year taking heat, she will have a mandate to put the most progressive justice imaginable on the bench. And Republicans will have no real grounds to oppose her. For McConnell, right now, that’s a risk worth taking.

THE BUZZ AT THE CAPITOL: “Some hopeful Democrats now see the nomination of a sitting senator as the best chance Obama has to seat another justice on the Supreme Court before leaving office,” Juliet Eilperin and Paul Kane report. “There are several Senate Democrats who fit that description, including Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), Christopher A. Coons (Del.) and Richard J. Durbin (Ill.). But individuals who have spoken with the White House about the nomination process … said the president is interested in a candidate who is young enough to serve an extended period of time. Only two of those senators — Klobuchar, at 55, and Coons, at 52 — are younger than 60, the age Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was when she was nominated.”

… But we hear that POTUS is more likely to go with someone who has already been confirmed and vetted. “Although Obama has installed fewer federal appellate judges than either Presidents Clinton or George W. Bush, he has put enough nominees on the bench that Democratic appointees are in the majority on nine of the nation’s 13 circuit courts,” Juliet and Paul note. “In that group, the 9th Circuit’s Paul J. Watford, a 48-year-old African American, and Sri Srinivasan, a 48-year-old judge on U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit who would be the first South-Asian American on the Supreme Court, would be the leading contenders. Others include the D.C. Circuit’s Patricia Ann Millett, 52, and Jane L. Kelly, 51, a judge on the 8th Circuit who was confirmed 96 to 0” with the support of Grassley.

-- What does the loss of Scalia mean for cases currently on the docket? “In the short term, conservatives could still prevail on many of the cases before the court this term. But the wins could come in the form of tie votes that preserve the status quo rather than provide precedents that will shape the future,” writes Robert Barnes, our Supreme Court correspondent.

A big break for public employee unions: “At oral arguments, the court seemed prepared to hand a significant defeat to organized labor and side with a group of California teachers who claim that their free-speech rights are violated when they are forced to pay dues to the state’s teachers union. The court’s conservatives — Scalia included — appeared ready to junk a 40-year-old precedent that allows unions to collect an ‘agency fee’ from nonmembers to support collective-bargaining activities for members and nonmembers alike. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, citing that precedent, had ruled for the union. And with the Supreme Court’s liberals seemingly united in upholding the precedent, a 4-to-4 vote would mean the union victory would stand.”

The law could be interpreted differently in different regions: “For instance, a Texas law that imposes new restrictions on abortion providers was found constitutional by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. A 4-to-4 tie would uphold that finding. But a similar law in Wisconsin was struck down and would be unaffected by the court’s tie in the Texas case.”

Barnes adds that, if Republican leaders hold firm, it will also affect which cases the justices choose to take up when the next term starts in October. (Read a breakdown of how four cases will likely be impacted here.)

-- Chaos, confusion and conflicting reports in the hours after Scalia’s death, which happened during a blue quail hunting trip. From Lana Straub, Eva Ruth Moravec, Sari Horwitz and Jerry Markon: After his body was discovered, it took hours for authorities in remote West Texas to find a justice of the peace. “When they did, she pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body and decided not to order an autopsy. A second justice of the peace, who was called but couldn’t get to Scalia’s body in time, said she would have ordered an autopsy. ‘If it had been me . . . I would want to know,’ Juanita Bishop, a justice of the peace in Presidio, Tex., told The Washington Post in an interview Sunday.”

Some details of his final hours at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury compound less than an hour from the Mexican border, remain opaque: “As late as Sunday afternoon, there were conflicting reports about whether an autopsy would be performed, though officials later said Scalia’s body was being embalmed and there would be no autopsy. One report, by WFAA-TV in Dallas, said the death certificate would show the cause of the death was a heart attack.”

Ratings: 13.5 million watched the CBS debate on Saturday, surpassing the 13.3 million who watched last weekend’s debate on ABC and the 8 million who watched the Democratic debate in Milwaukee on PBS/CNN. (CNN Money)

Driving the day: Laura and George W. Bush headline a rally for Jeb in North Charleston tonight. “It tacks away from Bush’s months-long insistence that he’s running as ‘my own man,’ but could be a perfect fit for South Carolina,” the Associated Press notes in a curtain-raiser. “George H.W. Bush won twice here. In 2000, George W. Bush beat John McCain. Now it’s his brother’s turn.”

Kasich’s super PAC circulated a CNN clip from when Jeb said in New Hampshire last May, “I think that in Washington during my brother's time Republicans spent too much money. He could have used the veto power. He didn't have line item veto power, but he could have brought budget discipline to Washington, D.C.""

Republican leaders are predicting record turnout in Saturday’s primary: “The electorate here will be about twice as big as Iowa and New Hampshire combined,” said state GOP Chairman Matt Moore. “A third are very conservative, a third are somewhat; a third are moderate.” He’s quoted in a Charleston Post and Courier story about efforts to “restore South Carolina’s credibility in picking the eventual nominee.” From the piece: “GOP voters here chose correctly in all the party races since 1980 until the turnabout in 2012. ‘South Carolinians kind of blew it last time voting for Gingrich,’ said Clemson professor David Woodard, who thinks the state is Trump’s to lose. ‘They’re taking their ‘first-in-the-South primary’ and ‘we pick presidents’ to heart. There is a seriousness here that’s on display this time.’”

On the Sunday shows, Trump focused on Cruz. ""Justice John Roberts gave us Obamacare twice,"" Trump said on ABC. ""He could have ended Obamacare twice. He got there because Ted Cruz pushed him like wild. ... Cruz shouldn't be talking because that was among the worst appointments I've ever seen. We have Obamacare because of Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and George Bush."" Trump also emphasized Cruz's personality: ""No endorsements, no support — he's a lone wolf. He's going to get nothing done, he's not a leader, he's never employed anybody, never created a job. He's a nasty guy, no matter how you figure it.”

… And Cruz focused on Trump: ""If Donald Trump becomes president, the Second Amendment will be written out of the Constitution because it is abundantly clear that Donald Trump is not a conservative. He will not invest the capital to confirm a conservative, so the result will be the same whether it’s Hillary, Bernie or Donald,"" Cruz said. ""The Second Amendment will go away."" (Elise Viebeck)

Trump changed his explanation for why no one can find proof that he opposed the invasion of Iraq before 2003: “I wasn’t a politician so people didn’t write everything I said,” he said on “Meet the Press.” In September, he said there was ample documentation: “I’ll give you 25 different stories.” BuzzFeed notes that an August 2004 interview with Esquire is the first known instance of his public opposition.

Both candidates courted the African American vote at the same Baptist church in Las Vegas. John Wagner relays an incredibly awkward scene: “Clinton and her motorcade already had arrived the Victory Missionary Baptist Church, located in an economically struggling neighborhood west of the Vegas Strip, when Sanders’s entourage pulled in with a police escort. Clinton was seated in the first row, on the left side. Sanders took a seat in the first row, on the right side. The candidates did not shake hands or talk.”

Later, Clinton stepped up her attacks on Sanders over health care in a Vegas suburb: ""We both share the goal of universal health-care coverage, but he wants to start all over again,"" she said at a rally after church. ""And he wants to have a new system that would be quite challenging because you would have to give up the insurance you have now, and it would cost a lot of money. The goal is a good goal -- I absolutely agree with that -- but the last thing our country needs now is to be thrown into another contentious debate about health care."" (David Weigel)

The Review-Journal reports that Sanders has spent twice as much on TV ads in Nevada as Clinton, $2.93 million to $1.46 million.

Trolling HRC, the conservative super PAC American Crossroads launched a $42,000 digital buy to highlight hardline comments she’s made about illegal immigration during previous races. Watch here.

-- “Debate rips open GOP wounds, and party risks tearing itself apart,” by Robert Costa and Philip Rucker: “The GOP is at risk of tearing itself apart over its past as it heads into the thick of the primary season. A day after a debate marked by personal, petty exchanges, Republicans were grappling with their core beliefs, as well as the image they were broadcasting to the country … The increasingly harsh discussions of these and other issues amount to an existential crisis within the Republican Party and reflect the growing influence of non-ideological, populist voters. Contenders are making their most concerted effort yet to stop Trump [in South Carolina], even though previous attempts to take him down have attained little. The escalating quarreling may increase the likelihood of a long, expensive and potentially futile effort … As the candidates returned to the campaign trail, the mess they left behind on the stage of Greenville’s Peace Center had some party strategists wondering whether the damage may be politically irreparable.”

-- “What made the friendship between Scalia and Ginsburg work,” by Irin Carmon: “Nino and RBG, the court’s most famous odd couple friendship stood as an example of warmth and professionalism across traditional divides … The reserved Clinton appointee and the bombastic Reagan pick had vastly different views on the constitution and the role of the court. And yet. One former clerk told us Scalia was Ginsburg’s favored souvenir shopping buddy when they traveled together. On a trip to India, they famously rode an elephant, with Scalia sitting up front. They shared New Year’s Eves with their families and friends. In 2010, when Chief Justice Roberts announced [Ginsburg’s husband] Marty’s death from the bench, Scalia wiped tears from his eyes … Whether or not it was how Scalia saw it, for Ginsburg their public friendship also made a statement about the court as an institution: that it was strengthened by respectful debate, that it could work no matter how polarized its members were.”

-- “A mini world war rages in the fields of Aleppo,” by Liz Sly: “Across the olive groves and wheat fields of the northern Syrian province of Aleppo, a battle with global dimensions risks erupting into a wider war. Russian warplanes are bombing from the sky. Iraqi and Lebanese militias aided by Iranian advisers are advancing on the ground. An assortment of Syrian rebels backed by the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are fighting to hold them back. Kurdish forces are taking advantage of the chaos, [while] the Islamic State has snatched a couple of small villages … Syria’s civil war long ago mutated into a proxy conflict, with competing world powers backing the rival Syrian factions almost since the earliest days of the armed rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad. But perhaps never before have the dangers — or the complications — of what amounts to a mini world war been so apparent as in the battle underway for control of Aleppo.”

-- Doug Sosnik’s take on the road ahead: The Democratic strategist, who served as a close adviser to Bill Clinton during his presidency, is known in Washington for insightful memos that diagnose the national mood. We got the latest one. Three nuggets jumped out—

Independents will see the 2016 election as a choice between the lesser of two evils: “This year’s Republican primary is the most rightward leaning since 1964, while Democrats have not been this far to the left since the 1972 campaign. As the parties have become increasingly ideological, Americans have drifted away from both of them. Self-identified independents are at near historic levels. … In this period of profound alienation, with both parties engaging in harsh ideological primaries, the public is likely to view the entire political process as a race to the bottom. They will be inclined to view their choice for president through the prism of which candidate is the least flawed and poses the least threat to their future well-being.”

Obama’s approval rating is remarkably durable: “Since the summer of 2009, when these divisions began to intensify, Obama’s positive job approval ratings have remained flat, never going below 40% or above 53%. A closer look at these numbers shows the impact that age, race and income have had on his ratings. The narrow band reflects little movement from Obama’s core supporters, as well as steadfast opposition from his detractors.”

The Democratic primary in New York will matter: “In the period between the March primaries and the middle of April, fewer than 400 delegates will be selected. With the exception of the Wisconsin primary on April 5th, most of the attention will be focused on the New York (Wall Street) primary on April 19th. The last two key dates during the primary will be April 26th, when five northeastern states will select 384 delegates, and June 7th when California and five other states west of the Mississippi will hold elections.”

-- “REVENGE OF THE POPULISTS” is the headline on the front page of The State to describe the success of Trump and Sanders. The Columbia, S.C., newspaper searches for historical antecedents: “Trump rails against immigrants, echoing the nativist, mid-1800s Know Nothing Party that grew out of fears that an influx of Catholic immigrants was threatening the American way of life. Sanders’ outcry against banks and corporations has its roots in the populist movement of the late 1800s, formed by a coalition of laborers and farmers, suffering, they said, under high loan and railroad rates that lined the elite’s pockets.”

The article emphasizes similarities in their messaging and supporters: “Angst over the economy — as in populist movements of the past — has led to similar lines of attack from Trump and Sanders. ‘This is not a rising-tide-that-lifts-all-boats recovery,’ said Danielle Vinson, a Furman University political scientist. … Both Trump and Sanders, for instance, denounce trade deals … Both have taken more isolationist stances in foreign policy … Both also have cast Washington politicians as shills for corporate interests.”

-- The State also looks at the 12 percent of South Carolina voters who say they are undecided: “Retired oncologist Tripp Jones say his choice presents a dilemma in Saturday’s Republican presidential primary. None of the six candidates left in the GOP field fits the bill for Jones, a longtime Republican who ‘wants somebody who is going to take America to the next level but has common sense.’ Jones is among the 1-in-8 Republicans who are undecided as Saturday’s primary looms. Political ads do little for him. ‘I’ve got to settle on one, but I don’t have a clue yet who it will be,’ he said. Other voters plan to wait until the end. ‘I’m going to let it all play out,’ said Irmo Town Councilwoman Kathy Condom, who plans to vote Republican. ‘I’ll figure it out on the 19th (of February).’”

Who they are --> Politico, “The Whale That Nearly Drowned The Donald,” by Michael Crowley: “Akio Kashiwagi was a mysterious figure reputed to have underworld connections. He was one of the world’s top five gamblers, a ‘whale’ in casino parlance, willing to wager $10 million in a single gaming bender. After his murder, one unnamed executive told the paper that Kashiwagi had owed the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino $4 million … The story of Kashiwagi, drawn from Trump’s memoirs and news accounts from the day, offers a revealing window into Trump’s instincts. It shows that Trump isn’t just a one-time casino owner—he’s also a gambler, prone to impulsive, even reckless action. Trump is obsessed with winning, a topic he usually brings up in the context of his merciless deal-making style. But a crucial question about any would-be president who may be confronted with questions of war and peace is his attitude toward risk. Some presidents are highly averse to it … Others roll the dice.”

-- The Atlantic, “The 'New Look' of the Post-Obama Electorate,” by Theodore R. Johnson: “In 2008, when then-Senator Barack Obama rode the highest black voter turnout in U.S. history to the White House, black voters felt The Look had been exchanged … African American voters felt that a black president could give them special attention and understand black America’s grievances better than any other. It wasn’t favoritism African Americans sought; they simply wanted an acknowledgement that structural racism is real and some executive resolve to address it from the first president to have experienced it firsthand. But things haven’t gone quite as they had hoped. The welled-up hope that racism would be a presidential priority and undergo an incremental process of amelioration began to slowly dissipate in the face of politics as usual … And frustration has given rise to a new generation of black voters and activists, a generation who uses more overt and dynamic techniques to influence the political agenda.”

--The New Yorker, “Can Cruz Beat Trump on Conservative Principles?,” by Ryan Lizza: “Ted Cruz is the best political tactician in the Republican race. But for all of Cruz’s tactical successes so far, he made one enormous mistake: he misunderstood the threat posed by Trump. By repeatedly praising Trump throughout 2015, Cruz did more than any other Republican to validate the reality-TV star as a true conservative … Cruz, the most well-funded conservative, stuck to his hug-Trump strategy until just a few days before the Iowa caucuses. At the CBS debate, [he] tried desperately to undo that damage, and his attempt to unmask Trump as a closet liberal led to the most fiery exchange of the evening. And now there is a new accelerant to the Cruz–Bush campaign to turn Trump into a liberal: Antonin Scalia’s death. For many ideological conservatives, the makeup of the Supreme Court is the most important issue in America … [and] the success of Cruz’s campaign may depend on that fight.”

-- New York Times, “A Leisurely Return for the New York State Legislature,” by Jesse McKinley: “Last week, [New York’s] 213 elected lawmakers — or as many who were able to attend — gathered for a couple of hours, passed a few minor bills and some well-meaning resolutions, and then formally adjourned for a 14-day winter break, officially ending their workweek. The time was 1:32 p.m. On a Tuesday. Two months after the corruption convictions of Sheldon Silver and Dean G. Skelos, the former leaders of the State Assembly and Senate … that sense of urgency has seemingly dissipated, unable to penetrate the intractable culture of Albany: The 2016 Legislature has yet to offer any new bills related to ethics reform, and the leaders have been noncommittal on a raft of proposals made by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The state’s lawmakers have responded with a leisurely return to well-established habits, marked by two-day weeks in the capital, six-minute floor sessions and a collection of one-house bills with little or no chance of becoming law.”

-- At the White House: President Obama is still in California, where he'll meet with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Rancho Mirage throughout the day.

-- On the campaign trail: Bernie Sanders is in Ypsilanti and Dearborn, Mich., while John Kasich stops in Allendale, East Lansing and Utica. Hillary Clinton is in Elko and Reno, Nevada. The rest of the field is in South Carolina. Here's the rundown:

NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:

Temperatures remain below freezing keeping those untreated surfaces very slick. Highs range from 25-30.”

INTRIGUE: Vince Gray is running against the woman he anointed to succeed him on the D.C. Council. “His former protege insists she is not retreating,” Paul Schwartzman reports. “Yvette Alexander, in an interview, accused Gray of challenging her as a first step toward a 2018 mayoral bid that would avenge his loss to Muriel E. Bowser in the 2014 Democratic primary. ‘He’s just trying to get his foot in the door,’ Alexander said. ‘If Vince Gray is honest about it, he would tell the truth and say, ‘I want to run for mayor. I want to get revenge.’ That’s who he is, and Ward 7 knows it.’"" She also suggested that he didn’t get indicted because he “had a very good attorney.” Gray spokesman Chuck Thies fired back: “Vince doesn’t feel that she has grown in the job. When you’ve been there for eight years and you’re not an influential council member, it’s time for you to go. At this point, Yvette is just taking up space. That’s not Vince’s fault.”

"After F.B.I.’s Inquiry Into Omar Mateen, a Focus on What Else Could Be Done - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   Every day, in F. B. I. offices around the country, agents leaf through classified counterterrorism documents on American citizens one last time. They reread informant reports and review surveillance logs. And then they close the case and walk away. It is a weighty decision, one that supervisors closely review. But with up to 10, 000 F. B. I. terrorism investigations open at any given time, there is little time for  . The nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla. in which a gunman killed 49 people, has brought unusual attention to a seemingly mundane process. For 10 months, F. B. I. agents investigated the gunman, Omar Mateen, but closed the investigation after following a standard checklist. F. B. I. supervisors approved the decision. Managers in Washington, who can reverse any decision to close a case, were notified. Officials said there was nothing particularly remarkable about the decision  —   until Sunday’s predawn shooting. On Tuesday, the F. B. I. was scrutinizing Mr. Mateen’s computer use, trying to learn how much his wife knew before the attack. Attorney General Loretta Lynch pledged a thorough investigation that would also address “if there are lessons we can learn to prevent another tragedy. ” But perhaps the biggest question raised by this episode  —   as it was after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and the shooting in Garland, Tex. last year  —   is why the perpetrator’s behavior was alarming enough to attract the F. B. I. ’s attention, but could not be stopped. The answer is in part a reflection of American vigilance in the era of “see something, say something. ” Tens of thousands of counterterrorism tips flow to the F. B. I. each year. Some are legitimate. Others come from vengeful   or people casting suspicion on  . Thousands of investigations are opened and closed. Right now, law enforcement officials say, the F. B. I. is investigating 1, 000 potential “homegrown violent extremists,” the majority of whom are most likely tied to or inspired by the Islamic State. Fifty to 100 are considered the highest priority. The flood of leads is so relentless that, years ago, counterterrorism agents hung an   section of fire hose outside their office suite in Northern Virginia as a symbol of their mission. Intelligence agencies in Europe and the Middle East face similar challenges, particularly with the rise of the Islamic State. But in the United States, Americans enjoy the unique protections of the First and Second Amendments. Criticizing, or even hating, the American government is not a crime. Neither is declaring support for the Islamic State or buying a gun. The number of agents working on terrorism cases is classified and changes with the threat, but across the country it amounts to several thousand, along with countless analysts. Sorting out angry Americans talking tough from   terrorists is among their biggest challenges. In Mr. Mateen’s case,   said in 2013 that he had boasted of ties to the terrorist groups Hezbollah and Al Qaeda. The remarks prompted the local sheriff to request his removal from the St. Lucie County Courthouse in Fort Pierce, Fla. where he worked as a security guard. The security contractor transferred him to work at a residential golfing community, and the sheriff alerted the F. B. I. Government officials said his claim had been dubious from the beginning. Hezbollah is a Shiite group Al Qaeda is Sunni. But agents opened what is known as a preliminary investigation. They secretly followed him and monitored his movements. They interviewed him twice, and dispatched an informant to get close to him in an investigation that spanned nearly a year. “I think the F. B. I. has an incredibly hard job, because this guy seems like a lone wolf,” said Caroline Fredrickson, the president of the American Constitution Society, a frequent critic of the agency. “He was an American citizen born in the United States. Law enforcement has been working its butt off to figure out what else could be done. ” This dilemma is not new, but it has become more acute in recent years. For years after the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the F. B. I. used Al Qaeda’s rigid hierarchy against the terrorist group. Government experts knew how plots were hatched and who approved them. They knew the terrorism pedigree of the key figures, and monitored travel to watch for people training in camps. Today, the Islamic State encourages anyone to take up arms in its name. Travel and training are unnecessary. Veteran counterterrorism agents ruefully note that the difference between America’s latest school shooting and its latest terrorist attack is whether the gunman praised the Islamic State  —   regardless of whether he had any actual ties to the group. Preventing those attacks is a fundamentally different mission, said James W. McJunkin, a former senior F. B. I. official who oversaw terrorism cases for years during Al Qaeda’s heyday. “It’s the counterterrorism equivalent of ‘How do you prevent someone from robbing a liquor store? ’” he said. After receiving a briefing Tuesday from investigators, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said Mr. Mateen appeared to have been motivated by a mixture of violent radicalization and hatred for gays and lesbians. “The picture is filling in, though there are still a lot of unanswered questions,” he said. Among those questions is whether Mr. Mateen’s wife knew about his plans. His wife, Noor Zahi Salman, told the F. B. I. that she had driven him to the Pulse nightclub at some point before the attack and that she had been with him when he bought ammunition, a senior law enforcement official said. She said she had tried to talk him out of waging an attack, the official said. Her statements were first reported by NBC News. “There’s an indication that she was with him in certain parts of the process, and we’re sorting through it,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is at an early stage. “We don’t know what’s true and what’s not. ” Ms. Salman is not in custody, the official said. While a person who withholds knowledge of a crime could face criminal charges, she is not facing imminent arrest, and no decisions have been made on whether she might be prosecuted, the official said. Neighbors of Ms. Salman’s parents in Rodeo, Calif, who are of Palestinian descent, said she had grown up in a Muslim household. She and her sisters were not allowed to drive, they said. They said they understood Mr. Mateen to be a controlling husband who frequently forbade his wife to visit her family. As the F. B. I. pieces together details of Mr. Mateen’s life, lawmakers and lobbyists are already questioning whether the authorities missed any leads. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Obama administration officials demanding information about Mr. Mateen, his family and the dates he was on a terrorism watch list. James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, has said Mr. Mateen was on a watch list during his investigation. Once it was closed, he was removed from the list, as is required. “We don’t keep people under investigation indefinitely,” he said. Even if Mr. Mateen had remained on the watch list, it would not have stopped him from buying a gun. Congress blocked an attempt last year to give the F. B. I. the power to block gun sales to people on terrorism watch lists. Had he been on a watch list, however, agents would have been alerted to the gun sale. “Certainly in retrospect in this case we would have liked to have known about it,” Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates said. She said the Justice Department would consider a new policy in which the F. B. I. is alerted on gun sales to people who were previously under investigation for terrorism. The National Rifle Association moved quickly to quash discussion of new gun policies. In a piece for USA Today, Chris W. Cox, the group’s executive director, blamed the federal authorities for not doing more to stop Mr. Mateen. “His former   reported violent and racist comments,” Mr. Cox wrote. “Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s political correctness prevented anything from being done about it. ”",0
"Jenna Bush Hager and Michael Keaton Flub Movie Title at Golden Globes - The New York Times Let’s just be very clear about this: There is no movie called “Hidden Fences. ” But you would be forgiven for thinking otherwise after watching the Golden Globes, after the nonexistent movie was mentioned twice. The first time was definitely a mistake. The second time is not so clear. First, NBC’s Jenna Bush Hager, taking her first turn at Golden Globes reporting, presumably meant to ask Pharrell Williams about his best original score nomination for “Hidden Figures,” a movie about three black women who would play crucial roles in the American space program. Surely she didn’t mean to ask him about “Fences,” a similarly renowned film starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. Mr. Williams had no involvement in that. But: Mr. Williams’s   reaction, in which he appeared to be doing his best to hold back whatever he badly wished to say, was impressive in its restraint. Unsurprisingly, the immediate reaction on Twitter was less restrained. “So Jenna Bush is just merging all of the black movies tonight at the #GoldenGlobes, huh?” one user asked. “Pharrell’s face just held hundreds of years of whitewashing resolve,” another said. Others had fun in similarly inventing new movie titles. That seemed to be the end of things, but for some reason, Michael Keaton also referred to “Hidden Fences” when listing the nominees for best supporting actress in a motion picture. Since the camera was focused on the actresses, it’s unclear if Mr. Keaton said it with a wink and a nod.",0
"Cuban dissidents in electoral challenge as Castro era nears end HAVANA (Reuters) - Opponents of the Cuban government are putting forward an unprecedented number of candidates for municipal elections in late October, the first step in a process to select a new president after nearly 60 years of the Castro brothers  rule. The electoral cycle comes at a tricky time for the Caribbean nation as the Castros  revolutionary generation dies off, an economic reform program appears stalled, aid from key ally Venezuela shrinks, and the Trump administration threatens. The municipal vote, the only part of the electoral process with direct participation by ordinary Cubans, is expected to attract 35,000 candidates for the island s 168 municipal assemblies. It will be followed by provincial and national assembly elections in which candidates are selected from slates by commissions. The new national assembly will in late February select a successor to President Raul Castro, 86, who has announced he will step aside after two terms. Raul, younger brother and successor to Fidel Castro who died in November, will retain a grip on power as head of the Communist Party, the only legal party in Cuba. The elections are being cast in state-run media as a show of support for the Castros  1959 revolution rather than an opportunity to debate the pressing issues. Campaigning is prohibited and candidates for the 12,515 ward delegate positions are nominated at neighborhood meetings based on their personal merits, not policy positions. They need not belong to the Communist Party and many candidates are independents but only few government opponents have ever competed. During the last election, the three dissidents nominated lost at the polls.  This year, however, one coalition of opposition groups, Otro18 (Other18), says it is running more than 160 candidates in the municipal elections, demanding electoral reform and government transparency.  This is unheard of,  said Boris Gonzalez, 41, one of the aspiring Otro18 candidates, explaining they wanted to challenge the Communist Party from within the system. Otro18 spokesman Manuel Cuesta Morua said in an interview that its candidates had faced harassment and threats by state security forces for months and had been warned not to participate. The government has not responded to these accusations.    The Communist Party says it does not intervene in the elections, but a video circulating on social media of First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel, Raul Castro s probable successor, suggested otherwise.  There are six initiatives for the 2018 elections that seek to propose counter-revolutionaries as candidates,  Diaz-Canel told Communist Party cadres in the video.  We are taking steps to discredit all that.   In this battle, which we are already fighting, we are going to be involved in this whole process in the second half of the year,  he said. The government has not commented on the video. Cuba brands all dissenters as mercenaries funded by foreign governments and exiles, out to topple the government. Even if a few dissident candidates beat the odds and are elected to municipal assemblies, they have little chance of getting any further. The candidates for the provincial and national assemblies are nominated by commissions composed of representatives of Communist Party-controlled organizations such as the trade union federation and Committees in Defense of the Revolution. The slates have had the same number of names as seats in previous elections. Up to 50 percent of those names must be ward delegates. After the general election, the assemblies elect their respective executives and on Feb. 24 the new National Assembly is scheduled to name a new president and other members of the Council of State.  I have never voted for anyone important, not even our president,  said retired air force mechanic and staunch Castro-supporter Eduardo, who requested his last name not be used.  I can only vote for my neighborhood representative and they never go anywhere,  he said,  but I still think it s a better system than one based on money and lies.  ",0
"Irish PM says progress being made in Brexit border talks DUBLIN (Reuters) - Progress is being made in talks between Britain and the EU on how to avoid setting up a physical infrastructure on Northern Ireland s border after the United Kingdom leaves the EU in 2019, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Wednesday.  I think it is fair to say that progress is being made but not that is sufficient at this stage,  Varadkar told parliament.   We are not at a decision point at the moment. Things are changing on a daily basis and are rapidly evolving,  he said.   The EU has named the border as one of three issues on which  sufficient progress  must be made in order to allow progress to talks on a future trade agreement with Britain, crucial for British businesses.

"Senate intel panel to seek testimony from Trump Jr.: Senate source (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate’s intelligence committee is seeking documents from Donald Trump Jr. and intends to call on him to testify before lawmakers, a Senate source told Reuters on Tuesday after Trump Jr. released an email chain citing Russian support for his father before last year’s U.S. election.

"Senior Republican proposes more oversight of foreign lobbying WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, proposed a bill on Tuesday to overhaul disclosure rules regarding anyone working on behalf of a foreign government, a law that has received renewed attention after Paul Manafort was indicted for violating it.  The proposed legislation, called the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act, would close loopholes in the Foreign Agents Registration Act and require the Department of Justice to develop a strategy for enforcing the law, the Republican senator said in a statement.  Manafort, a longtime Republican operative who briefly served as Donald Trump’s campaign manager in 2016, and his business associate Rick Gates, pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment that contained charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. The current law, known as FARA, requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign government or political party to disclose to the Department of Justice their work as well as public communications taken on behalf of that client.  Critics have argued the reporting requirements for FARA are unclear and contains loopholes that allow American lobbyists to avoid disclosure of their foreign clients. “Congress passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act to prevent inappropriate influence in domestic policy, but my oversight work has uncovered rampant disregard by foreign agents and lackluster enforcement by federal authorities,” Grassley said in a statement.   The proposed law would clarify who is required to register, improve investigative tools, including granting authority for the Justice Department to pursue civil charges, and create new reporting requirements. FARA was first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War II in an effort to combat German propaganda efforts and was later amended in 1966 to include lobbyists, according to the Department of Justice. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Grassley is empowered to see that the bill quickly receives a hearing and a vote. ",0
"New York Road Runners to Extend Doping Tests to Lower-Tier Races - The New York Times One of the nation’s largest road racing organizations plans to expand its testing for   drugs to include the top runners in its local races, not just those in its   events. For more than a decade, the organization, New York Road Runners, has tested elite runners in the New York City Marathon, its largest and   race, and its other professional events. Runners found to have cheated are disqualified, and their prize money is withheld. Runners who previously tested positive for   drugs are ineligible to run. The new effort, scheduled to begin in the spring of 2017, will test the top local and club runners  —   the tier below the level of   professionals. It is part of the organization’s efforts to ensure a level playing field at more of its races while increasing awareness of the dangers of using   drugs. “It’s meant for guys running up front in the local races,” said Peter Ciaccia, the president of events at New York Road Runners and the race director of the marathon, the largest in the country. “The idea is to just throw out a wider net. ” New York Road Runners already spends $100, 000 a year testing its professional runners. That money covers the cost of setting up secure areas to obtain samples and shipping them to laboratories to be analyzed, a process that takes about six weeks. The organization’s officials also monitor race results to see if any runners run noticeably faster over a short time. The group will spend another $100, 000 or so in the first year to expand its testing program. As it does with its professional runners, the organization will pay the United States   Agency to randomly select a small group of top local runners to be tested at races. Road Runners awards about $130, 000 a year in prize money to members and club runners in its local races. Any runners in that category who test positive will forfeit their prize money. When they register for races, runners must sign waivers in which they agree to be tested, if chosen. Runners can appeal a positive test result. They can also apply for a   exemption if they take medicine that may contain banned ingredients. Ciaccia said the decision to expand testing had not been driven by a specific instance of a runner’s being caught taking a banned substance. Instead, he said, his organization wants to alert runners of all ages to the dangers of   drugs. “It’s not just about the brand integrity, but also the educational component so young kids understand what they might get themselves into,” he said. Antidoping experts applauded the effort. “It’s always worth extending the testing experience, that’s for sure,” said Dr. Don Catlin, the former director of the U. C. L. A. Olympic Analytical Laboratory. “There’s a limited number of tests done for events, so it’s always best to increase the numbers and get runners tested more. ” In a statement, Travis T. Tygart, the chief executive of Usada, said he hoped more sports organizations would follow the club’s lead. “It’s fantastic and shows great commitment and leadership to ensuring a level playing field, where clean athletes can compete clean and win,” he said. Club runners in the New York area said that the hassle of extra testing was a small price to pay to weed out potential cheaters, no matter how few there were and how little the prize money. “I very much think drug testing has to be part of the sport at almost every level,” said John Roberts, the president of the Central Park Track Club, who was briefed on New York Road Runners’ plans. “It’s unfortunate that that’s where things have gotten. But I can’t think of any reason not to do it, except inconvenience. ” The extra time spent analyzing the test results, though, is likely to increase the time it takes to distribute prize money, something that concerns runners who already wait for months to receive checks from the club. “It takes months for them to pay out $500 in prize money, so it will now take longer,” said William du Pont Staab Jr. the president of the West Side Runners Club. “Our runners, they can use their money for their rent. ”",0
"How Big Banks Are Putting Rain Forests in Peril - The New York Times In early 2015, scientists monitoring satellite images at Global Forest Watch raised the alarm about the destruction of rain forests in Indonesia. Environmental groups raced to the scene in West Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo, to find a charred wasteland: smoldering fires, orangutans driven from their nests, and signs of an extensive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. “There was pretty much no forest left,” said Karmele Llano Sánchez, director of the nonprofit International Animal Rescue’s orangutan rescue group, which set out to save the endangered primates. “All the forest had burned. ” Fingers pointed to the Rajawali Group, a sprawling local conglomerate known for its ties to powerful politicians like Malaysia’s   prime minister. But lesser known is how some of the world’s largest banks have helped Rajawali  —   and other global agricultural powerhouses  —   expand their plantation empires. The year before the clearing of trees in West Kalimantan, Rajawali’s plantation arm secured $235 million in loans  —   funds that the Indonesian company used to buy out a partner and bolster its landholdings  —   from banks including Credit Suisse and Bank of America, according to an examination of lending data by The New York Times. The deal forms part of at least $43 billion in loans and underwriting to companies linked to deforestation and forest burning in Southeast Asia alone, according to a tally compiled by the   Rainforest Action Network, the Dutch consultancy Profundo and the Indonesian nongovernmental organization TuK Indonesia. More than a third of that sum comes from American, European and Japanese banks, many of which have sustainability pledges that specifically mention deforestation. That figure is almost certainly incomplete because not all financing is made public. It also excludes loans made by the same banks to forestry projects outside Southeast Asia, or financing provided to other, more global players. And it contrasts with efforts by companies like Nestlé and Procter  Gamble to distance themselves from suppliers linked to deforestation. And while there has been a growing movement among endowments and pension funds to divest from the   industry  —   and banks have started to back away from financing coal projects  —   any move away from deforestation has been slower to catch on, experts say. The role of banks has come under the spotlight in recent weeks after environmentalists called out banks like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs for financing the contentious Dakota Access oil pipeline project. The money is aiding a process that scientists say destroys ecosystems, displaces indigenous communities and covers the region each year in a thick, suffocating smog that stretches from Jakarta to Hong Kong. Deforestation  —   and the fires that frequently accompany it  —   also generates   of total global warming emissions, making forestry loss one of the biggest single contributors to global warming, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Destroying the world’s forests makes fighting climate change almost impossible,” said Andrew W. Mitchell, executive director of the Global Canopy Programme, a forestry think tank. “The finance sector is really lagging behind in realizing that. ” In funding Rajawali’s palm oil plantations, the banks appear to have violated their own sustainability policies. In its forestry and agribusiness policy, adopted in 2008, Credit Suisse says it will not finance or advise companies with operations in “primary tropical moist forests” like those of West Kalimantan. Bank of America says in a banking policy, adopted in 2004, that it will not finance commercial projects that result in the clearing of primary tropical moist forests. The 2014 deal financed Rajawali’s expansion into palm oil by helping the conglomerate buy out a former partner, invest in new palm oil mills and increase its landholdings. Demand for palm oil is surging worldwide, driven by rising incomes in markets like China and India and a switch away from trans fats by Americans and Europeans. Rajawali’s plantations have been accused by environmental and labor groups of deforestation and illegal burning. Indonesia is one of the world’s biggest palm oil producers, and forestry loss there and elsewhere ranks as one of the biggest single contributors to global warming. Sebastian Sharp, a spokesman for Rajawali’s plantation arm, acknowledged that the burning and clearing on its West Kalimantan forest sites might be illegal but said local communities encroaching on its properties and starting the fires were to blame. He said the company did not engage in illegal burning or clearing. Credit Suisse declined to comment on its Rajawali deal or to say whether the deal violated its sustainability policies. A Bank of America spokesman, Bill Halldin, said that the most serious accusations against Rajawali came after the 2014 loan, in which the bank played “a very small role. ” “Today, we would certainly consider more information before making any decision on any client,” he said. Brigitte Seegers, a spokeswoman for ABN Amro, declined to comment. Climate concerns have been brought into sharp relief by the impending presidency of Donald J. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax. Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a commitment by 195 countries to take concrete measures to reduce   carbon emissions. Daily emissions from Indonesia’s forest fires last year at times exceeded emissions produced by all economic activity in the United States. A recent Harvard and Columbia study estimated that the fires caused at least 100, 000 premature deaths across Southeast Asia. The World Bank estimates that the fires cost Indonesia’s economy $16 billion. Although deforestation has slowed in many parts of the world, notably in the Brazilian Amazon, forest clearing is on the rise in Southeast Asia. Indonesia, in particular, suffers the world’s highest rates of forest loss, an average of almost 2. 1 million acres a year, a study published in 2014 found. About 15 percent of the world’s historical forest cover remains intact, according to the World Resources Institute. The rest has been cleared or degraded or is in fragments. Rajawali originally operated its palm plantation business, Green Eagle Holdings, as a joint venture with the French conglomerate Louis Dreyfus. But starting in 2014, Rajawali took the first step to consolidate the palm oil business under its control, and invest in new infrastructure. Its loans from Western banks were crucial. In January 2014, Green Eagle attracted a $120 million loan from a group of lenders led by ABN Amro. In July of that year, it scored an even bigger loan of $235 million from a syndicate led by Credit Suisse. Bank of America also took part in that loan. The financing allowed Green Eagle to buy out Louis Dreyfus to invest in new palm oil mills and increase its landholdings. In November 2014, Green Eagle merged with another plantation operator, BW Plantation Rajawali is majority shareholder of the resulting company, Eagle High Plantations. The banks issued those loans as Rajawali was being accused of extensive forest and peatland destruction, illegal burning, use of child labor and the use of force against workers at plantations under its control.   mapping by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and satellite imagery from Global Forest Watch, show forest loss at two sites in West Kalimantan from 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, with much of the forest gone by the end of the year. Those sites included around 11, 000 hectares of peat, which, when set alight, can smolder for months underground. Zamzami, who goes by one name, a Greenpeace staff member in Indonesia who visited a Rajawali plantation in West Kalimantan in September 2015, said the burning continued. “It was difficult to breathe because of the smoke,” he said in field notes. “Far away, on the horizon, I could see the forest wall. ” Eagle High is now one of Indonesia’s largest palm oil plantation operators, with more than a million acres in land rights under its control, according to an investors’ presentation dated September 2014. Human rights organizations have reported that children as young as 6 work to support their parents in another   plantation in the Papua province. That plantation has promised to support the abolition of child labor by ensuring that there are no children on plantation sites. In December 2015, a    worker was shot dead at the plantation by state security forces. It was unclear why state forces were on private property. Mr. Sharp, the Eagle High spokesman, blamed local villagers for the forest clearing and burning on its sites. “It’s being done by local communities, and we have no control over that,” he said. Environmental groups argue that plantation companies are responsible for protecting their sites. Mr. Sharp said that there were instances in which workers brought their children to plantations but that the company was “trying to brainstorm ways in which we can stop them from doing that. ” He also questioned the wisdom of Indonesian labor law. “Why can’t we hire children at 15? Families need income,” he said. Under the country’s law, the minimum age for hazardous work, including jobs on plantations, is 18. The worker who was killed, Marvel Doga, was “drunk and violent, poured petrol everywhere and threatened to set fire, and he had with him a bow and arrow” when nearby state security forces tried to incapacitate him, leading to his death, Mr. Sharp said. He said Eagle High paid “thousands of dollars” to his family in compensation. Credit Suisse and ABN Amro declined to discuss specific deals. Bank of America declined to comment on the accusations. But in a February 2015 research note, Credit Suisse deemed Rajawali’s palm oil push a success. Eagle High’s increased landholdings and land rights signaled “significant headroom for expansion” of palm oil production, Priscilla Tjitra, an equity analyst for the bank, said in a report to clients. “The allocation of finance is so influential in our economy and to our environment,” said Tom Picken of the Rainforest Action Network. “But there’s little way we can hold financial sectors to account. ” The orangutan rescues continue. The world has lost 60 percent of its population of Bornean orangutans since 1950, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In July, the Bornean orangutan was listed as critically endangered. International Animal Rescue, which runs a temporary shelter for about 100 orangutans in West Kalimantan, said its staff had rescued roughly 50 of the primates during the 2015 burning season, twice the number the organization rescues in an average year. “They were all starving, all skinny,” said Ms. Sánchez, the orangutan rescue group’s director. So far this year, about 25 orangutans have been rehabilitated. “The problem is that every time an area is destroyed and orangutans are under real threat, we have to look for areas to release them, and that’s challenging,” she said. “We’re running out of places where we can release these orangutans. ” In September, Rajawali’s plantation arm secured a $192 million loan from Bank Negara Indonesia, a state bank, to refinance the debt held by its plantation subsidiaries and to double the capacity of palm oil refineries in Papua and West Kalimantan. Bank Negara Indonesia’s sustainability policies say that its clients must adopt “minimum environmental, social and governance standards. ” The bank did not respond to requests for comment.",0

"White House official says North Korea is test for U.S.-China relations WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will discuss how to rein in North Korea’s nuclear program with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week in what a senior White House official said on Tuesday would be a test for the U.S.-Chinese relationship. Trump and Xi are to meet on Thursday and Friday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago retreat on the Atlantic coast in Palm Beach, Florida. It will be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump took office on Jan. 20, and trade and security issues are to figure prominently in their talks. “We would like to work on North Korea together,” the official said in a briefing for reporters. “This is a test for the relationship.” Trump wants China to do more to exert its economic influence over unpredictable Pyongyang to restrain its nuclear and missile programs, while Beijing has said it does not have that kind of influence. In an interview with the Financial Times last weekend, Trump held out the possibility of using trade as a lever to secure Chinese cooperation. In the same interview, Trump was quoted as telling the FT that Washington was ready to address the North Korean threat alone, if need be. The White House official — speaking just as North Korea fired a projectile believed by South Korea’s military to be a ballistic missile into the sea — said the situation had become more urgent. “The clock is very, very quickly running out,” the official said. “All options are on the table for us.” Trump does not plan to give in to Chinese pressure for the United States to withdraw its THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea, which Beijing considers destabilizing. Trump has said he expects the meeting to be a difficult one given his belief that China has taken advantage of U.S. trade policies to help its economy and hurt U.S. job creation. He plans to discuss with Xi a new “elevated” and streamlined framework for a U.S.-Chinese dialogue with “clear deadlines for achieving results,” the senior White House official said. He will discuss significant trade and economic concerns with Xi in what the official called a “candid and productive manner.” ",0
"Mexico says upcoming U.S. execution of national is 'illegal' MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Senior Mexican diplomats on Monday condemned the upcoming execution of a Mexican inmate on death row in Texas, calling his sentence  illegal  and vowing to exhaust all possible efforts to prevent him from being killed later this week. In a news conference in Mexico City, Carlos Sada, Mexico s deputy foreign minister for North America, told reporters that Texas prosecutors did not follow due process in the case of Ruben Cardenas, who was sentenced to death for raping and killing his 15-year-old cousin in 1997.  From the start, there has been a failure, and from our perspective, this is an illegal act,  Sada said. The planned execution comes as relations between Mexico and the United States are at a low, hurt by U.S. President Donald Trump s vows to build a wall along the Mexican border, and his threats to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Cardenas, who is due to die on Wednesday, was not given the chance to speak with consular officials in contravention of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Sada said. He added Mexico would look to stay the execution by seeking to overturn how Cardenas  confession was obtained, while also looking to exonerate him with up-to-date DNA testing. There are currently two separate appeals under way and Mexico is willing to take Cardenas  case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary, Sada added. Mexico does not have the death penalty and opposes it, regularly clashing with the United States when Mexican nationals are set to be executed on U.S. soil. Sada said 54 Mexicans were currently facing U.S. death sentences.  The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague ruled in 2004 that the United States had violated international law by failing to inform 51 Mexicans now on death row of their right to consular assistance, and said the cases should be reviewed. Alejandro Alday, a legal advisor to the Mexican government, said Cardenas was one of the 51 covered by the ICJ ruling, and accused Texas of breaching the Vienna convention in failing to advise Cardenas of his right to consular assistance.

"Khamenei says Iran will 'shred' nuclear deal if U.S. quits it ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would stick to its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would  shred  the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported. Khamenei spoke five days after U.S. President Donald Trump adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the deal, reached under Trump s predecessor Barack Obama, and saying he might ultimately terminate it.  I don t want to waste my time on answering the rants and whoppers of the brute (U.S.) president,  Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran quoted by state television.  Trump s stupidity should not distract us from America s  deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the deal, we will shred it ... Everyone should know that once again America will receive a slap in its mouth and will be defeated by Iranians.  Trump s move put Washington at odds with other parties to the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - who say Washington cannot unilaterally cancel an international accord enshrined by a U.N. resolution.  Khamenei, who has the final say on Iran s state matters,  welcomed European support but said it was not sufficient.   European states stressed their backing for the deal and condemned Trump ... We welcomed this, but it is not enough to ask Trump not to rip up the agreement. Europe needs to stand against practical measures (taken) by America.  Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly certified Tehran s compliance with the terms. Trump accuses Iran of supporting terrorism and says the 2015 deal does not do enough to block its path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran says it does not seek nuclear arms and in turn blames the growth of militant groups such as Islamic State on the policies of the United States and its regional allies.     In decertifying the nuclear deal last week, Trump gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact. In a major shift in U.S. policy, Trump also said Washington will take a more confrontational approach to Iran over its ballistic missile program and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East. Tehran has repeatedly pledged to continue what it calls a defensive missile capability in defiance of Western criticism. The United States has said Iran s stance violates the 2015 deal in spirit as missiles could be tipped with nuclear weapons. Tehran has said it seeks only civilian nuclear energy from its enrichment of uranium, and that the program has nothing to do with missile development efforts.  EU foreign ministers on Monday urged U.S. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on Tehran but also discussed Iran s missile program, which they want to see dismantled.  They must avoid interfering in our defense program ... We do not accept that Europe sings along with America s bullying and its unreasonable demands,  Khamenei said.   They (Europeans) ask why does Iran have missiles? Why do you have missiles yourselves? Why do you have nuclear weapons?       The Trump administration has imposed new unilateral sanctions targeting Iran s missile activity. It has called on Tehran not to develop missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Iran says it has no such plans. Iran has one of the biggest ballistic missile programs in the Middle East, viewing it as an essential precautionary defense against the United States and other adversaries, primarily Gulf Arab states and Israel.  Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region,  Khamenei said.  Supporters of the deal fear Trump s decision to decertify the deal could eventually unravel it, causing more tension in the crisis-hit Middle East, where Shi ite Iran is involved in a decades long proxy war with U.S. ally Sunni Saudi Arabia.  If the deal falls apart, Iran s anti-Western hardliners will gain authority in a backlash against pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani, who engineered the accord to help end Iran s political and economic isolation, analysts and insiders say.

"Myanmar says U.S. sanctions against general based on 'unreliable accusations' (Reuters) - Myanmar  feels sad  over a U.S. decision to sanction a military general, a government spokesman said, after Washington linked the commander last week to abuses against the Rohingya Muslim minority.  This targeted sanction is based on unreliable accusations without evidence, as we have repeatedly said, so we feel sad for that,  Zaw Htay, spokesman for Myanmar s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, told Reuters by phone late on Tuesday. The Trump administration announced on Dec. 21 that it was sanctioning Major General Maung Maung Soe, who was in charge of a crackdown on the Rohingya minority in the western state of Rakhine. The United States, as well as the United Nations, have called the crackdown  ethnic cleansing . About 655,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine state and sought shelter over the border in Bangladesh, according to the United Nations.  The United States said American officials had  examined credible evidence of Maung Maung Soe s activities, including allegations against Burmese security forces of extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, and arbitrary arrest as well as the widespread burning of villages . The military and the civilian government of Suu Kyi have denied allegations of widespread abuse in Rakhine.  The testimonies of Rohingya refugees were only  talking stories , Zaw Htay said, adding that Myanmar would act if it received  reliable and strong evidence  that its troops committed crimes.  We have told international governments and human rights groups including the U.N. that the current government is committed to protecting and promoting human rights,  said Zaw Htay. The U.S. Treasury said Maung Maung Soe, former chief of the army s Western Command, would have his U.S. assets frozen and Americans could no longer deal with him. Reuters was unable to determine if Maung Maung Soe had business interests in Myanmar or elsewhere. Maung Maung Soe was transferred from his post in Rakhine and  put in reserve , an army spokesman told Reuters on Nov. 13. No reason was given, but the military said the same day action would be taken against officials who were  weak in acquiring information  and who allowed the militant Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) to spread through Muslim villages in Rakhine. Reuters was unable to contact Maung Maung Soe. Major General Tun Tun Nyi of the military s public relations division, the True News Information Unit, said he had no comment on the sanctions and declined to answer questions on Maung Maung Soe. As well as dominating the country s politics for decades, Myanmar s army - known as the Tatmadaw or  Royal Force  - has gained notoriety for brutal counter-insurgency tactics employed against rebels seeking autonomy in the borderlands since independence from Britain in 1948, according to historians and human rights monitors.  But since it began ceding power in 2011 - albeit under a constitution that keeps soldiers in key posts - the army has sought to burnish its image as a modern fighting force. It has defended its actions in Rakhine, with military investigators concluding that troops adhered to rules of engagement and sought to minimize civilian casualties while responding to  terrorist  provocations. But the spiraling Rohingya crisis has dashed hopes of expanding engagement with Western armies, Andrew Selth, an academic who has researched Myanmar s armed forces, wrote in September.  This is a significant loss for the Tatmadaw, which is keen to learn about foreign military policies and practices,  Selth wrote on the website of the Sydney-based Lowy Institute.  Such contacts would have also helped its officers learn about international norms of behavior and the role of armed forces in democracies.  Myanmar s military does not provide detailed biographies of senior officers. In February last year, a state media report said Maung Maung Soe was a brigadier general in the far south of the country, near the border with Thailand. He was referred to as a major general in charge of the military s Western Command in October, 2016, shortly after ARSA attacked three border posts there, killing nine guards. In the weeks after the attacks, Rohingya villagers told Reuters of gang rapes by soldiers and extrajudicial killings. Two military sources told Reuters that Maung Maung Soe oversaw battalions Nos. 352, 551, 564 and 345, which led the so-called  clearance operations , and he reported directly to a Bureau of Special Operations in the capital Naypyitaw. His forces were again in combat following more widespread ARSA attacks on Aug. 25 this year, although troops from elite units that report straight to Naypyitaw were airlifted into Rakhine ahead of those attacks. New York-based Human Rights Watch said in October that Battalion 564 was identified by villagers as taking part in an alleged massacre of scores of people in the village of Maung Nu, close to the unit s base in the Buthidaung area. The day Maung Maung Soe s replacement as the commander in Rakhine was announced, the military released a report saying its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities, including in Buthidaung.

"Pennsylvania Attorney General Quits on Heels of Perjury Conviction - The New York Times Even by Pennsylvania’s unbuttoned standards, it was a scandal of exhausting length and tawdriness, a seemingly endless parade of pornography, personal and political vendettas, smear tactics, barely veiled threats, conspiracy and  . So when the state’s attorney general, Kathleen G. Kane, announced on Tuesday that she was resigning, one day after her conviction for perjury and conspiracy, among other charges, even her supporters might have been excused for welcoming a sense of closure. Except that the scandal is not closed, not yet. More than two years after it began, the Kane affair may have a few more shoes to drop from its   closet of improprieties. Ms. Kane, who had weathered indictment, the loss of her law license, threats of State House impeachment and Senate removal and a plea to resign from her fellow Democrat, Gov. Tom Wolf, said she would leave office on Wednesday, less than three months before voters will choose her successor. The announcement followed a jury’s decision to convict her on nine criminal charges, saying she had leaked secret grand jury information to a newspaper to discredit a rival prosecutor, Frank Fina, and then lied about it under oath. The first deputy attorney general, Bruce Castor, who has in effect run Ms. Kane’s office the last few months, said Tuesday that investigators were still working on the most lurid aspect of the scandal: a trove of lewd pictures and sexist and racist comments that Ms. Kane discovered when she exhumed emails of her Republican predecessor’s staff. He said that a law firm that Ms. Kane had hired to sift through the emails was flummoxed by the sheer number of them  —   13 million, later winnowed to seven million by tossing out the correspondence of   officials. The emails, which did not come up at Ms. Kane’s trial but some of which have trickled out of her office, have led to the resignation of two State Supreme Court justices and a bevy of other officials, with the prospect of more embarrassment to come. Douglas P. Gansler, the lawyer hired to lead the investigation, said Tuesday that he expected to release a report on the inquiry “in the next few weeks. ” The chairman of the state Democratic Party, Marcel Groen, said Tuesday that he believed the most salacious correspondence had already become public  —   and then, in an indication of just how dire the scandal has been, suggested that the emails were the lesser of the problems. “There’s a difference between inappropriate behavior by elected officials and illegal behavior,” he said. “I think the emails are inappropriate, and they’re wrong, but I don’t think they’re illegal, per se. ” They nevertheless played a starring role in the affair. And they may turn out to be Ms. Kane’s last word in a scandal that began with her desire to ruin a competitor, and wound up destroying her own career. Ms. Kane, 50, was hailed at the state’s most promising politician when she became the first Democrat to be elected attorney general in 2012. But she antagonized her Republican predecessor by opening an investigation into his office’s handling of the   scandal at Penn State. After an article in The Philadelphia Inquirer suggested that she had improperly shut down a sting operation that had documented payments accepted by several   Democrats, Ms. Kane concluded that Mr. Fina, who was deeply involved in the Penn State case, had smeared her. She struck back, giving The Philadelphia Daily News grand jury documents that left the impression Mr. Fina had mishandled a 2009 inquiry into grants given another politician. Mr. Fina demanded a criminal investigation of the grand jury leak, and that led to Ms. Kane’s indictment, followed by an extraordinary   defense in which she claimed to have been framed by an “old boys’ group” that was involved in the email imbroglio  —   and wanted to stop more emails from surfacing. The scandal plumbed the depths of skulduggery in a state whose record of corruption is not proud. In one instance, an aide to Ms. Kane was convicted of intercepting email traffic from the grand jury investigating her. In another, Mr. Fina was found to have secured a court order barring Ms. Kane from releasing any “personal” emails. At another low point, the state’s chief justice was accused of trying to rig an inquiry into another justice’s receipt of lewd emails. Over it all hung Ms. Kane’s implicit threat that more damning emails were in the wings. Whether citizens will regain respect for law enforcement and Pennsylvania politics at this point is a tough call. The Senate majority leader, Jake Corman, said he was looking for the bright side. “I often joke, ‘Thank God for Illinois,’” he said, referring to a state with its own corruption superlatives.",0
"Grassley and Feinstein: The Pair Who Will Lead Gorsuch’s Senate Hearings - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   She is a female trailblazer in a Senate where women remain a minority, a formal and wealthy institutionalist from one of the nation’s most liberal states whose partisanship is at times eclipsed by propriety. He is a   Midwesterner who has long prided himself on his   with officials from both parties in Washington and a compulsive availability to voters back home, with a reputation for thrift perhaps best validated by his habit of cutting the engine on his car as he rolls it into the Senate garage, just to save on gas. What neither Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, nor Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has is a law degree. Yet as the   Democrat and the chairman on the Senate Judiciary Committee, they will preside over the hearings on Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, that begin on Monday. Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Grassley, both 83, will face tremendous pressure from their respective parties to deliver a vindication of their views not just of Judge Gorsuch’s worthiness to serve on the court but also of the process leading him there. Liberal activists remain bitter about Mr. Grassley’s role in preventing even a beginning to the confirmation process of Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia more than a year ago. Many are looking to Ms. Feinstein  —   the first woman to serve on the committee and the Senate’s most senior woman  —   to shoulder the weight of that political burden, and to rigorously challenge Judge Gorsuch on his constitutional views. “This is an important process that needs to be carried out with the kind of dignity and perseverance that it warrants,” Ms. Feinstein said. “Because this is so pivotal, as the decisive vote on the court, this is a huge responsibility. This is complicated by what came before, which was the Republican treatment of Merrick Garland, which I found very disagreeable and unprecedented. ” Mr. Grassley’s role is strategically and procedurally easier: It is up to him to make Judge Gorsuch’s week on Capitol Hill painless even in the face of tough questioning from Democrats on the committee. “His approach to the hearing will likely mirror what we have seen in recent weeks back here,” Matt Strawn, a former chairman of Iowa’s Republican Party, said of Mr. Grassley. “He has given Iowans every opportunity to weigh in on town hall meetings. There is a reason he is our   public servant here because he listens and is respectful even if he disagrees with someone. ” Mr. Grassley has been a strong defender of the most conservative of the 13 nominees he has voted for, but he also helped approve Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg under President Bill Clinton. Ms. Feinstein has never voted for a Republican nominee. Mr. Grassley’s reputation for independence took a hit when he instantly went along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to block Judge Garland from even a single hearing last year. “I’m not sensitive talking about it,” Mr. Grassley said. “I had to defend my position  —   I had to defend it up to my election. ” He added that he believed it was appropriate to wait for a new president to approve a new Supreme Court nominee, saying, “I would do the same thing in 2020. ” But both senators, who express respect for each other, have a reputation for a seriousness that transcends party politics, an increasingly rare trait in the modern Congress. They are the leaders of a caucus dedicated to combating the narcotics trade. “These days there are immense party pressures that will push Chuck, that will push Dianne,” said former Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat of Montana who served as a chairman with Mr. Grassley on the Senate Finance Committee. “But they will both try to do the right thing. ” Mr. Grassley, who was first elected to the Senate in 1980, has served on the Judiciary Committee for his entire tenure. He has concerned himself principally with victims’ rights, civil asset forfeiture and justice for older people. Long an opponent of criminal justice reform, he has evolved toward modest changes in recent years. He is a fierce advocate for all things Iowa and tends to bring that sensibility to policy debates, rushing home on weekends to spend time with voters. His Twitter account (search for “assume deer dead”) is among the most followed on Capitol Hill for its folksy charm. He is a tireless worker  —   beginning most days with a predawn jog  —   and a mentor to younger members. Mr. Baucus said they would meet weekly when they served on the Finance Committee together, promoting a sense of bipartisanship. Mr. McConnell said of Mr. Grassley, “This a man who commands respect from both Democrats and Republicans. ” He added, “We’ll see that on display next week. ” Ms. Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992, in the wake of the Clarence Thomas hearings, which underscored the maleness of the Judiciary Committee. Joseph R. Biden Jr. then a senator, asked Ms. Feinstein and Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois to be barrier breakers on the panel. “I took that to be a very big honor,” Ms. Feinstein said. Ms. Feinstein’s particular place among senior female senators can be viewed at times through the prism of the issues she champions. During a debate over language concerning abortion in a 2015 human trafficking bill, Ms. Feinstein took to the Senate floor to extemporaneously and passionately explain her position. Saying that women had experienced “loss after loss” on abortion rights, she said, “I am old enough to have seen the way it was before, to have sentenced women who committed illegal abortions with coat hangers. ” Her position can also be seen when she feels the sting of condescension. In 2013, during a hearing on gun control, she famously sparred with Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, as he lectured her about the Constitution. “I’m not a sixth grader, senator,” she told Mr. Cruz, then a Senate newcomer. “I’ve been on this committee for 20 years. ” Former Representative Ellen Tauscher, Democrat of California and a longtime friend of Ms. Feinstein’s, said, “I do think that women do quickly calibrate where we are going to find a navigation problem. ” She added, “She is now the senior woman senator, and she takes that very seriously. ” Mr. Grassley sees his role similarly and does not consider the absence of a law degree an inherent liability. “I don’t know the nuances of everything that lawyers talk about,” he said. “But I do think you pick up an appreciation for the law and how to approach the law and some vague understanding of constitutional law. ” He added, “I’d probably feel more comfortable if I were a lawyer, but I am telling you, as a farmer, I feel comfortable. ” Ms. Feinstein has been spending weekends poring over thick binders of Judge Gorsuch’s decisions, discussing them with her daughter, a retired Superior Court judge. “I think I have a good sense of him,” the senator said. Mr. Grassley said he had relied more on staff briefings and secondary sources about Judge Gorsuch’s record. “The guy is so precise,” he said. “I suppose because he’s an intellect and partly because it’s legal and me not being a lawyer, I found looking at some of his cases kind of difficult to get through. ” Ms. Feinstein said she appreciated Mr. Grassley’s candor. “He tells you exactly what he thinks,” she said. “Some people are full of artifice, and you never get to what they think. Also, he is a very good man. ”",0
"Highlights From the Clinton Campaign Emails: How to Deal With Sanders and Biden - The New York Times The latest trove of documents released by WikiLeaks includes thousands of pages of emails between John D. Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, and aides, Clinton family members and outside donors all angling for position and power within Mrs. Clinton’s   campaign. Last week, a set of Mr. Podesta’s emails were disclosed that included potentially damaging excerpts from private paid speeches Mrs. Clinton delivered to Wall Street executives in which she praised “open trade and open borders” and lamented that her personal wealth made her “kind of far removed” from the struggles of the middle class. The latest leaked emails show Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides trying to grapple with that reality, and establish a campaign message that could position her, a career politician and Washington insider, as an appealing agent of change. The authenticity of the emails, which were from Mr. Podesta’s account, was not challenged by Glen Caplin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. Here are the highlights: Despite statements by Mrs. Clinton and her allies insisting she had not made up her mind about seeking the presidency in 2016, the emails reveal that her advisers had begun to test messages and contemplate a campaign strategy at least two years before she officially declared her candidacy in April 2015. Mr. Podesta, who would become campaign chairman, and Robby Mook, the eventual campaign manager, grappled with how to best position Mrs. Clinton, a career politician, as a change agent, how much to play up the   potential of her candidacy and how to address anger over income inequality. “Gender will be a big field and volunteer motivator, but it won’t close the deal,” Mr. Mook wrote to Mr. Podesta and Cheryl D. Mills, another Clinton adviser, in March 2014. “The real challenge,” Ms. Mills wrote, “is that this likely will be when people want experience and we got so burned by that narrative” in the 2008 campaign against Barack Obama that “we won’t go back to it, even though it might be right for now. ” The emails reveal the excruciating   behind every step related to how Mrs. Clinton handled everything from her splashy campaign rollout speech on Roosevelt Island in June 2015 to a single Twitter post. In one email chain from March 2015, four aides debated a Twitter post in which Mrs. Clinton would address for the first time revelations that she had used a private email server during her tenure at the State Department. “I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” the post eventually read. “She smacked down POTUS on trade and kept kicking for a little bit,” Huma Abedin, a close aide, wrote on June 14, 2015, using an acronym for the president. “Worth looking at the transcript but this seemed to really work for this crowd. ” At the time, Mrs. Clinton was trying to craft herself as more of a populist, pointing to differences between her and Mr. Obama. The aides also liked the personal details she shared. “She inserted some new applause lines and talked about Dorothy,” her mother, “in a more personal way that I’ve only heard talk about privately,” Ms. Abedin wrote. Aides discussed leaking it after a meeting with labor leaders  —   so as not to undermine her “principled stand about not   the president in public. ” Mr. Mook suggested that Mrs. Clinton time her announcement to “help distract” from the barrage of criticism surrounding her use of a private email server. The emails show heightened awareness of her vulnerability to charges of   and political maneuvering. “She risks looking very political, especially on this,” wrote Joel Benenson, the chief strategist on the campaign. Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, felt that leaking her new position on Keystone “might achieve the same effect of getting her on the record on this issue, but with less perception that she is putting a finger to the wind. ” We take a closer look at how the debate over the unveiling evolved. In 2015, the Clinton campaign had to deal with escalating chatter about a potential run by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Donors phoned in reports on Mr. Biden’s    maneuvers to advisers like Neera Tanden, who relayed them back to Mr. Podesta. Steve Elmendorf, a longtime Clinton supporter, emailed her campaign manager to grouse about one supporter in particular: Linda Lipsen, head of the trial lawyers association. “I get multiple   calls every morning and I try to talk everyone off the ledge and not bug u all,” Mr. Elmendorf wrote. “But Linda is in a different category. ” Ms. Lipsen had complained about not getting enough care from the campaign at a time when she was working members of her trade association and trying to keep them from considering Mr. Biden. For all the planning, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides appeared blindsided by the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders’s populist message in the Democratic primary. Concern over Mrs. Clinton’s economic message seemed to reach a breaking point after Mrs. Clinton lost to Mr. Sanders by 22 percentage points in the New Hampshire primary. “Message needs to be more positive, upbeat, hopeful,” an adviser wrote to Mr. Podesta. “Bernie is saying we can change the world. Her msg is ‘No, we can’t’ because   …    ” The adviser expressed particular concern about young voters gravitating to Mr. Sanders’s promise for revolution. “Bernie’s ads feature young ppl saying why they are voting   supporting him,” she wrote. “Hillary’s ads need to be young people  —   all under 45 and a smattering of older ones  —   validating her. ” In January, Donna Brazile, a vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, passed on an email from Mr. Sanders’s   outreach team about how it was planning to host a   event. “Thank you for the heads up on this, Donna,” responded Adrienne Elrod, one of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides. Ms. Brazile, a longtime party operative, later replaced Debbie Wasserman Schultz on an interim basis as D. N. C. chairwoman on the eve of the party’s national convention, a change that came after leaked emails revealed that Democratic officials had conspired to harm Mr. Sanders’s bid for the party’s nomination. Her aides decided in January that she should avoid talking about Wall Street at an event in Nevada during her primary fight with Mr. Sanders. “Don’t know that it is most effective contrast for her,” wrote Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign’s communications director. “Seems like we are picking the fight he wants to have. ” In the fall and winter of 2011, an increasingly bitter dispute was breaking out between a top Clinton aide, Douglas J. Band, and Chelsea Clinton, over the blurred lines between the Clinton Foundation and Mr. Band’s consulting company, Teneo. Ms. Clinton had sought to reorganize and professionalize the foundation, angering Mr. Band and a fellow longtime Clinton aide, Justin Cooper, who resisted. “Doug apparently kept telling my dad I was trying to push him out, take over,” Ms. Clinton told Mr. Podesta in a November 2011 email. But the next month, Ms. Clinton was less understanding. In December, she emailed Mr. Podesta and several aides to Mrs. Clinton regarding a Clinton Foundation aide who worked for former President Bill Clinton. The aide, Ilya Aspis, had been calling members of Parliament in Britain “on behalf of President Clinton” for Teneo clients, including the chief executive of Dow Chemical. She also mentions that another former White House aide, Sara Latham, had begun working for Teneo but then quit “because she was so upset, partly because of what Doug and Declan asked her to   was happening for their clients at Davos. ” The reference appears to be to Declan Kelly, a   of Teneo, though what Ms. Latham was asked to do remains unclear.",0
"Lady Gaga Delivers Her Most Subversive Performance at Super Bowl Every entertainer likes to be subversive  —   to push the envelope and surprise their audience. At a time when Hollywood has made itself insufferable with its increasingly hysterical political commentary, Lady Gaga shocked the world simply by entertaining it. [Expectations were   before the Super Bowl LI halftime show what would Gaga  —   one of Hillary Clinton’s top celebrity supporters  —   say or do in this, the first halftime show of Donald Trump’s presidency? How could she possibly top Beyoncé’s   tribute to the Black Panthers from last year’s game?  “This performance is for everyone,” Gaga coyly told reporters in Houston on Saturday, refusing to divulge her plans. “I want to, more than anything, create a moment that everyone that’s watching will never forget. ” Tantalizing stuff. And yet there was barely a whiff of partisan politics at all during the pop star’s entire   set, not even a requisite “Resist,” or “Love trumps hate. ” Opening with a   of “God Bless America” and “This Land Is Your Land” from the roof of NRG Stadium under a cloud of pulsating red, white and   drones, Gaga literally dove into the building and straight into a collection of her greatest hits: “Poker Face,” “Just Dance,” “Born This Way,” “Telephone” and the grand finale of “Bad Romance,” all delivered   (a rare feat given the amount of dancing she was doing) and reasonably well.  It was a mesmerizing performance, filled with the kind of expert showmanship that only very confident artists can pull off. It reminded me, if only slightly, of Prince’s pageantry and   2007 halftime show in Miami, in which the late artist, ever the consummate entertainer, ran through a collection of Bob Dylan and Tina Turner covers before hoisting his guitar high for a rousing rendition of “Purple Rain,” in the middle of an actual downpour. Gaga did her set, and then it was over. No raised fists, no inappropriate language, no threats, no protests. No hysteria. She walked off the field after an epic exit in which she dropped the mic, caught a football and dove offstage, and then that stage was reset for what was to become one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the NFL. It is not unlikely  —   given the current political and cultural climate in America  —   that Gaga considered going the protest statement route, and then decided against it. After all, it is now firmly established that the endless political grandstanding has gotten celebrities absolutely nowhere. It rarely ever feels authentic, especially coming from people who earn more money in an hour for flashing their ass on TV than most Americans will earn in a lifetime. And even when it does feel authentic, millions across the country are bound to disagree. Conservative media, including yours truly, have made a cottage industry of pointing out exactly how clueless and out of touch celebrities are when compared with ordinary people. Just ask Hillary Clinton and her celebrity army how the last election worked out for them. And consider Beyoncé’s halftime show. For months afterward, the conversation was focused almost entirely on the blatant   enforcement message she preached from America’s biggest stage, and now, a year after the show and despite liberals’ claim that everybody loves Beyoncé! half the country now hates Beyoncé. Her show led police groups to boycott her concerts, even as she audaciously used a police escort to get to the game (and later cashed in on the   sentiment by offering her very own line of “Boycott Beyoncé” merchandise at her tour stops). More division. More disconnection between law enforcement and the people they serve and protect. All in the name of “love” and “tolerance. ” Or consider Madonna at last month’s Women’s March on Washington, where she casually suggested to the tens of thousands of activists in attendance that she had often thought of blowing up the White House. What did that do for us? Or Meryl Streep’s   speech about morality at the Oscars, as if Hollywood is somehow the great arbiter of moral behavior. The only thing Streep’s speech accomplished is that conservatives can no longer enjoy Kramer vs. Kramer in the same way again. The bottom line is this: the best way to unite more than 100 million Americans with wildly disparate political views is to refrain from making any political statements at all. That Lady Gaga was the one to buck the trend freaked out plenty of entertainment journalists and commentators. Could this be the same Gaga that hopped on a sanitation truck outside Trump Tower in the   hours of November 9, defiantly holding up a “Love Trumps Hate” sign in a show of silent protest? After the show, Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood wrote that the collection of hits Gaga played Sunday night “sounded like objects of distraction, catchy baubles meant to entertain us in the absence of a broader message. ” That sentiment was widely shared among Hollywood journalists, as a cursory look around the Internet revealed on Monday morning. Gaga missed her chance to say something useful, something revolutionary. This would have been The Moment, the chance to break through and show America just how stupid and wrong it was for electing Donald Trump president. Gaga would have found the key. To which I say: good grief. Pop songs are by definition catchy baubles meant to entertain us, and if Lady Gaga wanted to show off her maturity as an artist by performing a collection of her greatest hits (and converting some of the skeptics) then so be it. In the meantime, go masturbate to Meryl Streep’s acceptance speech and dream of better days.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
"Kremlin: we hope new U.S. envoy can help repair U.S.-Russia ties MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday it hoped that President Donald Trump’s new ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, could help breathe new life into battered U.S.-Russia relations.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov made the comments to reporters in a conference call ahead of Huntsman presenting his diplomatic credentials to President Vladimir Putin later on Tuesday. “We hope that, headed by the new ambassador, the U.S. diplomatic mission to Russia will be able to significantly contribute to repairing the damage done by Washington’s actions to our relations,” said Peskov. Former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, an experienced diplomat, was confirmed as ambassador by the U.S. Senate at the end of last month.  Huntsman takes on the post in Moscow as congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller investigate allegations that Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election on Trump’s behalf, as well as potential collusion with Moscow by Trump associates. Moscow denies such activity and Trump dismisses any talk of collusion. Huntsman said at his confirmation hearing that there was no question Russia interfered during the 2016 campaign. ",0
"Morocco's 'mule' women scratch a living on Spanish enclave border MELILLA, Spain (Reuters) - In a winding early-morning queue, Jemaa Laalaoua hunches over with 50 kg (110 lb) of kitchenware on her back, waiting to cross back into Morocco from the Spanish enclave of Melilla. The 41-year-old mother of eight is one of thousands of Moroccans who eke out a living by walking loads of merchandise from Melilla into the northern Moroccan province of Nador. Goods including metal kettles that Laalaoua was carrying are counted as personal luggage and are not taxed, allowing for a small mark-up when they are shipped on and sold on across Morocco.  On average, I earn about 70 dirhams ($7.40) per trip, carrying anywhere between 40 to 70 kg,  says Laalaoua.  But most days, we never know how much we will make.  The work is backbreaking and fraught with risk. Some traders have died in stampedes through the tight border crossing.  We say our prayers in the morning and brace for the day, not knowing if we will come out dead or alive,  Laalaoua says.  She lifts undergarments to display bruises on her leg from a Spanish Civil Guard s truncheon. She says she was beaten for attempting to advance towards the front of the queue. No one from the Civil Guard in Melilla was available to comment. When Laalaoua finally gets through the narrowly caged border crossing, she weaves through the crowd to drop off her cargo inside the bustling Beni Ansar market, before rushing back to a Melilla warehouse where she will load up for her last trip of the day.  Locals with an address in the Nador province are allowed to cross through into Melilla without a visa, but cannot spend more than a day in the Spanish enclave. They can cross for five hours a day, four days a week. In total, there are between 30,000-40,000 crossings daily, according to the Spanish border police.  The practice has been going on for decades. Before, it was dominated by single mothers known locally as  mule women , who struggled to make a living elsewhere.  But as unemployment has climbed, the women have increasingly found themselves in competition with young men. Each morning the women report to a boss who tasks them with transporting an assigned quantity of goods, coordinating with warehouse owners and shippers. By 5 a.m. crowds of hundreds swell to thousands, as people wait for Spanish guards to open the border gates. Male traders fight and women shout and scream as the jostle for a place in the crush. Most manage to make two or three crossings before the border shuts again.  The merchandise spans everything from simple household goods such as towels, toilet paper, and soap, to illicit wares including alcohol and plastic bags, which have been banned in Morocco since last year. Laalaoua lives nearly 27 km (17 miles) from the border, waking up at 2 a.m. to prepare for her commute, by foot then taxi or bus.  Her husband Mohammed Zoubah, 57, fell ill six years ago, forcing Laalaoua to become the primary breadwinner.  She s strong, she s protecting this household,  he says. May God bless her with patience.  ",0
"Trump says hopes for Cuban 'freedom' after Castro death WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday that his administration would “do all it can” once he takes office on Jan. 20 to help increase freedom and prosperity for Cuban people after the death of Fidel Castro. But his initial reaction to Castro’s death sidestepped whether the incoming president would make good on a threat made late in his White House campaign to reverse President Barack Obama’s moves to open relations with the Cold War adversary. Obama used his executive powers on a series of steps to ease trade, travel and financial restrictions against Cuba, arguing it was time to try diplomacy after the half-century-long economic embargo against Cuba had failed to shake the regime. Trump’s first statement on Cuba policy since the Nov. 8 election, issued from his Palm Beach, Florida, resort where he and his family were spending the weekend after the Thanksgiving holiday, did not address whether he would roll back Obama’s measures because of concerns about religious and political freedom in Cuba. “Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty,” Trump said in the statement.  “While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,” he said. Trump has just begun to fill out the top ranks of his national security team, and has not yet named his top diplomat - the secretary of state - who will play a major role in formulating policy on Cuba. He last week named Mauricio Claver-Carone, a political lobbyist who has strongly criticized Obama’s efforts to normalize relations with Cuba and supports maintaining the U.S. embargo against the island, to his transition team at the U.S. Treasury Department. The agency is responsible for enforcing U.S. trade and travel restrictions on Cuba. Claver-Carone is director of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy Political Action Committee. Claver-Carone was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. Trump’s initial statement was viewed by some to mark a softening from his rhetoric on Cuba policy late in the campaign, one U.S. intelligence official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “This may be one place where his business interests prod him to take a more pragmatic course, even if that angers the hard-core, anti-Castro elements of both parties,” the official told Reuters. A second U.S. official noted the foreign policy advisers Trump has named thus far are not known to have any particular interest in Cuba. That may mean Trump’s economic team will have more sway over Cuba policy, which could lead to a more pragmatic approach, the second official said. An aggressive policy by Trump would close off lucrative opportunities to U.S. businesses and hand them to European or Asian firms, and would hurt companies like American Airlines (AAL.O), due to start commercial flights to Havana on Monday for the first time in half a century. Trump - a New York businessman and former reality TV star with an unconventional approach to politics - started his campaign saying he was open to lifting the long-standing embargo on trade with Cuba. In January, he said on Fox News that he was in favor of “opening it up” with Cuba, but wanted a better “deal” than Obama had made, comments he repeated in a debate with Republican rivals in March. “I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba’s favor,” Trump said in March, saying he would “probably have the embassy closed” in Havana until a new deal was made. When Obama visited Cuba later that month, Trump said in an interview with CNN that he “probably” would continue to normalize economic and diplomatic relations with Cuba, and would even open a Trump hotel in Cuba if the conditions were right. “I think Cuba has certain potential, and I think it’s OK to bring Cuba into the fold, but you have to make a much better deal,” he said, noting he was worried Cuba would sue the United States for reparations for damage caused by its decades-long embargo on Cuba. Cuba policy was not part of a major foreign policy address Trump delivered in April. After he secured his party’s nomination, his position shifted to a more traditional Republican position. At a Miami rally in September, Trump said he would roll back Obama’s Cuban policy reforms unless Cuban leaders allowed religious freedom and freed political prisoners. “The next president can reverse them, and that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands,” Trump told supporters. His vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, also took a hard line. “Let me make you a promise,” Pence said in Miami just days before the election. “When Donald Trump is president of the United States, we will repeal Obama’s executive orders on Cuba.” On Saturday, Pence tweeted: “The tyrant Castro is dead. New hope dawns. We will stand with the oppressed Cuban people for a free and democratic Cuba. Viva Cuba Libre!” Trump will face pressure to reverse Obama’s orders on Cuba from a bloc of mostly Republican Cuban-American lawmakers that has worked to keep tight restrictions on trade and travel with Cuba for years. They believe Cuba’s government is still too repressive to ease economic and travel restrictions. “The dictator has died, but the dictatorship has not,” said U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American who ran against Trump to be the Republican presidential candidate. “The future of Cuba ultimately remains in the hands of the Cuban people, and now more than ever Congress and the new administration must stand with them against their brutal rulers and support their struggle for freedom and basic human rights.” But some Republicans want to continue with Obama’s opening. U.S. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a leading Republican anti-embargo voice, said on Saturday that “more frequent and consequential ties between Cubans and Americans” would more likely boost income and sap the strength of the Castro government. Democratic Congresswoman Kathy Castor, who represents a Tampa, Florida, district with a significant Cuban population, said she thinks Castro’s death could make it easier for the Trump administration to change its Cuba stance. “While Fidel Castro was alive, there was an emotional impediment for greater engagement” from the Cuban exile community in Miami, Castor told Reuters. “That emotional impediment now is gone,” she said.

"Cyprus says it plans to help defuse Lebanese crisis ATHENS (Reuters) - Cyprus on Wednesday said it would try to help defuse a crisis in neighboring Lebanon after Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri made an unexpected stopover on the island on Tuesday night. Cyprus announced the move shortly after Hariri shelved a decision to resign at the request of Lebanon s President Michel Aoun, easing an impasse that had stirred tensions around the Middle East. Hariri met Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades at Larnaca airport for about 45 minutes late on Tuesday on his way back to Lebanon, his first visit home since he unexpectedly announced on Nov. 4 he would resign in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia.   Our common objective is stability in Lebanon, stability in our area. Within this context... the President of the Republic will undertake some initiatives precisely to promote this objective; stability in Lebanon,  Cypriot government spokesman Nikos Christodoulides said. Christodoulides said Anastasiades s initiatives would be directed toward European Union and neighboring states, but was not more specific.  Cyprus is uniquely placed, as a member state of the European Union which also maintains excellent relations with all its neighbors. That (position) is broadly recognized and would allow us to work to achieve stability in Lebanon,  he said. The island, perched on the edge of the Middle East, is broadly considered a neutral safe haven in an otherwise volatile region. It took in thousands of Lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and successfully mediated an end to a 39-day siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem between Israeli forces and suspected Palestinian militants. On Tuesday Anastasiades received an invitation to visit Saudi Arabia, Christodoulides said. It was not immediately clear if it was connected to the crisis, though Cypriot government officials told Reuters the visit had been planned for some time. ",0
"The Smothers Brothers and the Birth of TV Buzz - The New York Times Fifty years ago right about now, two unassuming young brothers were standing in front of a CBS studio audience taping the first episode of their new variety show. They were also about to unleash the modern concept of television buzz, in a storm the likes of which the medium had not seen. They were the Smothers Brothers, Tom and Dick, and the    story of their show, “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,” is worth recalling 50 years on as a case study that may prove newly relevant as a president with a habit of attacking TV shows via Twitter settles into office. That first episode, taped in late January and broadcast Feb. 5, 1967, wasn’t incendiary, but some that came later were spectacularly so. The brothers inflamed CBS censors and segments of their audience by injecting sexual innuendo, drug references, religion and especially politics into the typically bland   format, drawing, in Season 3, a   firing. The story of the show can seem  . The brothers were delivering two things that every network today covets: a lot of attention and a young audience. Why kill that    goose? The answer lies in the newness of it all. In 1967, no one knew quite how to exploit controversy and   conversation the way   publicists do. The series was CBS’s latest effort to compete against “Bonanza,” the NBC staple that had owned Sunday nights for years. The brothers had a     stage act in which Tom, on guitar, played a dimwit, and Dick, on bass, was the straight man. The dynamic translated exceedingly well to TV. Dick Smothers, now 77, who lives in Florida and advocates fitness and balance programs for older people, was a bit surprised by the show’s popularity at first. “I didn’t think we sang that well,” he said. “Now I can see the genuineness, the whimsy that we had. ” The series was remarkable for its   approach, mixing established guest stars with newcomers and rock acts. A September 1967 installment had Bette Davis, Mickey Rooney and the Who, whose   finale that night is said to have damaged Pete Townshend’s hearing. The multigenerational lineups led to ratings success some weeks, the show even outdrew “Bonanza. ” But the humor content increasingly reflected contentious times, and by Season 2, clashes with CBS’s censors were frequent. “They had something to offend everybody,” William H. Tankersley, then the executive in charge of programming standards and practices at CBS, said in a 2001 interview with the Archive of American Television, still sounding peeved. (Mr. Tankersley died last year at 98.) “They brought more complaints than any show in history on CBS. They injected politics up to the sky. They refused to do anything that we asked. ” The CBS response, though, was oddly inconsistent, evidence of how uncharted this territory was. Pete Seeger’s performance of the antiwar “Waist Deep in the Big Muddy” was cut out of his performance in an early Season 2 episode, but five months later he was allowed to sing the song. What today seems barely saucy would be cut. One early battle involved efforts to say “frigget” instead of “ribbet” in a frog sketch, David Bianculli recounts in “Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. ” A sort of guerrilla war broke out in which banned material would turn up in newspapers, including this one as early as April 1967, The New York Times reprinted a sketch by Elaine May that the network had killed. Yet some of the material that made it onto the air was pointed enough to raise eyebrows even today. A series of sketches in a December 1967 episode, for instance, mocked the American obsession with guns mercilessly. In one bit, a   contestant was to take shots at three hidden figures in hopes of killing either a stranger, a celebrity or his own wife. If the network was surprised by the show’s success and all the controversy, people on the creative side of things were, too. “I was naïve enough to think that nobody was watching except my friends,” said David Steinberg, who was then a   comedian who had made a few “Tonight Show” appearances. “We didn’t know that we were bothering the government. ” In Season 3, Mr. Steinberg did one of his satirical “sermonettes,” in which he tweaked religion, a subject that television of the day didn’t like to touch. Some time after that appearance, he said, he dropped by the show’s headquarters and Tom Smothers dragged him to a room that contained a bunch of bulging duffel bags. “I said, ‘What is this? ’” Mr. Steinberg recalled. “And he said, ‘It’s your hate mail. ’” In March 1969, Tom Smothers asked Mr. Steinberg to do another sermonette, although the network had banned the bit. That move is often credited with being the last straw, though it was just one of many, many straws. In any case, the network fired the Smotherses and canceled the show, though it was still pulling in decent ratings. Since those times, networks have learned that a certain amount of boundary pushing is healthy politicians have become more adept at manipulating TV and the people on the creative side have begun to understand that being on TV, especially in network prime time, requires compromises. That learning process continues today just ask Keith Olbermann or Bill Maher,   hosts whose mouths have landed them in hot water. Yet     content, the thing that got the Smothers Brothers in trouble, is all over prime time, even on comedies like “ . ” And now comes Donald J. Trump, who seems to have thin skin. The Smotherses incurred the wrath of two presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. Tom Smothers, who turns 80 in February, said in an interview in 2000 that he had always believed Nixon was directly responsible for his show’s demise. “There was a bigger game going on that was beyond our scope of understanding,” he said. Who knows what games lie ahead as a Twitter president takes office?",0
"Fiji spending soars to battle climate risks (Reuters) - Fiji warned on Friday it faces soaring costs to protect itself from climate change and called on the world to do more to curb carbon emissions to protect poor island nations from the increasing threat of floods and cyclones. In a report done with the World Bank, the South Pacific nation said it is spending almost 10 percent of its gross domestic product to guard against natural disasters, more than quadruple the level of five years ago. The report assessing the country s vulnerability to climate risks was released to coincide with Fiji chairing the COP23 global climate summit taking place in Bonn.  As the President of the COP23 and on behalf of the small island nations ... Fiji is asking the world for drastic action ... so that climate change does not impose a limit to our development,  Fijian Prime minister Voreque Bainimarama said in the report. Fiji is set to spend more than 350 million Fiji dollars ($168 million) this year on relocating villages, building improved bridges and roads and on responding to natural disasters, expected to become more frequent and severe due to climate change.  This is up from just over 50 million Fiji dollars, just over 2 percent of GDP, in 2013, the report said.   With increasing risks to the people and economy of Fiji due to climate change, finding the capacity to respond will only become more challenging,  it said. The risks include rising sea-levels, more floods and landslides, destruction of crops and farm equipment and increases in diseases such as Dengue fever, leptospirosis, and typhoid. The effects of climate change already cost the nation around 5 percent of its GDP every year, with the heaviest impact on the farm sector. Fiji is still reeling from Tropical Cyclone Winston in March 2016, the most powerful storm to make landfall in the southern hemisphere. The storm killed more than 40 people and caused 2 billion Fiji dollars in damage. ($1 = 2.0794 Fiji dollars) ",0
"NATO chief says Europe has interest in helping Afghanistan KABUL (Reuters) - NATO countries have strong reasons to maintain support for Afghanistan and will respond to U.S. President Trump s call for more troops and funding, the alliance s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday.  It is in the interest of Europe, of NATO allies to help stabilize Afghanistan,  Stoltenberg said during a visit to Kabul with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, which was overshadowed by a militant attack on Kabul airport. Trump made clear last month that he expected NATO to step up its contribution in Afghanistan when he announced a tougher new strategy against the Taliban and other militant forces. However the political reaction in Europe has been mixed with little public appetite for more involvement. In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is working to form a government after last weekend s election, her conservative party backs the mission. But senior figures from her two likely coalition partners, the liberal Free Democrats and environmental Greens, have expressed scepticism. In Italy, the anti-establishment 5-Star party, riding high in opinion polls ahead of elections early next year, has said it would pull Italy s force of more than 1,000 troops out.  Germany has been a strong supporter of the NATO mission in Afghanistan for many many years,  Stoltenberg said.  Germany is the lead nation in the north (of Afghanistan) and I m absolutely certain that Germany will continue to provide support.  Stoltenberg said NATO assistance was aimed at ensuring Afghanistan did not become  a safe haven for international terrorism.  But he reiterated that NATO troops would not be returning to the combat role they ended in 2014 and would continue training and advising Afghan forces as well as providing equipment and funding.  We are not going back to the big combat operations we had before. It will still be a non-combat operation.  Stoltenberg said Afghan forces, which have suffered thousands of casualties fighting the insurgency, had been  managing a very difficult situation . But they had prevented the Taliban from gaining control of any major provincial centers and would be boosted by plans to strengthen the Afghan Air Force and Special Forces units.  There will be setbacks but if we look at what we have achieved so far, we have been able to build a strong Afghan national security force and we ll build it even stronger.  ",0
"Trump to Keep Obama Executive Order Protecting LGBTQ Federal Workers - Breitbart An executive order signed by former President Barack Obama in 2014 protecting federal employees from   discrimination will continue to be enforced under the Trump administration, the White House announced Tuesday. [“President Donald J.

Trump. ”  The executive order signed by Obama in July 2014 prevents federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. “Donald Trump campaigned promising to be a ‘real friend’ to the LGBT community, and now President Trump is delivering on that commitment,” Log Cabin Republicans president Gregory Angelo told CNN. “Log Cabin Republicans is proud to have directly lobbied for this important preservation of LGBT equality in the federal workforce. ” Bloomberg News reported that President Trump might include an exemption for those affiliated with religious groups, but the White House has not made an official statement about exemptions to the executive order.",0
"Trump: New Steps Next Week to ’Keep Country Safe’ - Breitbart Friday at the White House, during a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, when asked about the 9th Circuit Court ruling upholding the blocking of his executive order banning immigrants from seven   countries from entering the United States, President Donald Trump said new steps would be forthcoming next week.  Trump said, “We are going to keep our country safe. We are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think we will be very successful with. It shouldn’t have taken this much time because safety is a primary reason, one of the reasons I’m standing here today, the security of our country, the voters felt that I would give it the best security. So we’ll be doing something very rapidly, having to do with additional security for our country. You’ll be seeing that sometime next week. In addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately I have no doubt that we’ll win that particular case. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
"Pressure mounts on Merkel over migrant policy in future coalition BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has lost track of 30,000 rejected asylum seekers, Bild daily reported on Thursday, piling pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree a migrant policy with potential coalition partners that ensures no repeat of a migration crisis in 2015. The paper said migrants were on a December 2016 list of people due to leave the country and quoted an interior ministry spokesman as saying they could not rule out that some  had already left or disappeared without the relevant authorities knowing . One commentator at Bild, which has run a campaign to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers, wrote:  No wonder many people are worried and unsettled. They ask:  Can the state protect me?  Politicians must take this insecurity seriously.  The report, coinciding with official data showing the number of people seeking refuge in Germany more than doubled in the two years until the end of 2016 to 1.6 million, comes amid warnings that courts are overburdened by the sheer volume of applications. Voters punished Merkel for her open-door policy in a September election, with her conservatives suffering heavy losses to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), and migration policy now tops the agenda in coalition talks. Her conservative bloc has tried to paper over internal divisions on migrant policy but is still at odds with the Free Democrats (FDP) and especially the Greens with whom they want to rule. Plans to discuss the issue on Thursday were delayed. Points of contention include to what extent family members should be allowed to join asylum seekers in Germany and putting limits on the number of people who arrive. The Statistics Office said the 1.6 million people seeking refuge by the end of last year was a 113 percent jump from 2014 and equivalent to 16 percent of Germany s foreign population. Included in the figures are people from abroad staying in Germany for humanitarian reasons, people still going through the asylum process, those granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status and failed asylum seekers who stay. More than half of the 1.6 million people had by the end of 2016 been granted permission to stay in Germany while some 158,000 were rejected asylum seekers, said the Office. Some 455,000 of the total were from Syria.  According to data requested by the Linke party and seen by Reuters, refugees made 321,837 aslyum applications in German courts in the year to June 30, five times the volume in the same period last year.  The administrative courts are so heavily burdened that the current staff can not deal with the work in a timely manner,  Erich Mueller-Fritzsche, a member of the Federation of German Administrative Judges, told Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper. Although the number of new arrivals to Germany has fallen sharply in the last 18 months and the government has stepped up deportations of rejected asylum seekers, many Germans, worried about security, say better controls are needed.  We need to know who is in our country and who has left,  said conservative Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, known for taking a tough line on migrants.  Last year, a failed asylum seeker from Tunisia killed 12 people when he drove a truck into a Berlin Christmas Market. On Tuesday, a 19-year old Syrian man was detained on suspicion of planning a bomb attack in Germany. The AfD, continuing to put pressure on politicians on the migrant issue, criticized the southern state of Baden Wuerttemberg for accepting 34,000 Syrian refugees.   Although the war in Syria is as good as over, the regional government does not mind the asylum authorities continuing to let Syrians stay here,  said the regional AfD in a statement. ",0
"Etihad flight from Abu Dhabi makes emergency landing in Australia SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Etihad Airways flight traveling from Abu Dhabi to Sydney made an emergency landing at Australia s Adelaide Airport early on Saturday after a warning indicator activated in the cockpit. Crew on board Etihad flight EY450 landed the plane at 5 a.m. (1830 GMT) at Adelaide Airport, in the state of South Australia. The Boeing 777 passenger jet had 349 passengers on board who disembarked via emergency exits, according to online news service Adelaide Advertiser. A technical fault with a cargo hold air recirculation fan had been found, Etihad Airways told Reuters in an email.  Etihad Airways apologizes for the inconvenience. The safety of our guests and crew is of paramount importance,  it said. Australia s ABC News had reported that a smoke alarm had activated.     Passengers would make their onward journeys via other airlines due to crew rest requirements, the airline said. Saturday s Etihad flight EY451, from Sydney to Abu Dhabi, had been canceled and passengers would be rescheduled on later Etihad services out of Sydney, the airline said. It was the second incident this year for the Etihad flight that connects Australia s biggest city with the hub of Abu Dhabi, where passengers transit for worldwide destinations. In July, four men were arrested in Sydney over an Islamist plot to attack the flight. One of the men sent his unsuspecting brother to catch the July 15 Sydney to Abu Dhabi flight carrying a bomb hidden in a meat-mincer. ",0
"White House chiefs of staff welcome new member to ranks WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eleven men who have held what is considered to be the toughest job in Washington - White House chief of staff - were to gather for lunch on Friday to welcome Reince Preibus, chief of staff to President-elect Donald Trump, to their ranks. President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, Denis McDonough, was hosting his successor at the gathering, along with former chiefs of staff from administrations dating back to the Jimmy Carter White House of 1977-1980. The White House lunch is similar to one hosted in 2008 by Josh Bolten, then chief of staff to outgoing President George W. Bush, for Obama’s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, a White House official said. Both Bolten and Emanuel will be at the lunch, joined by Obama’s three other former chiefs of staff - Jack Lew, Bill Daley and Pete Rouse - as well as Andrew Card, George W. Bush’s first chief of staff. Jack Watson, who was chief of staff to Jimmy Carter, was invited, along with Kenneth Duberstein from the Ronald Reagan White House and Samuel Skinner from the George H.W. Bush administration. Also invited: John Podesta, a chief of staff in the Bill Clinton White House who helped run Trump rival Hillary Clinton’s campaign for the presidency. ",0
"Lula and Simba, Last Surviving Animals at Mosul Zoo, Have Been Rescued - The New York Times AMMAN, Jordan  —   The last surviving animals in the Montazah   Zoo in the   Iraqi city of Mosul  —   Lula, a bear, and Simba, a lion  —   reached safety at a wildlife shelter in Amman, the Jordanian capital, on Monday night. Their home at the zoo was severely damaged as battles for control of the city, Iraq’s second largest, have raged for months between Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants. A   people are thought to be unable to escape the city. The Islamic State has used civilians as human shields, and American airstrikes, supporting Iraqi counterterrorism forces, have leveled parts of Mosul. A strike in one neighborhood last month was thought to have killed as many as 200 civilians. About 40 animals had died at the zoo in recent months. Some starved and some were killed by bombs, according to Four Paws International, an animal welfare organization based in Vienna that carried out the rescue. Workers said that the animals’ cages were filthy and that Simba and Lula urgently needed veterinary care. Amir Khalil, a veterinarian with Four Paws who led the rescue mission, called it an “authentic odyssey. ” The animals, he said, will now have proper food and medical care, “without living in constant danger of a nearby war zone and noise of bomb blasts in the background. ” Mr. Khalil visited the Mosul zoo in February to check on the animals and organize regular feedings for them. His group’s previous attempt to rescue the two animals failed when workers carrying them were stopped at a checkpoint. The aid workers were asked to leave Mosul. Lula and Simba were sent back to the zoo. “We never got to know the exact details why we were not allowed to pass, but, of course, transporting large wild animals in an area with such a complex political situation is not easy,” Mr. Khalil said Wednesday in a telephone interview. Mr. Khalil said Islamic State militants had been at the zoo and had painted over a sign with the animals’ faces. He said he had heard criticism about his attention to the animals at a time when so many people were suffering. “I like this kind of criticism,” he said, “because in my opinion humanity cannot be divided. ” He said Simba and Lula were a symbol of that humanity. “War rages on but all those fighting cannot ignore animals, put them in a cage, starve them to death, deprive them of water,” he said. Simba and Lula’s new home will be the New Hope Center, the biggest wildlife shelter in the Middle East.",0
"Sexism or compliment? German politician stokes debate BERLIN (Reuters) - A female German politician has triggered a fierce debate by accusing a former ambassador of sexism after he failed to recognize her at a conference and then said he was not expecting such a young and beautiful woman as a speaker. Sawsan Chebli, a 39-year-old state secretary in the Berlin city government, said she was sitting in the front row waiting to speak at a meeting of the Indo-German Society but was not recognized by the head of the group, Hans-Joachim Kiderlen. When he realized his mistake, the retired former German ambassador to India reportedly said:  I wasn t expecting such a young woman. And you are also so beautiful.  Chebli, a member of the centre-left Social Democrats, went ahead with her speech but posted on her Facebook page afterwards that she was in shock.  Of course, I m always experiencing sexism, but I have never experienced anything like what happened today,  she said. Her comments prompted an outpouring in German newspapers and social media, already abuzz as million of women across the world have been sharing their experiences of sexual harassment and abuse in an online campaign using the hashtag #MeToo. Chebli, a former spokeswoman for the German foreign ministry born to Palestinian refugee parents, was swamped with insults on her Facebook page, including suggestions that she wear a Muslim headscarf if she does not want to receive compliments. She also received messages of support, including from women who had similar experiences, including Teresa Buecker, editor-in-chief of the feminist magazine Edition F.  I have also been called up to the stage as the  beautiful speaker  - it is degrading and disrespectful,  Buecker wrote on Twitter. Kiderlen wrote to Chebli to apologize for his  inappropriate address and greeting , the Tagesspiegel daily reported on Thursday. ",0
"National Biotechnology Panel Faces New Conflict of Interest Questions - The New York Times The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine are assigned by Congress to provide policy guidance to the government. The group describes itself as “advisers to the nation. ” The advice often comes through written reports from scientific committees organized by the group. One of those committees, though, is facing questions about how its members were selected. The concerns focus on a panel studying biotechnology, a booming area of business, including in the food industry, and one of the most contentious scientific issues in Washington. Critics say that several committee members have financial ties to biotech businesses that could color the panel’s report, expected to be published soon, potentially giving short shrift to health and environmental worries. By the academies’ own account, two of the scientists already violate the group’s extensive    policy. In addition, an employee at the academies who helped pick the scientists to serve on the panel was pursuing a different job while he put together his recommendations for the group. Three of the 13 people he recommended  —   all of whom were eventually selected for the panel  —   were board members at his new employer, a new biotechnology nonprofit. The criticism adds to the heated debate about how federal regulators are handling the fast development of biotechnology. The National Academies play an outsize role in the debate because of their stature in the academic community and connections to the federal government. A separate study the organization did on genetic engineering in agriculture, published in May, also came under intense criticism from environmentalists. The National Academies have defended the panel that produced the May report, as well as the current panel on biotechnology, saying that the type of expertise needed to staff them is limited and thus some conflict must be tolerated. But people with ties to the academies say any perceived conflicts of interest may undermine some of the group’s authority. “There’s often a lot riding on what the academies say, and so their ability to act with objectivity and independence defines any value they have,” said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, a former leader of what is now the medical division of the National Academies. The most recent committee convened to study biotechnology was formed this year at the behest of the White House. The group was asked to predict what new technologies might arise over the next 15 years and advise the government on how to oversee them. The regulation for the industry was last updated in 1992, years before the first approval of genetically engineered seeds, which are now widely used by farmers. Like the 200 or so other reports published by the National Academies each year, the biotechnology report is undergoing peer review, the   process regularly used by academic journals. The report could have broad implications for the industry. Big food companies like   and Archer Daniels Midland, for instance, have invested in synthetic biology, a term used for the more sophisticated genetic engineering now coming into use that was the panel’s area of study. Food companies are exploring its use in creating flavorings and sweeteners. When the National Academies announced the committee this year, they disclosed that two of the group’s 13 scientists had ties to the biotech industry that violated the organization’s    policy. Such disclosures are rare for the academies, said William Kearney, a spokesman for the organization, but scientists with conflicts are sometimes allowed to work on a committee when the academies think the scientist has a specialty or knowledge that cannot be found elsewhere. Mr. Kearney would not, however, provide data on how frequently the academies have to disclose such conflicts, saying only that they are “rare. ” The two scientists with conflicts are Dr. Steven Evans, a scientist at Dow AgroSciences, a major biotechnology company, and Jeffrey Wolt, a professor at Iowa State University, who the academies said has investments in a company that could benefit from the study’s results. The academies noted their conflicts when the panel members were announced. Dr. Evans and Professor Wolt referred questions about their role to Mr. Kearney. Mr. Kearney said the disclosed conflicts of interest were discovered during the usual vetting of panel members by the academies. The academies kept the scientists on the panel, he said, because they could not find anyone with the same expertise. But more than three dozen environmental and health advocates argue that the National Academies also allowed several other scientists with potential financial conflicts onto the panel without any disclosures. “Several members of this committee stand to benefit directly or indirectly from the rules and regulations their recommendations will help shape,” said Tim Schwab, a food researcher at Food  Water Watch, an advocacy group leading the group of critics. “Nor does the committee include anyone who might advocate a more judicious approach to regulating the industry. ” The group made note of Farren Isaacs, an assistant professor at Yale. Professor Isaacs is a founder of enEvolv, a   that engineers tiny organisms “to produce   chemicals. ” DuPont, which has major investments in biotech, has funded Dr. Isaacs’s research, and he holds two patents that could be used in synthetic biology. Professor Isaacs referred questions to Mr. Kearney. Mr. Kearney said all conflicts that violate the academies’    policy had been disclosed when the panel was announced. Professor Isaacs, he said, did not have a conflict that required disclosure because his company’s technologies are not now being used in biotech. “The term ‘conflict of interest’ applies only to current interests, not prospective ones,” Mr. Kearney said. He said the same about similar questions raised about other members of the committee by the group of critics. (One panel member resigned: Richard Johnson, a former partner at Arnold  Porter, a law firm that counts many biotech companies as clients. Mr. Kearney attributed the decision to scheduling conflicts.) The job of finding the scientists to fill the 13 open spots on the biotech committee largely fell to Douglas Friedman, the “responsible staff officer,” or study director. Such employees help the academies identify scientists to serve on a study’s panel, set the agenda for their meetings and oversee the production of the final report, among other tasks. But while Mr. Friedman, who has degrees in chemistry and chemical biology, was putting together his recommendations, he was also applying for a leadership job in the biotech world. In January, Mr. Friedman widely distributed an email seeking nominations for the panel. The email was one of many digital records about Mr. Friedman and the panel that were discovered by Food  Water Watch. The group found the records, including the emails and spreadsheets, through Google searches of the panel’s members and shared them with The New York Times, which repeated the search and also found the documents. The records have since been removed from the websites where they had been cached. One recipient of the email was the Engineering Biology Research Consortium, a nonprofit dedicated to fostering and advancing synthetic biology research. According to the digital records discovered online, Mr. Friedman was firmly on the nonprofit’s radar as a possible leader by the time he began his search for members for the National Academies panel. Ginni Ursin, a Monsanto executive on the nonprofit’s board, commented on a spreadsheet dated December 2015 that Mr. Friedman was the “top candidate by a decent margin. ” The 13 scientists Mr. Friedman recommended to his superiors at the National Academies  —   including three members of the nonprofit’s board  —   were all ultimately approved, he said. The panel was appointed in April, and in July, Mr. Friedman started as the new executive director of the Engineering Biology Research Consortium. In a phone interview, he said that he pursued the new job while helping to put the panel together but did not see any reason to tell the academies about the job search. He said he was only one of many layers in the process of appointing members to the biotech panel. And he said it was a coincidence that so many committee members also have roles at the nonprofit. “It’s a relatively small community of people involved in the biotech space,” he said. But Mr. Kearney of the National Academies said Mr. Friedman should not have played the role he did in the selection of the committee in the midst of a job search he did not disclose. The National Academies, he said, are reviewing the selection process, including the oversight of the staff members who oversee it. “No staff member,” he said, “should be participating in the appointment of a committee with members who are also on the board of an organization with which he or she is negotiating employment. ”",0
"EU gives itself June deadline for deal on refugees BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders appealed for unity in a last-ditch effort to break their deadlock on sharing out refugees by June, telling reluctant eastern states they could otherwise be outvoted on a dispute that has shaken the bloc s foundations. Coming out from a fraught discussion among 28 EU leaders that went into the small hours on Friday morning in Brussels, rivals in the two-year-old dispute all stuck to their guns, hemmed in by expectations they have raised with their own voters. The Mediterranean frontline states Italy and Greece, and the rich destination countries including Germany, Sweden, Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are demanding that all countries host some refugees as a way to demonstrate solidarity. Their four ex-communist peers Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic refuse to accept people from the mostly-Muslim Middle East and North Africa, saying that would threaten their security after a raft of Islamic attacks in Europe.   There are areas where there is no solidarity and this is something I find unacceptable,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. At one point during the two days of talks in Brussels, cameras caught Merkel, the bloc s paramount national leader, as she appeared to become agitated when talking with the leaders  chairman, Donald Tusk, making her displeasure with him clear. That came after Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland,  came out strongly against  ineffective  and  highly divisive  obligatory refugee quotas, ruffling the feathers of those states that back them as well as the executive European Commission.  The manner in which the principle of solidarity was being questioned does not only undermine the discussion on the refugee issue, but the future of Europe,  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told reporters after what he called  intense  talks. Tusk said the ineffectiveness of relocation schemes was demonstrated by the fact that only 35,000 asylum seekers had been transferred from Greece and Italy under a 2015 plan meant to move 160,000 people.  Mandatory quotas remain a contentious issue,  Tusk told a joint news conference with the Commission s head Jean-Claude Juncker, the disagreement between the two playing out visibly despite their usually friendly rapport.  Relocation is not a solution to the issue of illegal migration.   Will a compromise be possible? It appears very hard. But we have to try our very best,  he said, stressing the bloc was in full agreement about making further efforts to tighten its borders and chip in for development and migration-related projects in the Middle East and Africa. After sealing a deal with Ankara in 2016 that cut off arrivals from Turkey to EU state Greece, the bloc is now pushing to stem African immigration to Italy through Libya.  Tusk, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and other leaders said they wanted to make permanent financing available for such activities in the bloc s next long-term budget from 2021. But it is the feud over how to share the burden of caring for those refugees who still make it to Europe that has weakened the bloc s cohesion and undermined member states  trust in each other at a time they need unity to face Brexit. After many months of letting the open wound fester, the backers of quotas made clear they want to move on and would vote on the broader reform of the bloc s asylum system by majority if no compromise acceptable for all is found by June on relocation.   I am not a fan of qualified majority decision-taking but... it can be used,  Juncker said.  Some of our colleagues were openly saying yesterday night that if there is no progress, they will propose qualified majority decision-making procedure.  That would inevitably deepen divisions in the EU and the four eastern states warned that the bloc would shoot itself in the foot should it go down this track.  The only proposal the EU has on the table on asylum reform has most recently been updated by Estonia and attempts to bridge the divide by proposing that any relocation of asylum-seekers from one EU state to another, while obligatory at times of extremely high arrivals, would in fact only take place if both involved agreed voluntarily to the terms. Diplomats in Brussels hoped Italy would be more willing to compromise after it holds elections, most likely in March, and said Germany could reassume the lead on the file after it forms a ruling coalition following an election last September. A senior EU diplomat from one of the pro-quota countries said they would seek to break the united front of the four eastern states to bring down the number of countries that would eventually be defeated in a vote if everything else fails.

"Turkey suspends all non-immigrant visa services at all diplomatic facilities in U.S. ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish embassy in Washington said on Sunday it suspended all non-immigrant visa services at all Turkish diplomatic facilities in the United States, after U.S. missions reduced visa services in Turkey. “Recent events have forced the Turkish government to reassess the commitment of government of the United States to the security of Turkish mission facilities and personnel,” the statement by the embassy in Washington said. The decision came hours after the U.S. mission to Turkey reduced visa services after one of its employees was detained last week, saying it needed to “reassess” Turkey’s commitment to the security of its personnel.

"Trump lawyers aim to delay fraud trial at hearing (Reuters) - Attorneys for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will try at a court hearing on Friday to delay a civil trial involving allegations from students that they were defrauded by the now-defunct Trump University.  The former students say they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn the New York businessman’s real estate investing “secrets” from his “hand-picked” instructors. Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students’ court papers said.  Trump denies the allegations and has argued he relied on others to manage the business. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego has urged both sides to settle in advance of a trial scheduled to begin on Nov. 28. Trump’s lawyers filed a motion last week asking to delay the case until after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, saying the presidential transition was “all-consuming.” They also proposed that Trump’s trial testimony be recorded before trial.  The students opposed the request, saying Trump had already provided several hours of deposition testimony that could be presented to a jury.  “Any delay would be a slippery slope because President-Elect Trump’s life is only going to get more complicated and unpredictable as time goes by,” they wrote. Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit is pending, filed by New York’s attorney general who has said over 5,000 students across the country were defrauded out of about $40 million. Trump aroused controversy earlier this year when he said during his campaign that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trump’s pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

"Elon Musk’s Boring Machine Brings Excitement to Los Angeles - Breitbart Inventor Elon Musk is into driverless cars and space missions to Mars, but now he’s excited about his boring machine. [Make that the Boring Machine, monikered Godot, a reference to a mysterious character that never appears in a Samuel Beckett play called “Waiting for Godot. ”  Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, announced last week that his new venture is ready for its first project.

After completion, cars may be loaded onto a   “electric sled,” which would allow a vehicle to be transported from “Westwood to LAX in 5 minutes,” according to Musk. To those unfamiliar with Los Angeles, the most congested city in the U. S. (according to Forbes) a typical drive between LAX and Westwood takes about 30 minutes. It’s not unusual to take an hour or more to traverse those 10 miles on the 405 Freeway during heavy traffic hours.

"Florida man admits helping funnel 2012 foreign political contribution (Reuters) - A Florida man pleaded guilty on Monday to working with another man to illegally funnel $80,000 in foreign contributions to U.S. President Barack Obama’s joint fundraising committee in 2012 so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event. William Argeros, 57, pleaded guilty in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, to charges that he knowingly and willfully made foreign contributions and donations and made a false  declaration to a federal grand jury, prosecutors said. U.S. law prohibits contributions from foreign nationals to candidates or fundraising committees in federal elections. A lawyer for Argeros did not respond to a request for comment. The Tampa, Florida, resident is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 9. The proceedings came a month after an earlier guilty plea in the case by Bilal Shehu, a New Jersey limousine driver to whom prosecutors said Argeros facilitated the transferring of $80,000 from a foreign source. Prosecutors said Shehu, a Paramus, New Jersey resident, then provided the money to Obama’s joint fundraising committee so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event on Oct. 8, 2012, in San Francisco. In announcing both guilty pleas, prosecutors have not specifically identified the foreign source of the money or the foreign national. But the cases came after a Republican congressman in 2013 called for investigations into the purchases by Shehu’s family of two $40,000 tickets for a San Francisco fundraiser, one of which was used by now-Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. At the October 2012 event, Rama, the Albanian Socialist Party leader, was photographed with Obama. U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California at the time contended the photo was then used for “deceitful” purposes by Rama to imply a relationship with Obama during Albania’s own election, which brought him into leadership. Prosecutors have said that the foreign national in the case was denied entry to the campaign event but was allowed to be photographed with Obama. Prosecutors said no one on the joint election committee has been accused of any wrongdoing and that it had cooperated fully in the investigation. ",0
"Clinton's pledge to curtail fracking falls on unconvinced ears WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton’s vow to regulate oil and gas fracking almost out of existence was met with skepticism Monday, failing to convince either industry or environment groups that she would - or could - end the controversial drilling practice if she becomes president. The front-runner for the Democratic party nomination used a debate in Flint, Michigan on Sunday night to oppose fracking anywhere local communities were against it, wherever it polluted air or water, and whenever companies refused to disclose what chemicals they use in the process.   “By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place,” she said. But supporters and opponents of fracking dismissed her position as campaign rhetoric that would collide with the limited powers of a president to control an activity largely regulated at the state level. Defenders of fracking said no president would try to put the brakes on a drilling technique that has flooded the U.S. with cheap oil and gas. “Secretary Clinton’s answer is essentially campaign hyperbole, and meant to appease her environmental constituency,” said Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Texas’ Southern Methodist University, in a blog post in the Dallas Morning News. “In reality, it has little substance to it.” Green groups welcomed Clinton’s shift from her past support for fracking. But they also urged her to stop laying down conditions and caveats. “Clinton will continue to struggle to convince climate advocates that she is serious about addressing the crisis until she comes out for a full ban on fracking,” said Yong Jung Cho, campaign coordinator of grassroots groups 350 Action. As secretary of state, Clinton supported fracking as a way to reduce U.S. dependence on imported energy, and even led a push to spread shale extraction to allies in Europe to wean them off Russian gas.[L1N0VX2JT] Her pledge in Flint to curtail the practice followed the blunt declaration against fracking by Senator Bernard Sanders, her sole rival for the nomination. Sanders’ challenge has shifted some of Clinton’s positions in the campaign, and her statement on fracking now comes closer to wider Democratic party sentiment. “Secretary Clinton has been pushed to the left by Senator Sanders,” said Kathleen Sgamma, vice president of government affairs at the Western Energy Alliance. Sgamma said Democrats from President Barack Obama to Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper support fracking and the economic benefits its brings to many states.  “Sometimes things said in the heat of a debate are later wisely set aside when faced with the economic and national security consequences of shutting down the technique that unlocks huge domestic sources of energy that would otherwise have to come from Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran,” she said. The Clinton campaign said the candidate has previously criticized fracking when it clashed with local opposition. “If a local government says no (to fracking), not here, they should be able to do that,” Clinton said during a campaign stop in Keene, New Hampshire last October. But fracking for natural gas has also drastically reduced the amount of coal being burned to produce electricity, and has been mostly supported by the Obama administration.  David Koranyi, director of the Eurasian Energy Future Initiative at the Atlantic Council said Clinton’s “very circumspect” answer to the question in Flint actually reflected the Obama administration’s current approach to fracking, which  seeks to continue expanding shale production with more environmental oversight. “I believe wrapped in her strong statement is a pragmatic approach that recognizes the merits of natural gas as a bridge fuel in the process of decarbonization,” he said.  Clinton’s harder line did, however, delineate the clear differences between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. All Republican contenders have strongly defended fracking, leading Louis Finkel of the American Petroleum Institute to attack Clinton’s position as “a political stunt by those who are spouting populist rhetoric for political points.” The importance of fracking to the American economy, he said, means the Democrats “are not being honest with American voters.”  (Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Bernard Orr) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"Senators seek to block $1.15 billion U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four U.S. senators introduced a joint resolution on Thursday seeking to block the U.S. sale of $1.15 billion of Abrams tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia, citing issues including the conflict in Yemen. The measure was introduced by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Democrats Chris Murphy and Al Franken, the latest indication of strong disapproval of the deal among some U.S. lawmakers. “Selling $1.15 billion in tanks, guns, ammunition, and more to a country with a poor human rights record embroiled in a bitter war is a recipe for disaster and an escalation of an ongoing arms race in the region,” Paul said in a statement. In August, 64 members of the House of Representatives signed a letter urging President Barack Obama to delay the sale. The Pentagon announced on Aug. 9 that the State Department has approved the potential sale of more than 130 Abrams battle tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment to Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which implements foreign arms sales, said that General Dynamics would be the principal contractor for the sale. Introducing the resolution, the senators cited the conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition in support of forces loyal to the exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi who are trying to oust Iran-allied Houthi forces from the capital, Sanaa. Human rights groups have criticized the coalition’s air strikes because of the deaths of civilians. “Thousands of civilians are being killed, and terrorist groups inside the country, like al Qaeda and ISIS, are getting stronger. Until the Saudis’ conduct changes, the U.S. should put a pause on further arms sales,” Murphy said in a statement. Some congressional aides questioned whether Congress had the right to try to block the sale, since it has been more than 30 days since Congress was notified about it. But the four senators said the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 allows senators to force a vote on an arms sale by a president. Human rights activists applauded the resolution. “Congress’ silence would signal to the Yemeni people that U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen is unconditional – no matter how cruel the parties’ methods of warfare or how unwilling they are to make peace,” Scott Paul, senior humanitarian policy advisor at Oxfam America, said in a statement.

"EXCLUSIVE - Islamic State Supporters Vow Terror Group Will Retake Mosul as ‘Liberators’ Writing in an encrypted chat room, Islamic State sympathizers and militants celebrated the   anniversary of the terrorist organization’s capture of Mosul, Iraq’s   city. [Despite losing most of Mosul to the U. S.  international coalition, the IS supporters vowed that they would return and take control over the entire city once more.  IS completed its takeover of Mosul from Iraqi forces on June 10, 2014. Over the last eight months, the group has been fighting a difficult battle against Iraqi forces supported by an international coalition led by the United States and has lost control of most of the city except for a few pockets of resistance. Nonetheless, the IS members in the chat room marked the   anniversary, with Abi Aisha Almosulawi writing, “Thank Allah who blessed us with the blessing of Islam. Thank Allah who granted us the Islamic State that rules through Allah’s sharia. The campaign of conquests began here in Mosul and now we’re dealing with a brutal crusader Shi’ite war, but we have not surrendered and will not surrender. We will continue to harm the infidels and continue to disturb their peace even if we lose Mosul three years after liberating it. This isn’t over. We will continue to trust in Allah and the victory he is expected to grant us one day. ” Abi Huzaifa Almosolawi wrote, “Today marks three years since the capture of Mosul and its liberation from the hands of the blasphemous Shi’ites. This glorious conquest that Allah gave his warriors and gave them the opportunity to implement sharia was the beginning of the fulfillment of Allah’s promise to the loyal mujahedeen.    “We may lose the land but we will never lose the desire to enforce holy sharia on every meter in our control. We will return to Mosul again as liberators and we will liberate Baghdad, Syria, Egypt, Palestine and all the land to impose holy sharia. Even Rome will be liberated and when we enter it we will yell Allah is great, with the help of Allah. ” Abi Talha Almagrebi (the Moroccan) wrote, “From the pulpit of the mosque in Mosul, the Caliph Abu Bakr (Al Baghdadi) came out and declared the Caliphate. From here, the land of Mosul. From Mosul, we went forth to liberate Fallujah, Al Anbar and other places. Today we come back to the desert but we do so while clinging to the divine promise. We cling to holy sharia and we won’t compromise with the infidels. The right and justice lies with us. We will come back here as liberators. When we return as liberators, with the help of Allah, we will remember our mujahedeen brothers Abi Ali Alanbari (a senior military commander in IS who was killed) and the Sheikh Abo Mohamad Aladnani (an IS spokesperson who was killed). ” The U.  offensive in Mosul began about eight months ago, with the terrorist group losing most of the city to Iraqi forces except for an area at the western section of the Tigris river. On Saturday, U. S.  Iraqi forces repelled an IS offensive in the Sunni town of Shirqat, just south of Mosul.",0
"Oklahoma lawmaker, found with boy in motel, charged with prostitution (Reuters) - An Oklahoma Republican state senator who campaigned as a champion of family values was booked on felony prostitution charges on Thursday after police found him in a motel room with a teenage boy and drugs, court documents showed. Ralph Shortey, 35, was charged with three felony counts, including engaging in child prostitution, court documents filed in Cleveland County showed. Shortey, who has served since 2010, has not spoken to media about the incident. According to an arrest affidavit, police found Shortey and a 17-year-old male, who was not named, in a motel room in Moore, south of Oklahoma City, on March 9.  “Officers present observed a strong odor of marijuana coming from the room and inside the room at the time of their contact with the defendant,” the affidavit said, adding the officers also “found an opened box of condoms in the defendant’s backpack.” According to court records, Shortey was booked at a local jail on Thursday afternoon. His bond has been set at $100,000 and local media said he was released about two after he surrendered. Oklahoma politicians from both major parties called on Shortey to resign, including Republican Governor Mary Fallin. “The charges against him do not reflect the character and decorum that we expect of an elected official,” Fallin said in a statement. A guns rights advocate who has taken a hard-line stance against abortion, Shortey was sanctioned by the Republican-dominated state Senate on Wednesday on a 43-0 vote for “disorderly behavior.”  The sanctions imposed penalties such as stripping him of his office space, removing him from committee positions and canceling his reserved parking space.

"Chuck Plays Chicken: Would Block New FBI Director Until Special Prosecutor Named - Breitbart Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer ( ) told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday that he supports a proposal by Sen. Mark Warner ( ) to block the confirmation of the next FBI director until a special prosecutor is named to investigate allegations of collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Russian government. [“We’ll have to discuss it as a caucus, but I would support that move,” Schumer told host Jake Tapper.  However, under the filibuster rule changes initiated by former Majority Leader Harry Reid ( ) in 2013, the Senate minority cannot actually block the confirmation of any executive branch appointees. Schumer himself seemed to acknowledge the point implicitly: “The key here, of course, is getting some of our Republican colleagues to join us,” he told Tapper. There is almost no Republican support for a special prosecutor  —   largely because there are no crimes yet to prosecute. President Donald Trump is not even under investigation. The FBI’s inquiry has reportedly centered around three Trump campaign aides who played minor roles, and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Even perennial gadfly Sen. John McCain has only called for a select committee, not a special prosecutor. Also, as Breitbart News’ Ken Klukowski has pointed out, Trump was within his legal authority to fire former FBI Director James Comey  —   something Democrats had demanded for months. Moreover, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was confirmed last month by the Senate in a   vote, is overseeing the Russia investigation, with which Trump has not interfered  —   even if he has objected to the way it is being used by Democrats to justify their 2016 losses and rally political enthusiasm among their frustrated   base. The Trump administration reportedly interviewed eight possible candidates to replace Comey this weekend, and more continue to be proposed. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

"Lawyers Mobilize at Nation’s Airports After Trump’s Order - The New York Times Even before President Trump issued an order on Friday banning immediate entry into the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim countries, immigration lawyers, having heard rumors of coming action from the White House, were on alert. On Wednesday, lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center who were concerned that the action would affect the project’s clients sent out an email calling for lawyers who could volunteer immediately to go to airports where refugees were scheduled to enter the United States. “It occurred to us that there were going to be people who were traveling who would land and have their status affected while in midair,” said Betsy Fisher, the group’s policy director. And that is exactly what happened. Across the country, people were detained on Sunday after being caught up in the aftermath of Mr. Trump’s order, even though a petition filed on Saturday in federal court in Brooklyn led a judge to block part of the order. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, the plaintiffs named in the petition, were originally clients of Ms. Fisher’s organization. The email received a tremendous response, Ms. Fisher said, with “well over a thousand people” expressing interest and availability. By Saturday morning, the lawyers who heeded the call were at about a dozen airports around the country. Others who heard about the effort through colleagues or the news media went to airports on their own to pitch in. By early Sunday morning, Ms. Fisher said, lawyers offering services and advice were at “most international airports in the United States. ” Andre Segura, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:30 p. m. on Saturday. He said that the outside section of Central Diner, a restaurant in Terminal 4, was “entirely taken over by attorneys,” all working to file petitions for individual clients with the help of the clients’ families. “There were attorneys from numerous major law firms, nonprofits, all working together,” Mr. Segura said. “I’ve never seen that immediate coming together of teams to start filing actions to try to protect people. ” He added, “The dynamic between what was happening inside the terminal with all the attorneys, and outside with massive protests and people holding signs  —   I’ve never experienced anything like that. ” Mr. Segura said he arrived home around 2 a. m. on Sunday. He woke up at 5:30 and began answering emails from lawyers who had stayed overnight at the airport. While lawyers gathered at airports on Saturday, others were working furiously on litigation. Cecillia Wang, the A. C. L. U.’s deputy legal director, described the scene at her office as “complete chaos. ” “I was sitting at my desk working on a template habeas petition that could be used by lawyers at airports all around the country,” she said. Omar Jadwat, the director of the A. C. L. U.’s Immigrant Rights Project, which worked on the petition that led to the judge’s stay, said the litigation had not been prepared ahead of time. “That was not something we had on the shelf ready to go, waiting for the right plaintiffs to come along,” he said. “It was a case of: There’s this emergency, and people have to work together to figure out a response as quickly as we can so that these people and other people around the country didn’t get deported. ” Even after word of the federal court’s order reached the airport in New York, confusion reigned. Alina Das, a professor of clinical law at New York University School of Law, said she had arrived at the airport at 7 p. m. on Saturday and stayed overnight, working to get a client released. Ms. Das, who said she could not comment on her client’s situation, described the scene on Sunday morning, saying that it was “incredibly difficult to get an answer on whether our clients were going to be sent back or whether they were being processed for release” and that people remained detained even after the court order blocked part of the president’s actions. Avi Gesser, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell, described the process in Terminal 4 on Saturday, saying that a group of people had been deployed to search for those whose family members were detained. “If they found people, they referred them over to us and we onboarded people as clients if we could, and then filed habeas petitions,” he said. Mr. Gesser, who is originally from Canada, did not leave the airport until 4:30 a. m. on Sunday, he said. “Our firm has a lot of people who were not born in the United States,” he said. “We felt that people who were being detained needed legal representation. And that’s something that we do very well. ” Rebecca Heller, who was coordinating lawyers’ efforts on the ground for the International Refugee Assistance Project on Saturday, said that by Sunday afternoon, her services were far less in demand. “They’re   now!” she said excitedly in a brief phone call. “That’s how a movement starts. ”",0

"Congo Republic signs peace accord with 'Ninja' rebels BRAZZAVILLE (Reuters) - The government of Congo Republic on Saturday agreed a ceasefire with rebels in the southeast region of Pool, halting a 15-year conflict that rights groups say has cost dozens of lives and forced tens of thousands to flee. Political violence spiked in the Central African oil producer after a contested presidential election in April 2016 was won by President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who has ruled for 33 of the last 38 years. A militia led by Frederic Bintsamou, better known as Pastor Ntumi, which fought Sassou Nguesso during and after a 1997 civil war, has been blamed by the government for deadly raids on police, military and government bases, and has also halted trade through the Pool region with blockades. In return, the government has bombed the Pool region, including one helicopter raid last year on a residential area that Amnesty International said killed at least 30 people. The unrest has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes and sparked allegations from human rights groups of abuse by government troops. Ntumi s so-called Ninja rebels have clashed with the Congo government since 2002 and have long sought an end to government military intervention in the Pool region. The peace agreement between the two sides was signed by Interior Ministry security advisor Fran ois Nd  and Pastor Ntumi s representative, Jean Gustave Ntondo.   Today is a great day for the Congolese. This is the day we have just signed the cessation of hostilities agreement,  said Ntondo.  Under the deal, the militias have agreed to hand over arms and allow the free movement of trade between the capital Brazzaville and the commercial hub of Pointe Noire. During hostilities, trains and cars were often halted by militias.  The government will oversee a commission that will monitor the peace, and loosen security in the region to allow people to travel to and from their family homes.  ",0
"Food and drug chief Gottlieb skirts health secretary talk, says most effective at FDA (Reuters) - U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, considered a potential successor to recently departed Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, said on Tuesday he believed he could best serve the Trump administration in his current role.     “I feel like I want to continue to follow through on the policies we’ve put out and it’s where I think I can be most effective,” Gottlieb told Reuters in an interview in New York. He declined to say whether he had been approached about the job by the White House. “I’m not going to get into private discussions I might have had around that,” he said. Gottlieb is one of several potential candidates for the top job at HHS, a post vacated by Price last month following an uproar over his use of private jets for government business. Other names mentioned by health policy experts include Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. Gottlieb has won mostly positive reviews since taking over as FDA commissioner in May. He has introduced policies tackling some of the country’s biggest health challenges, including opioid and tobacco addiction and rising prescription drug prices.  The top post at the FDA has always been difficult to fill, Gottlieb noted, and there have been long stretches where the agency has operated under an acting commissioner. Gottlieb once served as senior adviser to FDA commissioner Mark McClellan, who left the agency in 2004 after just two years to run CMS, a move that Gottlieb said was detrimental to the agency. “It’s always challenging to move an FDA commissioner,” he said. “Continuity of leadership there is important.” In a wide-ranging interview, Gottlieb said the situation on the ground in Puerto Rico, where 10 percent of drugs prescribed in the United States are made, was “very bad” and that shortages of some drugs could emerge within as little as two to three weeks. He also said the agency is going to more clearly define regulations around cell therapies. The law currently states that if a cell is extracted from a patient’s body and more than minimally manipulated it is a drug subject to FDA regulation. “Historically the FDA hasn’t vigorously enforced around that line because it didn’t have the implementing guidelines to do that,” he said. At the same time, the agency plans novel measures to make it easier for small academic centers to apply for FDA product approval by pooling data generated from similar work. “If academicians working at different academic sites are doing a similar procedure with stem cells, if they are all following the same protocol, then they’re going to be able to pool their data to submit it for regulatory approval,” he said.

"Robert Redford for WaPo: ’45 Years After Watergate, The Truth is Again in Danger’ - Breitbart In a guest column for the Washington Post, actor Robert Redford describes the difficulty he had in getting Hollywood producers interested in his 1976 film All the President’s Men, which revolves around the investigation into former President Richard Nixon’s Watergate scandal, and warns that 45 years after that politically momentous event, “the truth is again in danger. ”[Redford writes at the Washington Post:    …     This year marks the 45th anniversary of the Watergate scandal. Because of my role in the film, some have asked me about the similarities between our situations in 1972 and 2017. There are many. The biggest one is the importance of a free and independent media in defending our democracy. When President Trump speaks of being in a “running war” with the media, calls them “among the most dishonest human beings on Earth” and tweets that they’re the “enemy of the American people,” his language takes the Nixon administration’s false accusations of “shoddy” and “shabby” journalism to new and dangerous heights. Sound and accurate journalism defends our democracy. It’s one of the most effective weapons we have to restrain the  . I always said that “All the President’s Men” was a violent movie. No shots were fired, but words were used as weapons.   …     Read Redford’s full column at the Washington Post.",0
"WNBA Players in Turkey Worry About Rise in Terror - The New York Times Kiah Stokes celebrated New Year’s Eve at a nightclub in Istanbul, where she plays basketball for Besiktas of the Turkish league. But a night of revelry turned alarming when club employees told patrons they had to shut down early for security reasons. As Stokes and her friends left the building, they saw   roads. They cautiously walked for about 10 minutes before finding a taxi to take them home, not knowing that a gunman had killed 39 people at another club down the street and was still at large. “You don’t think something can happen,” said Stokes, who, in September, finished her second season with the Liberty of the W. N. B. A. “Now I’m like, ‘Wow, this is just scary. ’” Players like Stokes have long packed up after the W. N. B. A. season and spent their winters abroad, competing with teams that offer larger paychecks than the women can earn in the American league. This   more W. N. B. A. players ended up in Turkey than in any other country. There are now 26, according to the league’s players’ association. The unrest there  —   an attempted coup last summer and multiple terrorist attacks  —   has led some players to question the costs of taking a second job overseas. It has also added urgency to efforts to keep W. N. B. A. players in the United States in the  . “It’s kind of sad we can’t stay home,” said Liberty guard Sugar Rodgers, who played for the Turkish club Osmaniye but returned to Virginia in November because she did not feel safe. About two weeks after the Liberty were eliminated from the playoffs, Rodgers joined Osmaniye, which is based about two hours from the Syrian border. Shortly after her arrival, a car bombing killed at least 17 people at a checkpoint in Syria’s Aleppo Province. “That right there shook me,” said Rodgers, who has also played in France, Israel and Slovakia. She acknowledged that the United States was not immune to such violence, but in Turkey, the threat of danger felt almost constant. “Getting emails saying families from embassies are leaving  —   the consulate or embassy were leaving  —   that rings a bell,” Rodgers said. She soon got out of her contract. “My team was understanding,” Rodgers said, adding, “I’m not going to play to my full potential always watching over my back. ” As Turkey became increasingly unstable last year, the W. N. B. A. and the players’ association arranged new security measures for the women who would go overseas in the  . In late December, the league provided an app that would allow players to communicate easily with the W. N. B. A. office from anywhere in the world. In an emergency, the office can give information about safe areas and contacts. Jayne    —   the union’s associate director of player relations, who competed in China and Turkey as well as in the W. N. B. A.  —   set up and maintained a group chat for the league’s players in Turkey. When Terri Carmichael Jackson, a former N. C. A. A. executive, became the director of operations for the players’ association last May, she focused on improving security for players overseas. The union met with the league’s director of security, Eric Rhodes, who suggested more collaboration with the State Department and some relatively simple measures, like pointing players to the department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. The program, a State Department spokesman said, allows travelers to “receive messages from the nearest U. S. Embassy or Consulate, which stand at the ready to assist U. S. citizens abroad. ” “We get news of an incident,” Jackson said, “and we kind of have a   plan in place, informally, here in the office. ” She added, “There’s always a concern there might be a blackout with media and news services. ” Lisa M. Borders, the W. N. B. A.’s president, was attending church services when she heard about the Istanbul attack. Last season, her first as president, Borders gave her personal cellphone number to every player in the league. Until New Year’s Eve, it was seen primarily as a gesture of good will. Borders said that after contacting the league’s security officials that night for instructions, she reached out to players individually. She declined to name which players had communicated with her. “I feel compelled to be deeply engaged with my players overseas, as well as domestically,” she said. “Speaking to players immediately in harm’s way is very relieving to me  —   that I can reach them with a phone call, that they will answer me or FaceTime me and let me know what’s happening. ” Players have noticed the league’s increased efforts to ensure their safety abroad. But many pointed out that they would not feel the need to leave the United States if their W. N. B. A. salaries were higher. According to the most recent   agreement,   players in the W. N. B. A. received a base salary of $39, 676 to $50, 617 in 2016, not including performance bonuses, housing stipends and other benefits. A player in her third year made as much as $54, 609. The most recent   agreement also included a $50, 000   bonus for each team to distribute among players who limit their overseas competition to three months or less. Aside from relieving security fears, an athlete who stays in the United States avoids the physical stress of an extra basketball season. The league also offers professional internships and   programs for the   and it is considering other ways to keep players home in the winter. “I get it,” Borders said. “You want to make sure you are having one job making enough money to pay bills, sustain family and do things we all want to do. That day will come. ” The league needs more revenue for that to happen, she said, adding that her chief operating officer, Jay Parry, met early this month with executives from each team to explore ways to increase attendance. Stokes, who did not disclose her Besiktas salary, said she would probably forgo her second job if the W. N. B. A. could replace most of her overseas income. An ESPN article in 2012 quoted an agent’s estimate that the average overseas salary for a female basketball player was $72, 000. For now, Stokes plans to remain in Turkey until the season ends in early May, despite the hazards. A few weeks before the New Year’s Eve attack, dozens of people were killed in a double bombing outside Besiktas’s soccer stadium, about a mile from where Stokes lives. “It freaked me out,” she said. She had read about the country’s turmoil during the summer, but she took comfort in knowing that a Liberty teammate who had played in Turkey before, Shavonte Zellous, would also be on the Besiktas team. But Zellous said her past experience in the country did not match what she was seeing this season. “The cities they’re bombing, I never imagined terror groups doing something in these cities,” Zellous said. “I think stuff is really getting real now. ” Stokes said that security measures had become noticeably stronger at games and that the team had more frequent police escorts on the road. She also said that she had become attached to her Turkish team and felt a certain level of commitment to it, even if friends and family yearn for her to return. “My mom wants me to come home right now,” Stokes said. “She said it’s too dangerous, it’s scary. She knows the money is good, but it’s not worth it. It definitely crossed my mind. ”",0
"South Sudan army, rebels clash hours after ceasefire NAIROBI (Reuters) - South Sudan s army clashed with rebels in an oil-producing region early on Sunday, both sides said, shattering a ceasefire hours after it came into effect.  Both sides accused the other of starting the fighting around the town of Koch in Unity state. Seventeen aid workers fled the violence, according to a humanitarian source. There were no immediate details of casualties. The government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on Thursday in the latest attempt to end a four-year civil war and let humanitarian groups reach civilians. The ceasefire formally came into force on Sunday morning, but fighting broke out soon afterwards, according to a humanitarian security report seen by Reuters.   Our forces came under heavy fire this morning in Koch county,  Dickson Gatluak, a spokesman for the government side, said.  Our forces acted in self defense and repulsed the attacking forces and defeated them,  he added in a statement. Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said the army attacked first and rebel forces were now pursuing government soldiers towards the town.  The world s youngest country plunged into war in late 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy, Riek Machar.  The dispute erupted into fighting that spread across the country, largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to Kiir, who is Dinka, and Machar, who is Nuer.  The violence, which the United Nations says has amounted to ethnic cleansing, has forced a third of the population to flee.  Earlier this year, pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine. ",0
"The U.S. government’s predatory-lending program Most parents will do just about anything for their children, especially when it comes to education. Predictably, at a time when college costs are exploding and students are staggering under more than $1 trillion in debt, one opportunistic lender is making huge profits on loans to their doting moms and dads.

Less predictably, that lender is the United States government.

The fast-growing federal program known as Parent PLUS now serves 3.2 million borrowers, who have racked up $65 billion in debt helping their kids go to school. The loans have much in common with the regular student loans that have created a national debt crisis and a 2016 campaign issue, but PLUS has much higher interest rates and fees, and far fewer opportunities for loan forgiveness or reductions.

In fact, the PLUS program, which includes similar loans to graduate students, is the most profitable of the 120 or so federal lending programs. That sounds like a good thing, until you remember the government’s profit comes from its own citizens, often citizens of modest means.

Parent PLUS was created in 1980 to provide small loans to help reasonably well-off families finance the American Dream of an undergraduate education. But in an era of skyrocketing education costs, it has grown to look a lot like publicly funded predatory lending, providing almost any borrowers with almost unlimited cash to attend any school with almost no regard to their ability to repay. Thirteen percent of undergraduates now rely on Parent PLUS, and many of their parents are falling into debt traps.

“You feel so guilty that you haven’t done enough for your kid, and they make it so easy to get the loans,” said Elizabeth Hill, a 57-year-old property appraiser from the Boston suburbs with more than $30,000 in PLUS debt. “Then they’ve got you by the cojones. It’s like ‘The Sopranos,’ except it’s the government.”

For all the controversy swirling around student loans, lending money directly to students at least has a “human capital” rationale, since recipients pursue degrees that can boost their earning power and help them fulfill their obligations. But when parents borrow, they’re often taking on new debts just as their earning power is starting to dwindle. They’re not building human capital. They’re just getting closer to retirement, mortgaging their futures on behalf of their children. And if they default, the government can garnish their wages and even their Social Security checks — less brutal than “The Sopranos,” but just as effective.

According to the White House budget office, the expected recovery rate for defaulted Parent PLUS loans is a remarkable 106 percent, a testament to Uncle Sam’s unique power as a collection agency. Overall, the program is expected to return $1.23 on every dollar it lends this year, thanks to its relatively high interest rates and minimal opportunities for debt relief, as well as the government’s relentlessness in tracking down overdue education loans. The only federal loans that generate slightly better returns are the similar PLUS loans to graduate students, which have much lower default rates.

POLITICO has been investigating the government’s bizarre $3.3 trillion loan portfolio, which is riddled with tensions between the interests of borrowers and taxpayers. Some credit programs are almost comically risky for the government, most memorably a rural broadband effort with an official default rate of a seemingly impossible 116 percent. Parent PLUS loans are the flip side of the coin, generating reliable profits for taxpayers but serious risks for moderate-income borrowers.

Just about everyone I interviewed thought Congress should consider major reforms to Parent PLUS when it takes up a higher education bill this fall, but no one was too optimistic that reforms would pass, largely because of those profits.

“Parent PLUS is classic predatory lending. It’s not a safe product for many of these families, and the debts will hound them forever,” said Rachel Fishman, an education policy analyst at the nonpartisan New America think tank. “But it’s a cash cow for the government, so it’s going to be extremely difficult to reform.”

Parent PLUS is not a trap for everyone. The latest data suggest that only 5 percent of borrowers are defaulting within their first three years of repayment, although that figure is rising rapidly. The White House budget tables suggest the expected default rate over the course of the loans is well above 10 percent, which is still well below the rate for regular student loans. There’s a wealth of evidence that college degrees boost lifetime earnings, and defenders of Parent PLUS say it’s an important tool for increasing college graduation rates. PLUS loans have also become a key revenue source for many schools, particularly historically black colleges and for-profits that tend to serve lower-income families.

But that just illustrates the increasingly tortured economic paradoxes at the heart of modern higher education, where schools have no incentive to provide affordable prices as long as they can count on federal dollars for making education affordable. Ultimately, Parent PLUS sluices more cash into the college-industrial complex, helping educators jack up their tuitions while pressuring parents to make up the difference with debt, while doing nothing to ensure they’re getting a real return on their investment. It enhances accessibility, but not really affordability, simply giving parents a way to punt the skyrocketing costs into the future. Even some advocates who fiercely defended Parent PLUS during a high-profile controversy in 2011, when the Obama administration briefly reined in loans to parents with sketchy credit histories, told me the program is deeply troubled and inherently flawed.

When I spoke to White House education adviser Roberto Rodriguez about this conundrum, he emphasized that President Barack Obama has crusaded to make America the world’s leader in access to higher education, expanding Pell grants to low-income students and “income-based repayment” for burdensome student loans, while proposing to make community college free. Parent PLUS, he said, is another important tool to help young people pursue a better life. But he also said he's concerned that too many struggling parents are getting in too deep. When I asked him if the Education Department was running a predatory lending program, he didn’t say no.

“That’s the heart of the matter,” Rodriguez said. “You want to expand access and choice, but you also want to make sure families can afford these loans.”

HILL AND HER husband are solidly middle class and proudly thrifty; she drives a 15-year-old minivan and shops at TJ Maxx. She and her husband put away money for their son Aaron’s education, and though they burned through some savings when Hill lost her job early in the Great Recession, they figured they’d be fine when Aaron chose the University of Massachusetts at Amherst over several private colleges. He also won some academic grants and maxed out on federal student loans. But even a public school like UMass cost $25,000 a year. Hill just couldn’t make the numbers work.

Until, suddenly, she could. Hill discovered she was eligible for Parent PLUS, which would cover whatever Aaron’s grants and loans didn’t. At the time, Hill felt like she had won something, even though the loans are entitlements for anyone without a recent history of “adverse credit.” She feels differently now that Aaron has moved back home with his degree and taken a job at a local liquor store — and her husband may have to postpone his plans for retirement to make ends meet.

“You’re at your wits’ end, you want to help your kid, and this fairy princess appears on your computer and says: ‘Want some money?’” Hill recalled. “You’re like: Bingo! It’s more than you can afford, but dammit, education is important, right? Then four years later, you can’t believe how much you owe.”

When Congress created Parent PLUS 35 years ago, the loans were capped at $3,000 per year, until that was lifted in 1992 so families could borrow as much as they wanted toward the cost of attendance at any public or private school. But the rules do not allow colleges to ask about their income or their ability to pay. And the borrowers don’t have to start making payments until the student leaves school, although the interest accumulates the whole time.

Congress set the maximum interest rate at 9 percent in 1980, which seemed generous at a time when mortgage rates were skyrocketing toward 18 percent, but Parent PLUS is no longer a particularly attractive deal for families with other options. The current rates are about 7 percent plus a 4 percent origination fee, a lot lower than credit card debt or payday loans, but a lot higher than subsidized student loans.

“I figured the rate wasn’t terrible, and the money was so easy to get,” said Debbie Hounanian, a 56-year-old office manager in the Los Angeles suburbs who racked up $54,000 in Parent PLUS debt. “I had no idea what I was getting into.”

Today, the average Parent PLUS loan is about $13,000, and many parents pile up much larger debts now that some schools cost more than $50,000 a year. The loans are almost impossible to discharge in bankruptcy, just like student loans, but they’re ineligible for most of the income-based payment relief available for student loans. Consumer advocates compare them to subprime mortgages before the bust, encouraging families to bite off more debt than they can chew — except that Parent PLUS also has a government imprimatur.

Toby Merrill, who runs a Harvard-affiliated legal services clinic that focuses on predatory lending, recalls one ready-to-retire borrower who contacted her after running up $150,000 in PLUS debt on three children.

“The question was: What are my options?” Merrill said. “It was sad, because the answer was: You don’t really have options.”

AS STATE AID for higher education has plunged while the cost of college has escalated, PLUS loans have become an increasingly routine method of filling the gap, with about 700,000 new loans every year. Some schools actually include PLUS in their financial aid offers, telling parents they’ve qualified to take out, say, $20,000 in PLUS loans, a rather disingenuous way of saying the actual offer will leave them $20,000 short of the school's official cost of attendance. Colleges with tight budgets have little incentive to tell students they can’t afford to enroll, and strong incentives to encourage students to load up on PLUS loans that pass directly into their coffers. The president of Albany State University in Georgia even admitted at a public hearing that cash-strapped colleges have been steering students from student loans into more onerous and expensive Parent PLUS loans, because they’re required to report default rates for student loans but not for Parent PLUS.

The 2011 controversy over Parent PLUS, when the Obama administration temporarily tightened the program’s lax vetting process, illuminated the extent to which colleges and families have become dependent on the cash. It erupted after the Education Department’s financial aid office finally recognized a longstanding absurdity: the “adverse credit” reviews for PLUS applicants were flagging some delinquent debts, but not debts that were so delinquent they had been sent to collection agencies or written off. As a result, many applicants were getting loans with worse credit than rejected applicants.

“It made no sense,” said Ben Miller, who was a senior policy adviser at the department during the PLUS flap and is now director of post-secondary education at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. “But fixing the problem had a much bigger impact than anyone realized it would.”

Quietly, the department started counting more bad debts in its credit reviews — and PLUS rejection rates soared. Students who couldn’t renew their loans began dropping out of school. And schools that relied heavily on PLUS revenue began hemorrhaging cash. At historically black colleges and universities, which had been particularly hard-hit by the recession, the number of PLUS recipients dropped 45 percent over the next two years, depriving them of an estimated $150 million. Three struggling black colleges—in Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina — ended up shutting their doors, and larger schools like Morehouse endured mass layoffs.

“Our schools were screaming bloody murder,” said Thurgood Marshall College Fund President Johnny C. Taylor Jr., a leading advocate for historically black colleges and universities. “Forget salt — this was pouring acid in our wounds.”

For-profit schools absorbed an even bigger hit, a 54 percent decline in PLUS enrollment. But for obvious political reasons, the black schools (with fierce support from the Congressional Black Caucus) led the fight to get the first African-American president to reverse or at least delay the changes. Taylor and other advocates had several tense meetings with Education Secretary Arne Duncan, repeatedly asking why a two-decade-old snafu had to be corrected immediately, why the tougher reviews couldn’t be limited to new PLUS applicants, why a secretary who had said expanding access to college would be his “North Star” was restricting access to college. Duncan emphasized that the changes weren’t directed at black schools, but Taylor shot back that they were having a disproportionate effect on black schools.

“The secretary kept saying: My lawyers are telling us to do this; we’re doing our best to work it out,” Taylor said. “Give me a break! We were trying to revive a community with double the unemployment rate of the majority community.”

Eventually, Duncan publicly apologized to black college leaders for the abruptness of the changes, acknowledging that “communication internally and externally was poor.” He promised to consider appeals from all rejected PLUS applicants, and launched a process to write new PLUS credit rules.

“It was an operational screw-up of epic proportions,” said Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. “But it was a pretty good reminder that Parent PLUS helps a lot of people pay for college.”

In 2014, the department announced the new PLUS rules, essentially reversing its efforts to tighten credit checks. Bad debts are no longer grounds for rejection if they’re less than $2,085 (versus $500 in the old rule) or less than two years old (versus five years). The department didn’t even require loan counseling for all PLUS borrowers, just those who managed to get loans despite adverse credit.

“It’s a shame. Most parents would be better off taking a second mortgage,” said Natalia Abrams, director of the advocacy group Student Debt Crisis. “Instead, they’re getting trapped. They assume that if the government is offering these loans, they must be safe.”

To my surprise, Taylor told me he agrees. Taylor was probably the most outspoken critic of the administration’s short-lived efforts to rein in Parent PLUS, and he still believes it was unfair to change the rules so suddenly after a brutal downturn. But he asked me not to describe him as a Parent PLUS defender. He said the program is so exploitative that he once investigated a class-action lawsuit, but found that debt-ravaged parents were too ashamed to go public.

“It’s a horrible program, totally out of control,” he said. “We’ve got to figure out a way to make college affordable, but Parent PLUS is definitely not the answer.”

OBAMA'S NEW CONSUMER Financial Protection Bureau has raised alarms about predatory lending by bankers and mortgage brokers. At a recent event, Richard Hunt, the president of the Consumer Bankers Association, posed a question to CFPB Director Richard Cordray: “Why aren’t you doing anything about Parent PLUS?” Cordray replied that he didn’t have jurisdiction over the federal government, but Hunt believes that if one of his members offered a similar loan product with similarly negligible underwriting standards, the bureau would be all over it.

“The silence has been deafening,” Hunt said. “It’s sinister to see the government throw money at people with no clue if they can pay it back.”

Hunt would like to see the private sector — that is, his members — take over the business. And some private lenders are starting to compete with Parent PLUS — one Rhode Island bank is offering a similar product with a much lower interest rate of 3 percent and no origination fees for the most creditworthy borrowers. But while PLUS loans don’t have the same protections as federal student loans, they do include some options most private banks won’t match, like the ability to defer payments for years.

What PLUS lacks is flexibility. Parents who qualify can borrow whatever they need for their kids to attend whatever school they want, while parents who get rejected can’t borrow a dime. In another hearing, an administrator of a North Carolina college shared a sad vignette about a homeless woman who was denied a PLUS loan, implicitly suggesting the government should have extended her virtually unlimited credit. In fact, that’s exactly what would have happened if her credit had been clean. Nobody would have been allowed to try to gauge whether her income or assets gave her any hope of repayment. Parent PLUS suffers from a paradox that also afflicts government loans for agriculture, shipbuilding and just about everything else: It’s highly risky for borrowers who need it most desperately, while the borrowers who could most easily handle the debt could probably get by without it.

Many critics argue that Parent PLUS should be abolished, and that the government should expand Pell grants and raise caps on student loans instead. But even those who want to continue the program — including Rodriguez in the White House and Republican staffers on Capitol Hill — seem to agree there are relatively obvious ways to strengthen it. The most evident would be real underwriting standards to evaluate the ability to pay of potential borrowers. Another would be strict loan caps. Or a combination of those reforms could link the creditworthiness of borrowers to the size of the loans they’re eligible to receive, the kind of calculation real banks make. Even Draeger, who represents aid administrators at 3,000 colleges and universities, said the system needs structural changes to protect vulnerable families.

“We definitely support new underwriting standards. Parents are getting in too deep, and it’s affecting their ability to retire and enjoy life,” he said. “Right now, schools just have to follow the rules, and from a consumer protection standpoint, the rules are dangerous.”

The major obstacle to reform, beyond Washington’s general dysfunction and polarization, is the immense profitability of Parent PLUS. These days, the government borrows money at almost no cost, so lending at 7 percent plus fees can add up: Parent PLUS could reduce the deficit by $3 billion this year. That means any effort to scale it back and restrict it to creditworthy borrowers would cost the government a lot of money. Politicians generally don’t like paying more money to provide fewer benefits, especially when a well-organized political coalition has defended those benefits in the past.

“That’s the perversity of a loan program like this,” one senior GOP aide said. “It makes it that much harder to fix.”

In other words, Washington has become as dependent on Parent PLUS loans as the schools that flack them and the parents who receive them. The status quo has tremendous power, because Congress likes profitable programs, schools like reliable revenue, and parents like to help their kids.

Hill and her husband have another son getting ready to start Ithaca College, just as they’re starting to pay back Aaron’s loan, but they're determined to help out again. They haven't figured out how they're going to do that yet, because there's no way they're going back to the Parent PLUS well again.

“Fool me once, right?” Hill said. “I don’t want to put my kid in a bind, but these loans are ridiculous. The guilt system only goes so far.”

"Trump says 'revved up economy' will pay for budget proposals: Fox WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he believes the extra $54 billion dollars he has proposed spending on the U.S. military will be offset by a stronger economy as well as cuts in other areas. “I think the money is going to come from a revved up economy,” Trump said in a Fox News interview broadcast on Tuesday, hours before he was to address a joint session of Congress. “I mean you look at the kind of numbers we’re doing, we were probably GDP of a little more than 1 percent and if I can get that up to 3 or maybe more, we have a whole different ball game.  It’s a whole different ball game.” ",0
"Against the clock, German parties haggle over immigration, euro budget BERLIN (Reuters) - With just one day left to conclude exploratory talks on forming a new coalition government, German parties were still far apart on Wednesday on the hot issue of immigration and the future governance of the euro zone. Merkel, 63, wants the exploratory talks to end on Thursday, when German media expect her to press all sides to strike a compromise before moving to formal negotiations that could lead to her securing a fourth term as Chancellor. Merkel is hoping to put together an unlikely alliance of her conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the ecologist Greens - a combination untested at national level but a deal which could head off fresh elections. The parties are struggling to reach agreement on the touchy issue of immigration, with the Greens firmly opposed to a conservative plan to cap at 200,000 per year the number of migrants Germany will accept for humanitarian reasons. The parties are also at odds over the number of foreigners who qualify to join relatives granted asylum in Germany. Differences over whether Germany should back a French proposal to create a joint euro zone budget also highlight the difficulties Merkel faces in trying to forge the awkward alliance. A document seen by Reuters, describing a possible government s stance on European issues, contains bracketed sentences reflecting areas of disagreement that must be settled by party leaders on Wednesday.  [The following compromise proposal could not be reached: There is a need for a capacity to buffer extraordinary, unpredictable economic emergency situations which are beyond the control of individual member states...],  one passage reads. Another sentence, described as the FDP position read:  We do not support a fiscal capacity in order to buffer the effects of economic shocks.  The paper contains two alternate phrasings on the banking union, one supported by Merkel s conservatives and the left-leaning Greens, and another with more hardline language backed by the pro-business FDP. THWARTING THE FAR-RIGHT Merkel needs a deal to head off fresh elections that mainstream politicians fear could see the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) make further gains after it surged into parliament for the first time after a September election. Businesses are eager for the parties to reach a deal.  We believe that all parties involved have understood the urgency to reach an agreement by Christmas,  said Dieter Kempf, chief of Germany s largest industry association, the BDI, warning that prolonged uncertainty could hit investment. The mood music coming out of the talks has been mixed. Late on Tuesday, Merkel and other senior conservatives drank wine with Greens co-leader Katrin Goering-Eckardt, conservative party sources said. But the coalition negotiations are complicated by the dynamics within the conservative bloc, which comprises Merkel s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). The CSU, worried about losing support in a state election next year, is uncompromising on immigration - a risk for the three-way  Jamaica  coalition, so-called because the parties  colours match those of the Caribbean country s flag. CSU Secretary General Andreas Scheuer said his party was ready to compromise, but added:  It is becoming ever more clear that Jamaica is not a pleasure trip.  ",0
"Who Tossed On the First Tinsel? Two Baltic Capitals Disagree - The New York Times RIGA, Latvia  —   In the Baltics, there may be no war on Christmas but there’s a pretty prickly one over the tree. For six successive seasons, Riga and Tallinn  —   the capitals of Latvia and Estonia  —   have waged a feud over which was the site of the world’s first decorated Christmas tree. Riga says it was first, in 1510. Tallinn claims a much earlier event, in 1441. More than civic pride is at stake.   travel has become extremely lucrative, especially in the   north, where there are no swaying palms to lure the  . And this year, the rivalry has taken on both an added urgency and a darker tinge. Simmering tensions between Russia and NATO and the faltering Russian economy have squeezed tourist traffic from what had been a prime source of vacationers. And the deadly attack on Berlin’s Christmas market this week has raised fears that holiday markets, in general, may see fewer customers for their hot spiced wine and sugary treats. The Christmas tree spat began in 2010, when Latvians started an advertising campaign that claimed that Riga was the first, citing 1510 as the year when a mysterious and rambunctious medieval brotherhood known as the House of the Black Heads paraded through Riga carrying a constructed replica of a tree. They decorated it with fruits and candles, danced around it and then, a few days later, burned it to the ground. Hold on a second, responded the Estonians. They produced evidence that they claim showed that a similar festival had taken place at yet another lodge of the Black Heads, this one in Tallinn in 1441. And their festival, Estonians claim, involved a real tree. In fact, said the historian Juri Kuuskemaa, “we can be sure it was a spruce. ” Riga’s mayor, Nils Usakovs, countered that claim by saying that the Estonians employ   tactics when it comes to the invention of the Christmas tree. It’s an unusual war, fought with ornaments and historians. “Cities like Berlin had to wait until the 18th century before the first recorded public use of a Christmas tree,” sniffed Mr. Kuuskemaa, 74, who is also the official Herald of Tallinn, a ceremonial position for which he often dons period garb. “And for Paris and London, it didn’t happen until the 19th century. Tallinn and Riga did it centuries before all the great metropolises of Europe. ” Whizzing round the capital the week before Christmas, Mayor Usakovs has taken on the work ethic of an elf. At the foot of a former landfill site that is being converted into a miniature ski resort, Mr. Usakovs lit his 48th Christmas tree of the season. He said the Christmas tree conflict, in reality, had reached a bit of a historical stalemate, as there was not enough contextual evidence to say for certain which city came first. But he doesn’t care. “Any time they say they were first, they have to mention also our city,” he said. “Tourists from Germany or Belgium or Russia don’t care for historical truth they care about cities with fancy Christmas trees, fancy Christmas markets. And when they read that there is also this battle between Tallinn and Riga  —   it’s fun!” Nearly 200 miles north, in Tallinn, the chairman of the Estonian Parliament’s defense committee, Hannes Hanso, stood beside the official parliamentary tree and declared that he took a policy of total nonrecognition when it came to Riga’s claims. “I didn’t know Latvia had any claim to the first Christmas tree,” he said with mock incredulity. Mr. Hanso also reminded Latvians not to get any ideas about who has the highest mountain either, as Estonia’s Big Egg Mountain, at 1, 043 feet, was clearly higher than Latvia’s Gaizinkalns, which reaches to a mere 1, 024 feet. Deployments of elves and reindeer have become the important weapons for Baltic nations to keep tourism levels steady over an otherwise dead season. It is especially important for Latvia and Estonia where, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism’s direct contribution to gross domestic product is twice as big as it is in Lithuania, the southernmost Baltic state. In 2015, in Lithuania it amounted to 1. 7 percent, whereas in Latvia and Estonia it was 4. 1 percent and 3. 9 percent. With the weak ruble keeping many Russian tourists at home, Christmas profits are even more under threat. The Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the birth of Jesus in early January, so the holiday markets could stay open for weeks longer and still find eager crowds. Mariann Lugus, secretary general of the Estonian Travel and Tourism Association, said that Estonia had detected a dip in the number of Russian tourists in January 2014. A year later, though, after the Russian seizure of Crimea and the imposition of international sanctions, Russian tourism plummeted. Only about half as many Russians visited that January. Latvia, for some reason, has not experienced similar drops. “We don’t know why that is,” said Irena Riekstina, secretary general of the Association of Latvian Travel Agents and Tour Operators. “This is probably going to happen at some point and we need to prepare for this. ” Maximilien Lejeune, executive director at European Best Destinations, a travel website, said that the Christmas tree war could end up attracting even more visitors to both cities as they compete for other popular Christmas season destinations like Lapland and Norway  —   especially if tourists become nervous about attending holiday markets in cities that have experienced terrorist attacks. Keen to compete is Remigijus Simasius, the mayor of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Though his city has no claim to the first Christmas tree, he hopes to compete with even larger and more elaborate presentations. He threw down the gauntlet this year with a towering tree adorned with 50, 000 bulbs, which drew wide acclaim. His tree provoked rebukes from Russia, though, where several articles accused the Lithuanians of copying the tree’s design from a smaller one in Moscow’s Red Square. Lithuania may have no claim to the first Christmas tree, Mr. Simasius said in his annual Christmas speech, but it was important to think in broader terms. “We are part of the Baltic Sea region, and we are happy that this tradition is born in our region,” he said. Mr. Lejeune said that “in troubled times, people like to have landmarks,” and that’s what European holiday markets have become. “People also like to escape when the news makes them afraid,” he said. “That’s why magic movies have such success in cinemas. The Christmas markets also allow people to escape a bit from reality. ” But not everyone is in the Christmas spirit. Gustavs Strenga, an archivist and historian at the National Library of Latvia, said that both Riga and Tallinn were guilty of making creative leaps with their historical interpretations. Actually, he said, those   celebrations by the Black Heads had nothing to do with Christmas and were connected to other festivities the brotherhood celebrated. Looking down at his coffee cup, Mr. Strenga admitted that his skeptical position had not gone down well in Latvia. “I’ve been called the Grinch,” he said.",0

"North Korea missile crisis seen pushing South Korea to gun up SEOUL (Reuters) - The escalating threat arising from nuclear-armed North Korea’s recent series of missile tests is prompting South Korea to beef up its military muscle and experts warn it could spur an arms buildup elsewhere in Northeast Asia. South Korea and Japan are accustomed to the North’s frequent threats to attack. But the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang has raised fears of a sudden clash along the world’s most militarised border dividing the two Koreas, which might quickly escalate to all-out war. After North Korea’s second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 28, South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered a speedy deployment of the controversial U.S. THAAD anti-missile defense system, reversing his earlier decision to postpone it pending an environmental review.  This week, the U.S. Defence Department said it was “actively” considering revising bilateral ballistic missile guidelines with South Korea to allow Seoul to build more powerful missiles — at the South’s request. Moon told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation on Monday South Korea also wants to build a nuclear-powered submarine, presidential officials said. “All of this could lead to further militarization of South Korea,” said Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum. South Korea, which spends around a tenth of its annual budget on defense, is already home to some 625,000 local soldiers and more than 28,000 U.S. troops. The country, still technically at war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce and not a peace treaty, has deployed the U.S.-built Patriot missile defense system, as well as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system. Trump warned the North and its leader Kim Jong Un against attacking Guam or U.S. allies on Friday, a day after the isolated country said it was finalizing by mid-August a plan to launch four intermediate range missiles toward waters off the U.S. Pacific territory. “If North Korea actually launches Hwasong-12 missiles towards Guam, they’re going to do it with all their other missiles, artillery and tanks ready for action,” said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University’s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. “And we should be prepared too.” Even before the latest spike in tensions, South Korea was seeking to enhance its missile-defense capabilities in the face of the unprecedented pace of North Korean missile tests. Japan, worried its ballistic missile defenses could be overwhelmed by swarm attacks or circumvented by warheads launched on lofted trajectories, is likely to acquire a ground-based version of the Aegis missile defense system. It is also mulling the acquisition of munitions that would allow it to strike North Korea missile sites. “The greatest threat to both states remains shorter range artillery, artillery rockets and stockpiles of short-to-medium range missiles. The focus will primarily remain upon bolstering defensive rather than offensive capabilities,” said Reed Foster, a defense analyst for IHS Jane’s. “I don’t believe that there will be any significant altering of East Asian procurement strategies, despite the rhetoric emanating from North Korea, principally because for them the threat hasn’t altered drastically,” Reed added. Conservative lawmakers in Seoul in recent days have even called for a “nuclear balance” on the peninsula, saying Seoul should ask Washington to redeploy U.S. nuclear weapons if South Korea is unable to develop its own. The United States withdrew nuclear weapons from South Korea in 1992, when the two Koreas agreed to make the peninsula nuclear free. In violation of that agreement as well as U.N. Security Council resolutions, North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests. “Now is the right time to actively look at bringing back tactical nuclear weapons,” Chung Woo-taik, floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, told Reuters. “North Korea broke the denuclearisation agreement a long time ago.” Reintroducing nuclear weapons remains an unlikely scenario, as that would undermine demands from Seoul and Washington for North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs. For now, officials are instead focused on changing the missile guidelines, which allow Seoul to have ballistic missiles with a flight range capped at 800 km (497 miles), topped with a maximum 500 kg (1,102 pounds) warhead. South Korea is less focused on increasing the flight range, as that could face opposition from neighbors including China, Russia and Japan, and the 800-km range limit covers all of North Korea in any case, senior government officials said. Rather, Seoul wants to double the maximum payload to 1,000 kg or greater, powerful enough to target underground bunkers or nuclear sites within the North, the officials said. That’s still a fraction of the size of “the mother of all bombs”, which the United States dropped on a suspected Islamic State target in Afghanistan in April. The 21,600-pound GBU-43 bomb is one of the largest non-nuclear devices used in combat.    ",0
"Och-Ziff to Pay Over $400 Million in Bribery Settlement - The New York Times Africa once represented a lucrative new market for a giant New York hedge fund. More than a decade later, the hedge fund,   Capital Management, and its founder, Daniel Och, are paying the price for what the United States government has charged were more than $100 million in bribes paid to government officials in Libya, Chad, Niger, Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo to secure natural resources deals and other investments.

E. C. ’s division of enforcement. The settlement caps a nearly   investigation by the Justice Department, the S. E. C. and overseas financial regulators that last month ensnared the son of a former prime minister of Gabon. But it still leaves the door open for action against others who once worked for   prosecutors said. Michael L. Cohen, who led  ’s investments in Africa, is referred to in court filings without his name being used. Mr. Cohen left the firm in 2013. He was also an officer in Africa Management Ltd. a joint venture set up by   to secure African resource contracts. Mr. Cohen worked closely at   with a former associate, Vanja Baros, who is also referred to in court filings from prosecutors but is not named. A representative for Mr. Baros declined to comment on Thursday. Ronald G. White, Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, said his client had “an unblemished reputation built over the course of a career spent creating value for  ’s investors,” adding that he had “done nothing wrong. ” Mr. Frank also declined to comment. The settlement focuses attention on one of the biggest and   hedge funds and one of the few publicly traded firms in the opaque $3 trillion hedge fund universe. “This has been a deeply disappointing episode,” Mr. Och said in an emailed statement, adding: “This conduct is inconsistent with our core values and not representative of our hundreds of employees worldwide, who are dedicated to serving our clients with the utmost integrity. We have learned from this experience and taken significant steps to strengthen  . ” Between 2007 and 2011,   pushed ahead with deals even though some within the firm raised questions about whom it was dealing with in Africa, according to the government. The S. E. C. for instance, said in its administrative order that Mr. Och and Mr. Frank “were aware of corruption accusations” against one partner it was working with in Congo. But the S. E. C. added that neither Mr. Och nor Mr. Frank knew that bribes would be paid. In another instance, an unidentified employee at   emailed Mr. Och to describe an important meeting with Libyan officials, including one of Qaddafi’s sons, in Vienna in 2007. “Meetings are amazing,” the employee wrote. “They have 77 billion, half in cash and no idea who to give it to,” referring to the Libyan Investment Authority, the country’s   sovereign wealth fund. When Mr. Och later inquired about progress, the employee replied: “I thought you were against it so I haven’t pursued it,” adding that  ’s Libyan fixer wanted to follow up. “You O. K. with that?” the employee asked. Mr. Och replied, “I will be O. K. Will call you. ”   first disclosed the Justice Department’s investigation in 2014. Earlier this year, the firm said it was nearing a settlement with the government, setting aside $200 million for a penalty. In August, federal investigators arrested Samuel Mebiame, a Gabonese consultant and son of a former prime minister, on charges that he routinely paid bribes to officials to secure mineral concessions in Niger, Guinea and Chad on behalf of   and its partners in a joint venture called Africa Management Ltd. The joint venture was seen as a new source of returns for  . A global commodities boom was just starting to fade when the venture was created in 2008, but Africa Management Ltd. had big ambitions to acquire assets like exploratory mining and energy concessions. In a statement at the time, Mr. Och said, “We look forward to working together to grow our combined venture and create the leading investment management business in the region. ” One week before Mr. Mebiame’s arrest,   said it was setting aside another $200 million as a provision for a penalty. On Thursday,   executives  —   including Mr. Och  —   committed to put $400 million toward the penalty. The firm faces more challenges ahead. Investors have pulled more than $5. 5 billion out of the hedge fund this year. “It hurts  ’s reputation,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “The legal separation of a parent and its subsidiaries might be important in court, but for reputation it is the brand name that counts, and the brand name is in the headlines. ” As part of the settlement,   will hire an independent monitor. The criminal charges will be dismissed if the firm complies with the terms of the   agreement and does not violate any other laws over the next three years. For the    Mr. Och, the deal with the S. E. C. is an admission of a lack of control and oversight at his firm. Like many titans in the hedge fund industry, Mr. Och began his career at Goldman Sachs before going on to found his own firm in 1994 with a $100 million investment from the Ziff brothers, heirs to a magazine empire. For years a top earner in the hedge fund industry, his net worth is estimated to be $2. 7 billion, according to Forbes. He is part of a small group of financial elite who mingle at Manhattan society events, contribute to the same charities and gather at the exclusive World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland. And   once loomed large in the industry. Just over a decade after Mr. Och founded the firm, it became one of the first hedge fund firms to go public, in 2007. With more than $26 billion in assets under management at the time of its public listing,   quickly grew to manage as much as $48 billion last year. According to the firm’s revolving credit facility  —   terms under which the firm can draw from loans  —   if its assets under management drop below $22 billion for more than two consecutive quarters,   could be declared in default.   was charged with four counts of bribery, but the charges will ultimately be dismissed if the firm complies with the terms of the agreement. The penalty that   faces is not the biggest faced by a hedge for breaking the law. Other hedge funds that have faced criminal charges, like Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital, have been forced to wind down their hedge funds. Mr. Cohen’s SAC paid $1. 2 billion to federal prosecutors as part of an insider trading guilty plea. Prosecutors and the S. E. C. filed hundreds of pages of documents. At a hearing Thursday afternoon, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, noted the extensive nature of the investigation, saying: “I would have you read the charges, but I have dinner plans at 8 p. m. ”",0

"Reflections From Rio - The New York Times Two weeks ago, Pita Taufatofua gained a sudden, if fleeting, international fame. At the opening ceremony of the Rio Games, Taufatofua carried the flag of the tiny South Pacific nation Tonga while shirtless and covered in coconut oil, his sculptured torso gleaming. Besides lighting up the internet, his   appearance earned him a segment on the “Today” show, in which the hosts enthusiastically, and to some controversy, oiled him up. But Taufatofua is fundamentally an athlete. And with the Olympics almost over, he finally got his chance to be an athlete on Saturday morning, in the heavyweight taekwondo competition. Taufatofua was up against it. At 32, he was fighting in his first Olympics after three failed attempts to qualify. His opponent, Sajjad Mardani of Iran, had won a silver medal at the 2013 world championships. Taufatofua saluted the fans when he arrived at the mat. They quickly adopted him, chanting, “Tonga, Tonga. ” Mardani struck quickly. The score was   and then  . Taufatofua gamely attacked, trying punches and spinning kicks. When he scored his one and only point, the crowd exploded, and he raised a fist in triumph. Final score:  . “I lost, and I’m smiling,” Taufatofua said afterward. “I got a point, and it was the happiest point I ever got in my life. ” It is easy to be cynical about the pieties of the Olympics, and some in the skeptical press corps may have found Taufatofua, who works as a counselor for homeless children, too good to be true. But why not end the Games with a dose of Tongan idealism? Taufatofua says his goal is to “bring the world closer together. ” A sincere good luck to him. VICTOR MATHER I was moving around the Maracanã stadium during the opening ceremony when I bumped into performers dressed in   critter costumes in a hall leading to the stands. They had left the field a few minutes before, and with a sign warning cast members not to go into the stands, they were essentially forbidden to watch the opening ceremony that they had helped to make. Still, they seemed enchanted and proud of the ceremony some had teary eyes. I was happy that they broke the rule and got to see a bit of the beautiful show they had helped put on. As it turned out, it was common to see the work force trying to sneak a peek at the Olympics. Ticket prices kept the Games out of reach for   Brazilians, and workers at the Games, well, had to work. But I saw cleaning people off to the side, trying to watch the judoka Rafaela Silva win Brazil’s first gold medal of the Games. SERGIO PEÇANHA I arrived late to a men’s basketball game between Argentina and the United States, and the press section was filled to overflowing. So much the better. I wandered out into the stands and found a seat among the Argentines, who had descended on Rio de Janeiro by the many thousands for this game. I am a lifetime Mets fan, which describes its own sort of insanity, and I found gloriously lunatic and recognizable companions. For two hours, they jumped up and down in unison and sang. They screamed they whistled they cried. And I can say with clinical accuracy that for the first time in my life, as the far bigger American squad asserted its writ and the game slipped away from Argentina, I saw men trying to pull their hair out. Sitting among fans is one of the great joys of the Olympics. In Manaus, in heat so radiant you could all but touch it, I sat among Colombian soccer fans who rained wonderfully creative chants on Hope Solo, the        American goalkeeper. The Brazilians joined in  —   Solo had earlier implied that Brazil could be enjoyed only with a mosquito net and a scarf over the face  —   with chants of “Zika! Zika!” (My interpreter told me of many other wondrously creative insults, almost all of which, unfortunately, cannot be published here.) MICHAEL POWELL News conferences are always overstuffed with reporters and prone to zaniness when Usain Bolt is involved. Just before the Games began, Bolt held a media event in Rio de Janeiro featuring   dancers and a journalist who rapped a question. Late Thursday, after he had won the gold medal in the   dash, Bolt arrived at a news conference room and plopped into a chair between Andre De Grasse of Canada and Christophe Lemaitre of France, who had won silver and bronze. Before the athletes had stepped onto the stage, a press officer for the Olympics had suggested to the dozens of reporters that they play a prank on Bolt by directing questions only to the other runners. The lark lasted for about three questions before a local journalist, who had apparently missed the directive, started to ask Bolt something. The room filled with boos, and then laughter, leaving Bolt with a confused smile. Moments later, another reporter took the microphone. “Usain, let’s imagine Bob Marley is alive,” he began. The reporter wanted to know what Marley, a Jamaica native like Bolt, would have named a song had he written one about Bolt. The crowd broke up again with laughter, but Bolt grinned and took the question in stride. “‘Greatest of All Time,’” he said. ANDREW KEH The Olympics are a realm where displays of grace and boorish behavior occur one after another, and sometimes simultaneously. To wit, the   men’s badminton match between Scott Evans of Ireland and Ygor Coelho de Oliveira of Brazil. Even before a point was scored, history was made: De Oliveira was the first Brazilian man to compete at the Olympics in the sport. He had learned at an academy,   by his father, in a favela not far from where the competition unfolded. Naturally, the stands were chockablock with de Oliveira’s fans. Chants of “Ygor, Ygor” might have been among the most joyful noises made in the last three weeks. But much of the glee was drained from the arena in the first game, which de Oliveira lost,  . Evans’s overhead smash seemed unreturnable. De Oliveira made a few unforced errors. It looked hopeless. But in the second game, de Oliveira elevated his game. He stopped making mistakes and started putting away the shuttlecock with dink shots that barely cleared the net. When he took a commanding lead and then eked out a   win in the second game, his fans were in a state of near hysteria. That proved to be the peak of de Oliveira mania. He lost the third and final game, and it was not close. When the match ended, Evans acted as if he had won the gold and the lottery. He ran in circles. He took off his shirt. He left de Oliveira at the net, waiting for a handshake. It was the kind of obnoxiousness usually seen only in professional wrestling, where performers want to be booed. The Brazilian crowd obliged, of course. But de Oliveira kept his poise, a    mature beyond his years  —   and perhaps already plotting his path to the next Olympics. DAVID SEGAL Soldiers and police officers provided a constant backdrop at the Rio Olympics, and after a while you didn’t pay much attention to their presence. Still, an armed escort for a news media bus was out of the ordinary. When one did appear late on a Saturday night while I was riding back to the press center from an outlying venue, I took notice. What was striking, though, at least to me, was that none of the other two dozen journalists aboard seemed to notice. And what were my fellow members of the news media doing while we traveled along a highway with a soldier or a police officer (hard to say which) on a motorcycle in front of us and a truck filled with soldiers bringing up the rear? Well, some were dozing. (Covering the Olympics is a grind, and it was late.) All the others were looking at their phones. This was the bus line that had gained attention when a window was shattered by something  —   perhaps a bullet, more likely a rock. That may have explained why, days later, we were suddenly getting an escort. It doesn’t explain, of course, why no one else noticed. But did I mention it was late? JAY SCHREIBER Badminton players take their shuttlecocks seriously. The little feathery birds, after all, are critical to the game. I got a sense of this when I wrote about how they are made. Olympic referees and representatives of Yonex, which made the shuttles used in Rio, talked lovingly about them. So I asked where they were kept, assuming they would be in a special   secret vault. I was led behind a giant black curtain that separated the three main courts and the fans from the event organizers and the athletes. Within 50 feet, I came upon a door to a temporary office. I could have scaled the flimsy walls, and there was no roof. Inside was a storage space with a bunch of cardboard boxes holding the shuttlecocks. How dull is that? Still, the sneak peek made me realize how finicky athletes are about their pursuits and their equipment, and how the rest of the world will never fully understand. KEN BELSON Crowds of ticket buyers swelled in one area Wednesday night, but no sporting events were taking place there. Far from the Olympic Park, in the Botafogo neighborhood, a   neoclassical mansion sparkled. Security personnel, some wearing thobes, traditional Qatari men’s tops, directed gawkers to the ticket window. For 20 reais  —   a little more than $6  —   they could find out why so many people had flocked there during the past two weeks. This was part of an entirely separate competition, carried out by large multinational companies and foreign governments looking to promote their causes with hospitality suites. In scale, the Qatari government left all others in the dust, renting a    site that the   Daros Latinamerica Collection, an art exhibitor, owned until last year. The collection sold what is still called Casa Daros to a Brazilian school backed by the billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, a friend of Warren Buffett’s. Inside, Brazilians donned abayas, a type of traditional Qatari women’s garb. A museum feel still prevailed, as several rooms displayed Qatar’s plans for, and the work it has done on, the 2022 World Cup, which it will host. Given the struggles of FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, Qatar is under pressure to defend itself. It was making a hard sale.   guides walked multiple groups of more than a dozen Brazilians through the exhibits. One room even showcased Qatar’s antidoping lab. In the main hall, hundreds of Brazilians sampled Qatari clothes and calligraphy. One area, though, was  : the two fancy restaurants. They were reserved for International Olympic Committee and Qatar Olympic Committee officials and their families. Some things never change. VINOD SREEHARSHA Every morning in the Olympic Park, dozens of reporters gathered in a large meeting room, named Samba, for the daily news conference of the International Olympic Committee. It happened in English, and sometimes partly in Portuguese, with live translation into eight other languages. We collected a lot of facts that never made it into stories: the count of urine samples taken from Olympians (3, 491 as of Friday) the average number of daily visitors to the Olympic Park megastore (85, 000) and the   items there (a plush toy mascot,   and caipirinha shot glasses). Over the weeks, there were questions about the color of the diving pool water (why did it turn green?) the Ryan Lochte incident (why did official stories change?) transportation troubles at the Games (why the shortage of cars and buses?) and the splashy arrest of a top Olympic official who was accused of scalping tickets. Officials answered some of those questions directly. They skillfully deflected others, or declined to respond, they said, for legal reasons. Halfway through the Games, as we settled in for the morning ritual, a reporter turned to me and proclaimed the dodge ball event to be his favorite one of the Olympics. “Which venue is that in?” I asked. “It’s here,” he replied, “in Samba. ” REBECCA R. RUIZ Athletes’ comments are often scripted and anodyne, full of tedious platitudes. As with actors, sometimes you just don’t want to hear their earnest recitations about how they prepared for their roles. So how great it was to see (on TV, not in person) the O’Donovan brothers, Gary and Paul, of Ireland,   with excitement after winning their silver medal in the lightweight double sculls? It was their country’s first rowing medal, and its first medal in Rio. Interviewed by Irish television, the two mused on the novelty of the medal process  —   they got to wear “podium pants,” whatever those are, for the ceremony  —   and the strange exigencies of the postrace doping test. “I was trying to take a pee in a cup for them, and I drank about 10 liters of water,” Paul O’Donovan said. “I’m quite full, to be honest. ” They talked about how hungry they were. “We haven’t had anything to eat since two hours ago, when we had bread rolls and some Nutella,” Gary O’Donovan said. They said they were sorry not to be back home at the pub in Lisheen, in a rural part of County Cork, where their friends were celebrating their victory. Paul, who had caused earlier   delight by describing his rowing technique as “close the eyes and pull like a dog,” added that the two actually enjoyed giving interviews. In a competition too full of   preening egotists, this was the best comment of all. “We are just excited that we have other people to talk to apart from ourselves,” he said. SARAH LYALL On my way to interview an International Olympic Committee official in the organization’s luxury hotel on the beach, I hopped into an Uber. The car was nice. Leather seats. Little candies in the cup holder. The driver, who was wearing a suit, offered me water or juice from a cooler on the front seat. “Do you need anything to make the drive more comfortable?” he asked in nearly perfect English. I complimented him on his professionalism and service. Many Uber drivers in Rio, he explained, are businessmen who lost their jobs in the recession. Just before the Olympics, he said, he was laid off from his position at a global technology company. He had worked in the United States for several years. Now he was driving to make ends meet. His Uber car was actually his wife’s car because he considered his own vehicle too expensive to use. The windows on that car were bulletproof because his drive to work had been so dangerous. He would not be attending any Olympic events, he said. Not enough cash for that. He dropped me off at the hotel, where I had to go through tight security to enter the building. I. O. C. members are receiving $900 per diem payments, according to news reports. The dichotomy between life at the I. O. C. and life here was glaring. JULIET MACUR Olympic pin trading might someday become a medal sport at the Games, but for now it’s a great way to meet people from different countries and take on the adventure of haggling in different languages. And really, for me, the Olympics are all about meeting people. So when a young Brazilian was determined to give me an Estonia pin for my beautiful Canada pin (in the shape of a maple leaf) I had to say no. You see, there was a story behind the Canada pin, which I relayed to my potential new trading partner. The woman who had given me the pin had said she would do so if I did a handstand. I explained that my handstand days were long past (actually, they never existed). We had a good laugh, and we worked out a deal for a New York Times pin. That little interlude made the pin more valuable to me because I had that story to tell. I could see that the young man was disappointed, so I offered him a more bland Canada pin I had obtained earlier. He wasn’t interested, and off we went in opposite directions. A few minutes later, he tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Let’s make a story. ” JIM LUTTRELL Katie Ledecky was talking about Bruce Gemmell, her swimming coach since the fall of 2012, when her voice cracked and tears welled in her eyes. It was after her last race, the   freestyle, in which she had shattered her world record for her fifth medal, and her fourth gold. With her Summer Games finally done, Ledecky seemed to realize that the childhood chapter of her life was also coming to a close. In a few weeks, she would be leaving home in Bethesda, Md. for her freshman year at Stanford. The magnitude of the week that was behind her and the year that stretched in front of her  —   new coast, new coach, new school, new team, new friends  —   appeared to overwhelm Ledecky, who began to cry as she sat on the interview dais, flanked by the silver medalist Jazmin Carlin and the bronze medalist Boglarka Kapas. As Ledecky struggled to regain her composure, Carlin reached over and petted her arm, as if to console her. Never mind that Ledecky had beaten Carlin by 11 seconds at that moment, Ledecky had never looked less like a swimming machine. KAREN CROUSE",0
"Immigrants Head to Washington to Rally While Obama Is Still There - The New York Times Nine busloads of immigrant activists from Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island will depart before dawn for the trip to Washington, intent on making their voices heard. They will be blasting protest playlists while carrying posters and flags, from the familiar rainbow to the worn colors of Haiti. But they are not going to the better known Women’s March on Washington, planned for Jan. 21, the day after Donald J. Trump’s inauguration. Instead, they are headed to the nation’s capital on Saturday for a more modest rally focused on the rights of immigrants, called We Are Here to Stay and scheduled to start at 11 a. m. at the Metropolitan A. M. E. Church. For these groups, there was a practical, if not urgent, reason to hold the rally on Jan. 14: Barack Obama will still be president. “As an organizer, the 14th is a date that I feel safe mobilizing people to Washington,” said Natalia Aristizabal, of Make the Road New York, one of the rally’s sponsors. “We don’t know what’s going to happen after the inauguration. ” National and local organizers said they were concerned about the possibility of undocumented protesters being arrested during the new administration, especially since Mr. Trump said he planned to deport the two million to three million undocumented immigrants that he said had criminal convictions. Cristina Jiménez, the executive director of United We Dream, the national organization promoting the interests of undocumented youth known as dreamers, called the threat to immigrant communities “imminent” and added: “To be quite frank, we fear the worst. ” That is not to say that immigrants will be avoiding the women’s march. Some organizations, like United We Dream and the New York Immigration Coalition, are partners in both, and there is other overlap. New York’s   Association, which is led by Linda Sarsour, is also a sponsor of the Women’s March, of which Ms. Sarsour is one of the main organizers. Part of the mission statement of the Women’s March calls on “immigrants of all statuses” to attend, but that event has a broader platform that includes issues of pay equity, reproductive rights and safety from domestic violence. Organizers of the immigrant rally said that their protest aims to highlight the disparate groups who make up their movement, and who represent the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the United States. “It’s of the immigrant community, of people of color, it’s broader than people who are first generation,” said Muzna Ansari, 28, the immigrant policy manager for the New York Immigration Coalition. A child of Indian immigrants, she is Muslim. “It’s a moment of connection, too. There are black immigrants who we don’t talk about. ” Ninaj Raoul, a founder and executive director of Haitian Women for Haitian Refugees, said she had seen the immigration rights movement focus on the   Latino community since the 2012 election. But black immigrants, who are far less likely to be undocumented, have pressing issues of their own, she said. “Now more than ever it’s important for the Haitian voice to be heard in this movement,” Ms. Raoul said. “Not just for the incoming government, where we have so many reasons to be worried, but for the current government because of the actions they’ve taken on Haitian immigrants. ” Over the last several months more than 80 Haitian immigrants have walked into her Brooklyn office seeking help, she said, anguished by the shifting American policy that has left them separated from family members. And those living in the city because of temporary protection granted after their country’s 2010 earthquake do not know how long that will last. Migrants from Haiti have flooded the southern border of Mexico since last spring, many making dangerous journeys through nine countries after fleeing South America. In September, the Obama administration detained Haitians at the U. S.  border arriving without visas and ordered deportations. Some pregnant women and mothers with children were given a temporary humanitarian reprieve to stay, but their husbands were deported. After Hurricane Matthew struck in early October, the administration delayed deporting Haitians, but then resumed deportations in November. For Haitians who have been living in the United States with temporary protection granted after the earthquake, that status that is set to expire in July. Ms. Raoul said that because Hurricane Matthew damaged food supplies, those Haitians did not know if they could return. So Haitian immigrants are going to Washington to appeal to Mr. Obama while they still can. They want him to take executive action to grant Haitian migrants at the southern border permission to temporarily enter the United States on humanitarian grounds, and to extend the temporary protections for another 18 months. Ms. Raoul plans to bring 10 Haitian immigrants, and their country’s flag, to Washington. They will take the bus from Sunset Park with 55 young people representing Atlas: D. I. Y. which serves undocumented immigrant youth in the neighborhood. Michelina Ferrara, the deputy director of Atlas, plans to blast her “revolutionary playlist,” with RB and   artists, both on the bus speakers and from her fanny pack. For those not traveling to Washington on Jan. 14, immigrant actions are also planned in 50 other cities. The New York Immigrant Coalition will be kicking off a statewide campaign called This is Our New York with events in Union Square Hempstead, on Long Island and the Hudson Valley. By then, Kathia Gutierrez, 48, will be in Washington with her daughter, Kathya, 29. They arrived 16 years ago from Bolivia. Kathya works as a nanny, saving money for college she can work legally because of President Obama’s program giving certain rights to undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children by their parents. Kathia, her mother, is an activist for Make the Road New York and is going to Washington to deliver a message for   Trump: “Look out for the youth. ” They will be joined by others fighting for their own subset of immigrant rights, including Alexis Pampillón, 44, an Argentine immigrant who identifies as gender nonconforming he and 20 others members of Make the Road’s L. G. B. T. Q. rights group will be leaving from Queens. Make the Road’s members, drawn from places including Bridgeport, Conn. Elizabeth, N. J. and Pennsylvania, will fill eight buses. Not all will fit into the church in Washington, which has a capacity of about 2, 500. More than 3, 000 protesters are expected, organizers said. Some, said Ms. Aristizabal of Make the Road, will stand outside with signs in Spanish and English: “Aquí Estamos y no Nos Vamos,” and “We are Here to Stay. ” That slogan is familiar, she said, adding, “But it has never been so much of a declaration of defiance. ”",0
"Factbox - German coalition watch: We want experiment to succeed - CDU BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel won a fourth term in office in the German national election on Sept. 24, but a fractured vote that brings the far-right into parliament means she must try to work out a three-way coalition untested at federal level. The new alliance would comprise Merkel s conservative bloc - her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) - along with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens. Such a tie-up is called a  Jamaica  coalition, because the three parties  colors of black, yellow and green match those of the Jamaican flag. To secure a coalition deal, the unlikely bedfellows must overcome differences on issues from immigration to Europe, tax and the environment.  Exploratory talks between the conservative bloc and FDP and separately the conservatives and the Greens took place on Wednesday. On Thursday the FDP and Greens meet before all four parties get together for the first time on Friday. Following are remarks on the possible coalition from senior officials:  We will not manage without compromises.   My impression is that all the participants want the experiment to succeed but also know how difficult it is to come together.   It is our job to make something constructive out of our differences. No formulaic compromises but solutions.    The road to Jamaica is long.  After CDU/CSU, FDP exploratory talks:  It was a good exchange, at times nice and above all mutually respectful and joyful.   It is totally conceivable that before Christmas or in January we say that the whole thing is pointless and we ll talk to the Social Democrats (SPD).  We are open, we are constructive and creative - but also resolute in areas that are important to us.  Put the chances of  a  Jamaica  coalition succeeding at 50/50.  It can succeed. The most important thing is that trust needs to be built between participants, and that takes time. That s why it would be illusory to believe we could conclude negotiations by Christmas.   No one would understand it if the new government does not pass an immigration law.  We need a mix of humanity and order. We Greens also want to secure the EU s external borders and build a sensible database of fingerprints.  This (the CDU/CSU immigration pact) is an agreement between the CDU and CSU, and far from the result of exploratory talks for a coalition with the FDP and Greens.   No party can expect the others to accept its original wording without changes ... But I believe that a signal about limiting immigration on humanitarian grounds will ultimately make its way into the coalition agreement.   Europe s fiscal policy needs a shift away from austerity toward a common pact for tax collection and investments, which would trigger social and ecological innovations.   A red line for us in coalition talks is the mutualisation of debt in Europe, the creation of new pots of money.  In a monetary union where the deficit rules of Maastricht are respected, there is no need for permanent rescue funds.   What we Christian Democrats call  preservation of Creation  overlaps a lot with what the Greens call a sustainable approach to nature.   There can only be a Jamaica tax concept if it includes the end of the solidarity surcharge without taking that money out of people s pockets somewhere else.   The chancellery and the finance ministry should be politically separate. A Greens, a CSU or an FDP finance minister - anything would be better than leaving the finance ministry in CDU hands.  ",0
"Why the Italy Quake Was So Severe - The New York Times The combination of a shallow fault and old, unreinforced masonry buildings led to widespread devastation in the earthquake that struck central Italy early Wednesday. The  .2 quake killed at least 241 people and left hundreds more injured. Many people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings. Like other villages and towns in the mountainous area, Amatrice, where the mayor lamented that “half the town no longer exists,” has stone churches and other buildings that were constructed centuries ago, when little if anything was known about earthquakes. Unless they have been reinforced in recent years, such structures are easily damaged or destroyed by shaking. “Even 100 years ago, they didn’t know how to build structures to withstand earthquakes,” said David A. Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at the Open University in Milton Keynes, England. The earthquake was less powerful than many recent deadly quakes. The  .8 earthquake that struck Nepal in April 2015, for instance, killing 8, 000 people, released roughly 250 times more energy. But the Italian quake was very shallow: According to the United States Geological Survey, it occurred about six miles below the surface. “Shallow earthquakes cause more destruction than deep earthquakes because the shallowness of the source makes the   at the surface worse,” Professor Rothery said. Video from Amatrice and other towns near the quake center showed heaps of masonry rubble from buildings that had been shaken apart. Earthquakes are set off by the movement of the earth’s crust, which is divided into large sections called tectonic plates. The Apennine Mountains, where the quake occurred on Wednesday, are in an area where one plate, the African, is moving under another, the Eurasian. Because of the complex interaction between the plates, the basin of the Tyrrhenian Sea, off Italy’s west coast, is spreading. It is this spreading, and the tension it creates in the Apennines, that led to the quake. The area of Wednesday’s temblor experienced significant earthquakes in the past, including one with a magnitude of 6. 3 near the town of L’Aquila in 2009 that killed at least 295 people, injured more than 1, 000 and left 55, 000 homeless. The two quakes had much in common in terms of genesis and depth,” said Massimo Cocco, a geologist with the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Rome. After the 2009 quake, seven members of a national commission on risk prevention were arrested on charges of failing to adequately warn L’Aquila about the earthquake risk. They were found guilty of manslaughter in 2012 and sentenced to six years in prison, but they were cleared in 2014 by an appeals court. Mr. Cocco said that Italy had   construction laws for new buildings, but that little has been done to reinforce existing buildings. “Resilience is just too low compared to the frequency and the high impact of natural phenomena,” he said.",0
"Treasury's Mnuchin: China may face new sanctions on North Korea WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that if China doesn t follow the United Nations sanctions approved on North Korea, he will seek new financial sanctions on Beijing to cut off access to the U.S. financial system.  Mnuchin told a conference broadcast on CNBC that China agreed to  historic  sanctions on North Korea on Monday in a UN Security Council vote.  If China doesn t follow these sanctions, we will put additional sanctions on them and prevent them from accessing the U.S. and international dollar system, and that s quite meaningful,  Mnuchin said.

"U.S. sees increased activity by Chinese bomber aircraft: officials WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is aware of a higher-than-usual level of activity by Chinese bomber planes, signaling a possible heightened state of readiness, U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday, but downplayed concerns and left open a range of possible reasons. None of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested alarm or signaled that they knew the precise reason for such Chinese activity. Those possibilities include defensive exercises or Chinese concerns over North Korea. U.S. officials have long speculated that North Korea could soon stage another nuclear test or carry on with missile tests. The comments to Reuters came before U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday cited, without explanation, “some very unusual moves” that he said had been taken over the last two or three hours. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to.  Trump was speaking about Chinese activities to put pressure on Pyongyang when he said:  “Some very unusual moves have been made over the last two or three hours and I really have confidence that the (Chinese) president will try very hard. We don’t know whether or not they’re able to do that but I have absolute confidence that he will be trying very very hard,” Trump said. Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has rebuffed admonitions from sole major ally China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. ",0
"Samantha Bee Mocks Trump, Roasts Media at ’Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner’ - Breitbart (Adult Language Warning)  Liberal comedian Samantha Bee roasted the news media, past presidents, and President Donald Trump during a taped mock White House Correspondent’s Dinner Saturday afternoon in Washington, D.

"Hillary Clinton agrees to provide private e-mail server to FBI Hillary Rodham Clinton’s attorney has agreed to provide the FBI with the private server that housed her e-mail during her four years as secretary of state, Clinton’s presidential campaign said Tuesday.

Her attorney also has agreed to give agents a thumb drive containing copies of thousands of e-mails that Clinton had previously turned over to the State Department.

The FBI has been looking into the security of Clinton’s unusual private system, which has emerged as an issue in her campaign amid growing questions from Republicans and some U.S. intelligence officials about whether government secrets might have been put at risk.

The development in the FBI inquiry came the same day that a top intelligence official whose office has been reviewing some of Clinton’s e-mails informed congressional leaders that top-secret information had been contained in two e-mails that traveled across the server.

The finding, contained in a letter sent to leaders of key oversight committees, marked the first indication from government officials that information regarded as top secret — the government’s highest category of security designation — may have passed across Clinton’s server while she led the State Department.

A State Department spokesman late Tuesday described the top-secret designation as a recommendation and said they had not been marked classified at the time, but said staffers “circulated these e-mails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011 and ultimately some were forwarded to Secretary Clinton.”

Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said Tuesday night that Clinton is cooperating with the FBI probe. He declined to say whether the FBI ordered that she turn over the devices and when her attorney, David Kendall, had done so.

“She directed her team to give her e-mail server that was used during her tenure as secretary to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her e-mails already provided to the State Department,” Merrill said. “She pledged to cooperate with the government’s security inquiry, and if there are more questions, we will continue to address them.”

The inquiry by the FBI is considered preliminary and appears to be focused on ensuring the proper handling of classified material. Officials have said that Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, is not a target.

The FBI’s efforts have included contacting the Denver-based technology firm that helped manage the Clintons’ unusual private ­e-mail system.

Clinton has resisted relinquishing control of the server. In March, she said the server contained “personal communications from my husband and me.”

“I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private,” she said then, in response to a question from a reporter about whether she would allow an independent party to examine the device

Clinton turned over more than 30,000 e-mails from the account to the State Department in December, and the agency is vetting those messages for release to the public. She has said that she deemed an additional 32,000 ­e-mails to be personal and chose not to keep them.

Kendall told a congressional oversight committee in a letter that there was “no basis” to support a third-party examination of the server. He indicated that he had confirmed with IT staffers that no e-mail sent or received by Clinton’s account while she was secretary of state remained on the server or backup systems associated with the system. “Thus, there are no hdr22@clintonemail.com emails from Secretary of State Clinton’s tenure on the server for any review, even if such a review were appropriate or legally authorized,” he wrote.

Meanwhile Tuesday, 17 House and Senate members from both parties were informed about the presence of “top secret” information on the Clinton e-mail system in a letter from the inspector general for the intelligence community, I. Charles McCullough III. The letter was first reported Tuesday by the McClatchy news service.

Much of the classified information in the e-mail conversations originated with the CIA, according to two government officials familiar with the records. Some of the information was deemed to be classified by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s classification guidelines. The information included references to information related to satellite images and electronic communications, according to the officials.

The findings by McCullough stemmed from his office’s review of a sample of 40 of Clinton’s ­e-mails. Previously, he had said that the sample included four classified e-mails, but on Tuesday he adjusted his assessment — saying that intelligence agencies deemed two of those e-mails to have contained top-secret information.

McCullough has asked for access to all of the e-mails to conduct a more thorough review but was denied by State Department officials in July.

Last week, State Department spokesman John Kirby said that while the agency was working to “resolve whether, in fact, this material is actually classified, we are taking steps to ensure the information is protected and stored appropriately.”

McCullough also located two e-mails that included classified material from among a separate batch of 296 related to the 2012 attacks on U.S. outposts in Benghazi. One of those e-mails had been publicly released by the State Department, causing consternation within the intelligence community.

He has also located one additional e-mail in the sample of 40 that was classified at the time it was sent but has since been declassified, suggesting that there is no longer a reason to protect the information or that it has since become public, two people familiar with the finding said.

McCullough also told lawmakers that his reviewers found two e-mails they believe contain information that the State Department considers classified, and they have alerted the agency so it can conduct its own review.

All told, McCullough has pointed to seven e-mails that he said contained classified information, including two with top-secret material.

His findings appear to contradict Clinton’s earlier comments.

“I am confident that I never sent or received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received,” she told reporters last month in Iowa.

Clinton said she had “no idea” which e-mails have caught McCullough’s attention.",0
"Powerful Mexico former union boss granted house arrest MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The powerful former leader of Mexico s largest teacher s union, Elba Esther Gordillo, will be let out of jail under house arrest more than four years after her detention on embezzlement charges, government and judicial sources said on Friday. Gordillo, 72, was unexpectedly arrested in 2013 in the first year of President Enrique Pena Nieto s government, in what appeared to show the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) taking a stand against corruption. But the attorney general (PGR) this week stopped fighting Gordillo s lawyer s attempts to get her out of prison, and a tribunal approved, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The judicial source said that in a matter of hours or days she would be allowed to go home. The decision to let Gordillo see out her trial under house arrest came as the political party she founded, the New Political Alliance Party (Panal), said it would back the PRI in the 2018 election.

"U.S. Democratic Party says more documents leaked, blames Russians  (This 13th September story was refiled to correct the headline and first paragraph to make clear more documents released from earlier breach, not a new hack) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday the organization had been hacked by Russian state-sponsored agents who were trying to influence the U.S. presidential election and they may have released more documents after a similar leak in July roiled the party. A link to the documents was posted on WikiLeaks’ Twitter account and attributed to alleged hacker Guccifer 2.0. The release came during a presentation on Tuesday from a person speaking on behalf of Guccifer 2.0 at a London cyber security conference, Politico reported. Reuters could not immediately access the documents.  “There’s one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that’s (Republican presidential nominee) Donald Trump,” DNC interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement. “Not only has Trump embraced (Russian President Vladimir)Putin, he publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign,” she said. Trump in July invited Russia to dig up emails from Clinton’s time as secretary of state, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. He later said he was speaking sarcastically. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chair on the eve of July’s Democratic National Convention after WikiLeaks published an earlier trove of hacked DNC emails that showed party officials favoring eventual nominee Hillary Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the party’s nominating contests. Three other senior officials also stepped down from the DNC after the leak. “We have been anticipating that an additional batch of documents stolen by Russian agents would be released,” said Brazile, who took over from Wasserman Schultz on an interim basis. Democratic Party sources said the party and Clinton’s presidential campaign were deeply concerned about possible publication by WikiLeaks or other hackers of a new torrent of potentially embarrassing party information ahead of the Nov. 8 election.

"Factbox: Republicans' Obamacare plan would dump Medicaid expansion, taxes (Reuters) - After months of internal discord, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday were still trying to craft a bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, a law they have been attacking since it was enacted in 2010. Two attempts in recent weeks to pass an overhaul bill have collapsed in confusion, with conservatives pushing for a more complete repeal and moderates keen to avoid going too far for fear of angering their constituents. Obamacare brought health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. The first version of the Republican bill, known as the American Health Care Act, or AHCA, would have left 24 million more Americans without coverage, according to an estimate by nonpartisan congressional researchers. The House has recently added two amendments to the AHCA to try to appease both conservatives and moderates. Here are the latest versions of the bill’s main provisions:  The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacare’s most popular provisions. It would allow young adults to stay on their parents’ health plan until age 26 and it would ban insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage. An amendment introduced by moderate Republican Representative Tom MacArthur would let states opt out of Obamacare’s mandate that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. It would also allow states to opt out of Obamacare’s requirement that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity care and mental health treatment.  The measure would provide states with $100 billion, largely to fund high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. An amendment added Wednesday would provide another $8 billion over five years to help those with pre-existing conditions pay for health insurance. The bill would let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. The Republicans want to end in 2018 Obamacare’s income-based tax credits that help low-income people buy insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels. While Obamacare’s credits gave more help to those with lower incomes, the Republican plan would be largely age-based. The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as “Cadillac” plans. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep. The bill would also repeal the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans. It would repeal the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.  Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states chose not to expand. After that date, expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover some Obamacare-mandated essential health benefits, fulfilling a Republican promise to return more control to the states. ",0
"Minority Youths Mistrust Police. A Brooklyn High School Has a Plan. - The New York Times On a chilly morning in November, Lt. Donzel Cleare of the New York Police Department stood in front of a classroom at Liberation Diploma Plus High School in Coney Island and asked a simple question: “How many of you guys feel that I work for you?” Before him, in desks arranged around three sides of the room, sat roughly 15 students, mostly male, with a group of girls gathered together on one side. Most of them were black or Hispanic, and because Liberation is a   transfer school, virtually all of them had dropped out or fallen behind at other schools. Not a single student raised a hand. A few actually laughed. They were there at the beginning of a monthslong course, conceived by Liberation’s founding principal, April Leong, as an experiment in bridging the gap between New York City’s police and young people from a poor, minority community in Brooklyn. An elective class called the Junior Citizens Police Academy, it met weekly and was made up of students selected by Ms. Leong, in some cases because they had expressed negative feelings about the police. It is a common sentiment in the neighborhood around Liberation. The 60th Precinct, which includes Coney Island, has nine public housing projects, some with   feuds between their residents. Last year there were 23 shootings in the precinct. This year, as of Aug. 28, there were nine  —   half as many as there were by this time last year, though it is unclear why the total is down. A number of Liberation’s students have had friends or family members killed. Some have watched fathers, brothers or friends go to prison. Others have themselves been incarcerated. Two years ago, Manuel Ocampo, an    student, was shot in the head and killed by a retired police officer. The police said that Mr. Ocampo had a gun and was trying to rob the former officer and steal his car. The shooting was determined to be   and the former officer was not charged. The week before he died, Mr. Ocampo had given a short speech at school, thanking his mother and Ms. Leong for helping him to turn his life around. Ms. Leong keeps a photograph of him on the wall next to her desk. It is no surprise that many of Ms. Leong’s students are suspicious of and hostile to the police. They are mostly resigned to the idea that officers will never be held accountable for what the students see as mistreatment of black people. Lieutenant Cleare, the commanding officer of the housing bureau’s community affairs unit, said later that he knew what the students’ response would be before he even asked the question, but he saw it as a way to get them talking. “It was very important when I came in there to let them voice their true feelings and opinions and concerns,” he said. “I didn’t want them to feel that this was going to be a brainwashing session. ” But the skepticism he faced from the students was   especially about the idea that community residents should help the police stop crime. “That’s not going to happen,” a young man named Jahkhil said at the end of the first class. (He, like most of the other students, is being identified by only his given name at the school’s request, so that the details of their lives don’t affect their future opportunities.) “It’s just a rule  —   you just don’t snitch,” he said. “You can’t snitch. ” The consequences for those who do are clear. “You going to be looked at a certain type of way,” he added, “and certain people are going to want to kill you. ” As politicians, police officials, civil rights activists and others talk about how to change relationships between the police and poor minority communities, there has been little discussion of what role schools might play. The city’s Education Department has made some modest efforts. In May, more than 300 elementary schools received visits from officers from their local precincts, who read to students or led physical education classes or other activities. But there was little preparation, and the program was not aimed at neighborhoods where mistrust of the police is most pervasive. On July 14, after the shootings of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, and then of five police officers in Dallas, New York City’s schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, sent a letter to principals, teachers and other department staff members asking for lesson plans to address topics of civil rights, guns and violence. She also asked for suggestions about how schools could develop relationships with local police precincts. But few if any schools have attempted a program as intense as the one at Liberation. Ms. Leong and Lieutenant Cleare plan to repeat the class this year, with more field trips and   activities. Over the   course, they intend to have the students tour the 60th Precinct’s station house and the new headquarters of the local housing police unit, Police Service Area 1. Liberation occupies a former Catholic school building on the corner of West 19th Street and Mermaid Avenue. Its enrollment varies throughout the year but hovers around 200 students. More than half of the students are black, and close to a third are Hispanic. Eighty percent qualify for free lunch. At their former schools, these students slipped through the cracks. Ms. Leong’s goal is to not let that happen again. For her students, not graduating from high school means facing grim life prospects. According to the Brookings Institution, a research organization based in Washington, black men born in the late 1970s who did not graduate from high school had a nearly 70 percent chance of being imprisoned by their  . That was higher than their chances of being employed. For both male and female students, not completing high school means a high likelihood of a lifetime of poverty. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2014, black high school dropouts age 25 and older had a median weekly income of $440. Female high school dropouts of all races fared even worse, with a median weekly income of $409. Some observers have identified what they call a “   pipeline,” in which young black and Hispanic men are funneled into the criminal justice system by punitive school disciplinary standards. When Ms. Leong heard last year that a    drug addict had fatally shot a police officer in East Harlem, her first thought was about school. She wondered what New York City schools the man, Tyrone Howard, had attended and what chances were missed to put him on a better path in life. Her approach is shaped by her own background. She was born in Brooklyn to a    mother and a    father. She did well academically but was pregnant by the time she graduated from high school. She often tells students about how she took her infant son to her orientation at Baruch College because she didn’t have a babysitter. When she saw other students staring at her and whispering, she wanted to leave and never come back  —   just as they might feel out of place when they get to college, she tells them. But her adviser in a program for   students encouraged her, and she stayed, graduating and ultimately becoming a teacher and then an administrator. She started Liberation in 2007. The son she had at 18 went to Yale, and her younger son is now a student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Lieutenant Cleare, 47, who is black, grew up in Rosedale, a suburban section of southeast Queens. Like the students at Liberation, he said, he and his friends didn’t like the police officers in their neighborhood, most of whom were white. “They would be using the   they would be slamming you up against walls,” he said. He went to York College in Queens, where he was the captain of the basketball team. After York, even though friends and cousins who had become police officers tried to persuade him to join the force, he took a job as a high school drug counselor. He finally became an officer when he was 29. He has spent 14 of his 18 years on the force doing youth development and community outreach. At Liberation, he approached the students as something of a father figure. But if the divide between black communities and the police is often characterized as a confrontation between black and blue, Lieutenant Cleare was clearly speaking from the blue side. “When there’s shooting around your way  —   ’cause there’s shootings all the time  —   when people are running away from the gunfire, who’s running toward the gunfire?” he asked. “Cops,” the students said. “Does it happen in a white neighborhood?” No, the students conceded. He acknowledged that not all officers were model public servants. “I’m going to say that to you right now: There’s a bunch of idiots out there,” Lieutenant Cleare said the first day. But over the months he did not engage in deep discussions about misconduct or police brutality, and as the students sometimes pointed out, he tended to put the onus for improving the relationship on them. He compared getting stopped by the police to being robbed at gunpoint and asked why people did not respond to commands from an officer as they would to orders coming from any other person with a gun. “Your most important priority when you get into an interaction with the Police Department is to leave the same way you came,” he said. “Just like the robber comes to you and says, ‘Yo, run that,’”  —   he demonstrated demanding someone’s money  —   “your whole goal is to walk away safe and sound. ” But instead, he said, people often talked back to the police. Lieutenant Cleare explained: “You think  —   and this is what’s crazy  —   on one hand, you think, Oh, it’s just a cop. There’s a certain level of trust. That’s why you can disrespect that officer, because you feel, at the end of the day, ‘You just a cop  —   you got that badge and gun, but you’re really not going to use it. ’” The students were not buying it. “Talking is different than touching somebody,” Bobby, 19, objected. “I can say whatever I want, ’cause it’s only my mouth  —   freedom of speech  —   but you can’t touch me. ” Another student, Shanell, said, “You’re saying because they have guns, because they have badges, we can just be disrespected!” “No!” Lieutenant Cleare said, throwing up his hands in frustration. At times, their views of the world seemed unbridgeable. Lieutenant Cleare said residents of Coney Island did not do enough to stop crime, because they refused to talk to the police. “You basically want people to start snitching,” Bobby said. “Define what a snitch is, Bobby,” Lieutenant Cleare responded. “Someone not intimidated to communicate  —   that’s what Ms. Leong told us,” Shanell said, sounding dubious. “Once we snitch, who come in guns blazing for us?” Lieutenant Cleare encouraged them to take the first step and be friendly to the scared rookie officer on the street. In a class in January, he said most officers would be dumbfounded if the students said a simple “Good morning” or “Be safe, officer. ” He went on, “How am I supposed to know that you’re a good guy unless you show me?” Bobby wondered why things couldn’t run the other way. “How about if you show me something, I show you something?” he asked. “How we always got to show you something and you can’t show us anything?” Bobby was a star of Liberation’s basketball team and the unofficial ringleader of the policing class. The other students listened closely to him, and he delighted in making them erupt in laughter. He lived in a nearby housing project and was the youngest of 10 children, one of eight brothers. He transferred to the school from Abraham Lincoln High School in fall 2014, when he should have been a senior. He broke his ankle in the winter of his sophomore year and skipped most of the rest of the year, he said. Bobby said he was uneasy around the police in part because he had seen one of his older brothers arrested inside their apartment when he was around 8. “I see one cop with a gun to his head, and one cop having him lay down with his knee in his back,” he recalled. “I thought I was about to see him die right in front of me or something  —   it was crazy. ” His brother went to prison for five years, though Bobby wasn’t sure what the charges were. “I think for robbery and assault,” he said. That experience, he said, was one reason he would never inform on someone to the police. “If you tell on somebody,” he said in January, “they got a whole family that they probably had to provide for in a situation where, in the streets, it’s hard. ” And yet his own family had been victimized by violent crime. His eldest brother, then 29, was shot and killed the previous school year. Bobby had been willing to give Lieutenant Cleare a chance partly because he trusted Ms. Leong so much. She had supported him after the killing. According to the police, his brother was visiting a female friend on Staten Island when her former boyfriend showed up they argued and the man shot him. Ms. Leong and two other staff members went to the funeral. Bobby said he had gone a little crazy for a while, thinking about tracking the man down and shooting him with his brother’s gun, but his surviving brothers talked him out of it. The man was arrested and indicted on a count of   murder, among other charges. He is currently on Rikers Island and awaiting trial. But Bobby said he would have preferred that the man hadn’t been arrested. He would have preferred that he be dead. At Liberation, violence never seemed to be far away. In   the cousin of one student was murdered in East New York, Brooklyn. The next day, another man was found dead behind one of the Coney Island projects, in what some suspected was retaliation. The week after the killings, Lieutenant Cleare talked in class about his own youth and how close he came to getting into serious trouble. At one point when he was a teenager, he said, he bought a gun to try to settle a dispute and hid it in the back seat of his aunt’s car, which sat in the driveway but was never used. Then his stepfather found it. Jahkhil, 19, who is slight, with tendrils of hair framing his face, laughed. “You got snitched,” he said. “I came home,” Lieutenant Cleare said, “and I heard my mother on the phone: ‘All I know is that the bullets are the size of C batteries! ’” “If I had ended up using that,” he added, “I wouldn’t be here today. ” One day in February, another young man, skinny and tattooed, said that the class was helping him understand why the police did certain things, but that he didn’t think his views would ever fundamentally change. He said he resented the police because his father had gone to prison for eight years, starting when he was 10. “My birthday was like the day before he got locked up,” he said. “Imagine, 10 years old, birthday  —   you think you’re about to get presents, everything. ” He said he had been close to his father when he was younger, but now they did not understand each other, and he had seen him only once since he was released from prison last year. Before coming to Liberation he attended Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School, from which he should have graduated in 2015. (Asked why he fell behind, he smiled and said, “They had too many girls over there. ”) Still, he said he was confident he would graduate in June, as long as he could pass the algebra Regents exam that month. But just four days later, he was arrested along with a younger boy and charged with robbery. According to a criminal complaint, he pointed a BB gun at several young people and took two cellphones. The police arrested them on a bus, nine blocks west of the school. His first day back at Liberation, a little over two weeks later, the policing class met but Lieutenant Cleare couldn’t make it, so Ms. Leong talked to the students about a coming field trip to Baruch College. After class, she approached the young man, who hung his head and looked embarrassed. In a voice barely above a whisper, he said that he hadn’t wanted to come to school that day, but he had pushed himself. “I’m just trying to stay focused,” he said. Ms. Leong asked gently, “You want to speak to Cleare?” The young man nodded. She dialed her phone and handed it to him. He spoke quietly for several minutes, explaining his version of the story, and listened to Lieutenant Cleare, who told him it was important that he find a good lawyer and take responsibility for his actions. Ms. Leong said later that she worried the student would become discouraged and drop out. He was already 20, so he had little time left to graduate before he aged out of the public school system at 21. In March, Detective Joseph Agosto, a firearms instructor at the Police Academy, came to the class with the department’s firearms simulator. The law enforcement equivalent of a video game, it lets participants act out various policing scenarios. The instructor gives the details of a 911 call to which the police are responding. Then the scene is projected on a screen. The participants  —   usually police recruits  —   can talk to the characters and give commands. They can use pepper spray or a baton. Or they can shoot a gun or a Taser. If they hit a character in the right spot, the character will fall. Detective Agosto told the class that his responsibility was to train police officers to avoid getting shot. He said the Supreme Court had set a standard known as objective reasonableness for deciding whether an officer was justified in using force. He said it meant that an officer did not have to be right to shoot, but only to respond reasonably. Vinnette Carrasquillo, 20, was about to graduate that month, six and a half years after starting high school she had missed a year and a half while she was pregnant and after her daughter was born. She said she had heard that police officers were trained to shoot to kill and asked if that was true. “That’s a complete fallacy,” Detective Agosto said, “but that’s what people want you to hear. ” As it turned out, when the students took their turns at the simulator, they were more than ready to use lethal force. In one scenario, two students shot a mentally disturbed woman in an alley who was brandishing a pair of scissors. In another, Jahkhil and Jonathan, a classmate, responded to a call about a burglar alarm going off at a warehouse and found a man inside standing behind a table, with one of his hands hidden. Jonathan pointed his gun. They ordered the man to put his hands up. He argued with them instead. When he lifted one of his hands holding a metal object, Jahkhil and Jonathan opened fire, and the man fell. Only afterward did they see that the object was a staple gun. The class hooted, and Jahkhil burst into tense laughter. “You’re laughing, right, because what did you just do?” Detective Agosto said. “Killed him,” Jahkhil said. “You shot a guy with a staple gun,” Detective Agosto said. Why would someone do that, the students asked. “There’s a phenomenon called suicide by cop  —   it happens all the time,” Detective Agosto said. One scenario involved a shooting at a minimart, which led to a firefight with the perpetrator. In another situation, two students were told they were responding to a call about a domestic dispute. “Is there kids in the house?” asked Alisha, one of the students. She had transferred to Liberation from Lincoln in the fall, not because she was behind, she said, but because she wanted to be in a smaller school. Like Vinnette, she was about to graduate. Looking in the window of the house, Alisha, 18, and her partner, Malik, 19, saw a man with his back turned leaning over a couch, and a woman screaming in terror. When they called out, the man turned around. In his hands was a shotgun, which was pointed right at them. Malik froze, but Alisha sprang into action. She fired 10 rounds, missing once or twice, then hitting him in the elbow and the torso. She fired a couple of rounds after he fell. When she went back to her seat, her hands were shaking, and after a minute tears started streaming down her face. Ms. Leong rubbed her shoulder, and Detective Agosto asked why she was emotional. “Because that’s a common situation, personally,” she said. “You have to think of it this way,” Detective Agosto said. “You may have shot this guy. But what did I do? I also saved his wife. ” After the students ran through five scenarios, Detective Agosto’s partner, Officer Steven Malone, made an observation. Of the five scenarios, he said, only the conflict at the minimart had to end with the police firing their guns. “You shot everybody,” he said. Vinnette nodded. “Then we sit here: ‘Cops are killing everybody,’” she said. Lieutenant Cleare asked how the students who had fired their weapons felt. Alisha said she felt sympathy with officers. Bobby, who sat in the back and was unusually quiet, said, “I understood, like, why they do what they do. ” “You all human,” said Jahkhil, “just like us. ” A young woman in the policing class, who asked to be identified by only her middle name, Marie, began missing class in February. Marie, 20, was in her third year at Liberation and close to graduating, but she had recently been kicked out of her mother’s apartment and had lost custody of her    son to the city’s Administration for Children’s Services. At one point, she sent Ms. Leong a text message saying she had to leave school because she’d had little to eat in the past two days and didn’t feel well. Pointing to her own background, Ms. Leong urges students to recognize the disadvantages they face at home but not to use them as an excuse. Instead of offering Marie sympathy, Ms. Leong noted that she could have asked for food from the school’s pantry, which is stocked with pasta and other staples for students who do not have enough to eat at home. “She said, ‘I don’t want to keep asking,’” Ms. Leong said later. “I said, ‘That’s your choice. ’” Although Ms. Leong is tough on students, she is not punitive, even when they curse at her or other staff members. She said that some teachers wanted her to be more harsh. But when students are accustomed to being hurt by the people closest to them, she said, a suspension often has little impact. “They say it out loud  —   ‘So what? ’” Ms. Leong said. “‘My mother just kicked me out. Kick me out, too? Go right ahead. ’” Ms. Leong said it was usually more effective to talk with students than to suspend them. “Taking ownership and apologizing and ‘what am I going to do different’ is different for them, and I think they learn to respect that,” she said. As the year went on, Lieutenant Cleare continued to emphasize that students could change their relationship with the police by extending some basic courtesy. And he offered his own friendship. He cheered on the basketball team at its championship game in February, and in May he challenged the players to a game at the Coney Island Y. M. C. A. against him and a group of fellow officers. The students won both games. He attended graduation in June, and in August he helped Ms. Leong organize what she called a unity barbecue at the school for current students and recent graduates, their families and officers from the 60th Precinct and PSA 1. If the goal of the Junior Citizens Police Academy was to change the dynamic between the students and the police, it did not work miracles or magically erase a legacy of distrust. Many of the students remained wary of the police and still believed that many officers were racist. But they had developed, in many cases for the first time, a close relationship with a police officer, as well as some respect for the challenges of policing and the risks officers take to protect the public. Bobby and Jahkhil both became interested in law enforcement as a career, which in turn sharpened their interest in college as a necessary step on that path. Often, what Lieutenant Cleare said in class discussions mattered less than that he was there at all. Jonathan, 19, who grew up in Coney Island with Bobby and, like him, transferred to Liberation from Lincoln, said the basketball game against the officers had affected his feelings about the police more than anything in the class had. “I could tell they had love for the game, like I do,” he said. He added that even though he never confided in Lieutenant Cleare about something deeply personal, he now felt that he could. Lieutenant Cleare said the class had affected him, too. “It actually just gave me more insight to the struggle that our kids face  —   the real struggle that they have being in an urban community,” he said. Even though he works with students often, he explained, he rarely has the chance to build close relationships with them. “This class enabled me to develop those bonds, where they were comfortable enough to talk to me about issues and be real,” he said. Lieutenant Cleare said he was considering going back to work in schools as a counselor when he is eligible to retire from the department in two years. The school year ended in June. Alisha, Bobby, Marie and Vinnette graduated. Jonathan, who had finished all his credits but had not passed the global history Regents test, failed the exam in June and then again in August and is now back at Liberation, studying to retake it in January. The student who was arrested in February did not drop out, and he attended every meeting of the policing class. Ms. Leong made him one of her interns, which meant that he worked for her after school and helped host community events, and he went to summer school. She expects him to graduate in December. His court case is in preliminary and evidentiary hearings. By the time of the shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota, the students had scattered. Ms. Leong said she had spoken with some of them, and they wondered whether the officers in those encounters had received sufficient training. She said of the students’ reaction: “Their thing was, This is why more of us should think about going into law enforcement, because we need to change who is in law enforcement, so that they wouldn’t be racist or have stereotypes in their heads or be so afraid to deal with us that you’re ready to shoot us. ” She hopes that offering the class again this year will keep alive the conversations about policing and racial justice that were stirred up by recent events. Too often, she said, her students become angry but don’t think they can change anything, so they move on. “That level of empowerment or voice just seems out of their reach,” she said. Ms. Leong wants to convince her students that they have a voice. She plans to ask some of the students from the previous class to speak to a group of high school principals to encourage them to consider organizing similar programs. And in the future, she hopes to raise money to take the students to other cities to talk to young people there about what they learned. Bobby, who started taking classes last month at Borough of Manhattan Community College, said the shootings of Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile made him angry. He said he still believed that the majority of police officers, at least outside New York City, were racist. But before the class, he said, he would have condemned all police officers as a group. “There just would have been no respect,” he said. Now his perspective had shifted somewhat. “I got respect for those who have respect for me,” he said. “That’s how I feel now. ”",0
"Britain's new 3 billion pound warship has a leak LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s biggest ever warship, the new 3.1 billion pound ($4.2 billion) aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, has a leak and needs repairs, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Tuesday. The 65,000-tonne ship is hailed as Britain s most advanced military vessel and was only commissioned by the queen two weeks ago but it has a problem with a shaft seal that was identified during sea trials, the MoD said.  Sea trials are precisely for finding manageable teething problems like this and rectifying them,  a Royal Navy spokesman said.   Repairs under contract are already underway alongside in Portsmouth and the sea trials will take place as planned in the New Year, when we will continue to rigorously test the ship before she enters service.  The Sun newspaper reported that the 280-metre (920-foot) warship, the nation s future flagship vessel, was letting in 200 liters of water every hour and the fix would cost millions of pounds. A defense source said the navy was aware that the ship, which took eight years to build, had an issue when it was handed over by manufacturers and the Sun said the builders would have to foot the repair bill. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance - a consortium including British engineering companies BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Babcock (BAB.L), and the UK division of France s Thales (TCFP.PA) - built the Queen Elizabeth and its sister aircraft carrier, the HMS Prince of Wales, as apart of a 6.2 billion pound project.  It s normal practice for a volume of work and defect resolution to continue following vessel acceptance,  BAE Systems said in a statement.  This will be completed prior to the nation s flagship re-commencing her program at sea in 2018.  BAE said the issue would take just a couple of days to fix with no need for the ship to be taken into a dry dock. Chris Parry, a former senior Royal Navy officer, said all ships took on water.   That s why you have pumps,  he told Sky News.  When you get a brand new car not everything s perfect, you have to send it back to the garage to get a few things tweaked. This is exactly in that bracket.  Also on Tuesday, parliament s defense committee raised questions about the procurement of the F-35 fighter jets from a consortium led by Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) which will eventually operate from the Queen Elizabeth. The committee said there had been an  unacceptable lack of transparency  about the program and the MoD had failed to provide details of the full cost of each aircraft which one newspaper had estimated could be as much as 155 million pounds.  We strongly refute any suggestion of a lack of transparency in the F-35 program,  an MOD spokesman said.   The program remains on track, on time, within costs and not only offers our military the world s most advanced fighter jet but will support over 24,000 British jobs and is very much clear for take-off.  When the aircraft carrier was commissioned, British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said:  Our new aircraft carrier is the epitome of British design and dexterity, at the core of our efforts to build an Armed Forces fit for the future.

"Special counsel to meet Senate committee leaders  (This June 19 story has been refiled to correct Mueller title to special counsel.) By Jonathan Landay WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special counsel Robert Mueller will hold talks this week with senior Senate Judiciary Committee members to ensure that there is no conflict between his investigation of potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and the panel’s probe, two congressional aides said on Monday. Mueller, a former FBI director, will meet on Wednesday with the committee’s Republican chairman, Charles Grassley, and its top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They will be joined by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, they added. The subcommittee is examining what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Russian campaign of influence was intended to boost Donald Trump’s chances of winning the 2016 presidential election. The discussions will focus on ensuring that the subcommittee’s investigation is not interfering with Mueller’s probe, one source said. Spokesmen for the committee and for Mueller declined to comment. Mueller also was expected to meet sometime during the week with top members of the House of Representatives’ Intelligence Committee for a similar discussion.  A spokesman and a spokeswoman for the panel also declined to discuss the matter. The special counsel met last week with the Republican chairman and the top Democrat overseeing the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation of what U.S. intelligence agencies say  Russia denies that it conducted such a campaign, and Trump denies there was any collusion between his campaign and Moscow.

"Nominee for U.S. EPA chemical safety withdraws: Bloomberg  (In this Dec. 13 story, corrects third paragraph to say Dourson is a former professor at the University of Cincinnati) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former chemical industry consultant nominated by the Trump administration to head the Environmental Protection Agency’s chemical safety and pollution prevention office has withdrawn his nomination, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. Michael Dourson notified the administration of his decision on Wednesday after Republican senators raised concerns about his past work and possible conflicts of interest, said Bloomberg, which cited an unnamed official for the report. Dourson, a former professor at the University of Cincinnati who has worked as a consultant for chemical companies, was one of several people whose nominations for top EPA positions were approved by the Senate environment panel in October in a 11-10 vote along party lines. Bloomberg said several Republican senators refused to support Dourson, including Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, both of North Carolina, who raised concerns about contaminated water at the Camp Lejeune military base in their state. The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. A spokeswoman for Burr said she could not confirm that Dourson had withdrawn. Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate environment panel, said in a statement, “Dourson, an individual who has spent most of his career promoting less protective chemical safety standards, had no business overseeing our nation’s chemical safety laws.” Environmental group Earthjustice hailed the news as a “victory for all children, workers and communities who deserve the strongest protections from exposure to toxic chemicals and pesticides.” Dourson, while a consultant, had assessed some chemicals, including PFOA, used to make Teflon non-stick surfaces, to be safe at levels far higher than considered acceptable by the EPA.

"Obama Says He Will Keep More Troops in Afghanistan Than Planned - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   President Obama said Wednesday that he planned to leave 8, 400 American troops in Afghanistan until the end of his term, further slowing the drawdown in a   war that Mr. Obama pledged to end on his watch but now seems likely to grind on indefinitely. Acknowledging that the Taliban had retaken territory and were terrorizing the population, Mr. Obama said he was again adjusting his plan to withdraw American forces. The announcement will leave his successor with a substantial military commitment in the country, though far less than the nearly 40, 000 troops deployed there when he took office. “The security situation in Afghanistan remains precarious,” Mr. Obama said from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. “Even as they improve, Afghan security forces are still not as strong as they need to be. ” Those troops, he said, had not been able to quell a string of attacks and suicide bombings, including in the capital, Kabul. The United States has close to 10, 000 soldiers in Afghanistan, where they train and equip Afghan forces, and carry out counterterrorism operations. When he last tinkered with the drawdown schedule, Mr. Obama said he hoped to reduce that number to 5, 500 by early 2017. Now, more than 8, 000 troops will remain, and it will be up to Mr. Obama’s successor to order any further reductions. The president recently loosened the rules of engagement for American troops to give them the ability to fight the Taliban directly, and more flexibility to carry out airstrikes or wage ground combat. Mr. Obama cast his decision as a vote of confidence in Afghanistan’s government, led by President Ashraf Ghani, as well as in the support of NATO members and other partners, who have contributed 6, 000 troops. But it also underscores the fact that American hopes of building an Afghan force capable of securing the entire country had fallen short. “We have to deal with the realities of the world as it is,” said Mr. Obama, who was flanked by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. “It is going to continue to take time to build up military capacity that we sometimes take for granted. Given the enormous challenges they face, the Afghan people will need the partnership of the world, led by the United States, for many years to come. ” Mr. Obama announced the decision a day before leaving for a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw. Administration officials said the timing was intended to clarify American intentions and demonstrate that the United States was committed to Afghanistan. The president made the decision, which was very closely held, after a lengthy internal debate, and based on a recommendation from the American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. Keeping 8, 400 troops in the field, a senior administration official said, would allow American forces there to advise Afghan commanders “at the   and   level out in the field” over a sustained period, something that would not have been possible at lower troop levels. The number represents a slight decline from the 9, 800 troops currently deployed. “It’s an important and timely shift,” said Daniel F. Feldman, who was Mr. Obama’s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan. “I welcome it as a demonstration, not only of the administration’s flexibility in best advancing our national security interests in Afghanistan, but of the   commitment we’ve said we’ve had to Afghanistan, but which was being questioned there. ” Mr. Feldman was among more than a dozen former military commanders and diplomats who had urged Mr. Obama last month in a letter not to cut troop levels. Two prominent Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, added their voices to that call. “If we go to 5, 500, this place will fall apart quickly, quicker than Iraq,” said Mr. Graham, who joined Mr. McCain on a July 4 visit to Afghanistan. “If we keep 9, 800, there is a decent chance we can succeed. ” But Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and a critic of the war, said, “We are engaged in what appears to be an endless war, with no strategy about how to end the conflict and disengage our troops. ” Besides fragile security, the decision reflected American worries that Al Qaeda was regrouping in Afghanistan, and that the Islamic State had established a foothold there. Mr. Obama repeated his vow that he would not allow Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven for terrorists. There have been other signs that the United States is preparing for a   counterterrorism campaign. In May, a missile fired from an American drone killed Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, the head of the Taliban, as he was traveling in Pakistan’s Balochistan Province. The decision to strike him on Pakistani soil, and then to announce it publicly, suggested a new, more aggressive approach by the United States. “We can’t forget what’s at stake in Afghanistan,” Mr. Obama said. “This is where Al Qaeda is trying to regroup. This is where ISIL continues to try to expand is presence,” he said, using the administration’s preferred acronym for the Islamic State. The Afghan government had lobbied privately to keep the troops, American officials said. “We were expecting a decision based on the ground realities, and we welcome President Obama’s decision,” said Haroon Chakhansuri, a spokesman for Mr. Ghani. The government has struggled with security as American soldiers have left, steadily losing territory to Taliban insurgents. They briefly captured Kunduz last year, the first time they had seized a major urban center since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Insurgents claiming affiliation with the Islamic State have also contested districts in eastern Afghanistan, and have remained a persistent threat despite major military operations against them. Despite the assassination of Mullah Mansour, the Taliban have retained their ability to carry out attacks in cities, most recently killing at least 33 people, almost all of them police cadets, in a bombing in Kabul. The deployment, Mr. Obama noted, was a far cry from the 100, 000 combat troops once there. But he acknowledged the frustration people might feel at the inability of the United States to draw this war to a close. “When we first sent our forces into Afghanistan 14 years ago,” he said, “few Americans imagined we’d be there  —   in any capacity  —   this long. ”",0
"Southeast Congo faces 'deadly disaster', half a million people displaced: NGO ABIDJAN (Reuters) - More than half a million people have fled ethnic violence in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo since last year, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said on Wednesday, warning that the area is  on the brink of a deadly disaster .  Four years of clashes between militias representing the Luba, a Bantu ethnic group, and Twa pygmies in Tanganyika province have killed hundreds of people and forced thousands to flee into neighboring Zambia. The conflict, which appears to have intensified in recent months, is part of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Congo. Militia violence has spiked this year, fueled in part by President Joseph Kabila s refusal to step down when his constitutional mandate expired last December.   Tanganyika is on the brink of a deadly disaster,  said Ulrika Blom, NRC s Congo country director, in a statement.  It s a catastrophic cocktail about to blow up.   The United Nations declared Congo a level three humanitarian emergency last month - the highest possible classification and on par with Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Nearly 4 million Congolese are internally displaced.  NRC, an independent aid agency, said that over 80 percent of the people sheltering in displacement sites it visited over the last two weeks in Tanganyika do not have access to clean drinking water.  The conflict in Tanganyika is driven by inequalities between Bantu villagers and the Twa, a hunting and gathering people historically excluded from access to land and basic services. Some 600,000 children are also on the brink of starvation in central Congo s Kasai region, where a local insurrection has killed up to 5,000 people since August of last year, the World Food Programme s executive director said on Monday. Millions died during regional conflicts in eastern Congo between 1996-2003, most from hunger and disease.  ",0
"Despite EU caution, France pursues tough line on Iran missile program PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it wanted an  uncompromising  dialogue with Iran about its ballistic missile program and a possible negotiation over the issue separate from Tehran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Paris has already suggested that new European sanctions against Iran could be discussed over its missile tests, something EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini seemed to dismiss on Tuesday, keen not to raise risks to the hard-won deal that curbed Iran s disputed nuclear activity. On Sunday, Iran rejected a call by French President Emmanuel Macron for talks on its missiles, saying they were defensive in nature and had nothing to do with its nuclear energy work.  France is concerned about the continued pace of the Iranian missile program, which does not conform with (U.N.) Security Council Resolution 2231 and which is a source of destabilization and insecurity for the region,  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne told reporters in a daily briefing. Resolution 2231, which enshrined the nuclear deal, calls on Iran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs, including launches using such technology. It stops short of explicitly barring such activity.  France wishes to examine all the diplomatic options: a frank and uncompromising political dialogue with Iran; investigations by the U.N. General Secretariat; if necessary, new European sanctions against Iranian entities or individuals involved in the ballistic program; and finally opening a negotiation on the subject,  she said. President Donald Trump, who has resumed a confrontational U.S. approach to Iran in contrast with predecessor Barack Obama s policy of detente, has said Iranian missile activity should be curbed and wants to punish Tehran over its role in  Yemen and Syria. Trump has also dealt a blow to Iran s nuclear deal - agreed with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States under Obama - by decertifying Iranian compliance with its terms, contradicting the findings of U.N. nuclear inspectors. The U.S. Congress now has until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran that had been lifted in exchange for limiting its nuclear program in ways meant to prevent it developing an atomic bomb. But the EU, which normally coordinates closely with Washington on international sanctions, has been lobbying hard to keep the nuclear pact alive, saying it should be kept separate from missile and regional security matters. France s tougher line on the missile issue appears to reflect a concern that Iran might eventually try to arm a missile cone with a nuclear bomb, should it ever build one. Tehran has repeatedly denied any intent to do so. Romatet-Espagne reiterated the view that the nuclear deal should be kept separate, but said the ballistic missile issue was being discussed with fellow EU governments and Mogherini s foreign service. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian had been due to visit Tehran before the end of the month, although that has now been pushed back to later in the year due to a busy schedule, a diplomatic source said. Any EU-wide sanctions action requires the unanimity of all 28 member states but there is no consensus on new punitive steps against Iran, a fact made clear by Mogherini on Monday.  We didn t discuss, not today, not last week (and) I don t foresee any discussion also in the future, further sanctions from the EU side on Iran,  she said, alluding to Macron s remarks, after a meeting of EU foreign ministers.

"Rockettes Not Required to Dance at Trump Inauguration, Company Says - The New York Times Within hours of confirming plans to appear at the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, the Radio City Rockettes were plunged into a maelstrom of social media outrage on Friday amid reports that the performers were contractually obligated to dance at the ceremony or lose their jobs. But as the day wore on, both the Madison Square Garden Company, which manages the Rockettes, and the dancers’ union, the American Guild of Variety Artists, said that any of the dancers could opt out of the Jan. 20 performance in Washington. The day of statements followed reports that a Rockette was “embarrassed and disappointed” that the decision to perform had been made for her. The dancer’s private Instagram post was published by the gossip website Perez Hilton and quoted widely by news outlets. That dancer, Phoebe Pearl, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Friday, nor did several of her fellow performers. Not long after those reports, a statement relayed through Mikyl Cordova, a spokeswoman for the Madison Square Garden Company, said that dancers’ appearances are voluntary. “For a Rockette to be considered for an event, they must voluntarily sign up and are never told they have to perform at a particular event, including the inaugural,” the statement read. “It is always their choice. ” The statement also said that, among the dancers, Mr. Trump’s inauguration has been a popular opportunity: “In fact, for the coming inauguration, we had more Rockettes request to participate than we have slots available. We eagerly await the inaugural celebrations. ” Nonetheless, the company did not respond to further inquiries or make any dancers available for interviews. Despite these assurances, many of the women may feel under pressure to perform. Much of the fear and confusion could be traced to an email sent on Thursday night by the union to some of the dancers. “If you are full time, you are obligated,” said that message, which was forwarded to The New York Times. “Doing the best performance to reflect an American institution which has been here for over 90 years is your job. I hope this pulls into focus the bottom line on this work. ” Union officials did not return any calls, but on Friday evening, the guild said on Facebook that it had reached an agreement with the company that would allow all employees, even   dancers, to opt out of the inauguration. It said the earlier email to its members had simply been an explanation of the existing contract. The pressure to perform at the inauguration ceremony will probably vary based on the circumstances of each Rockette, according to a performer who spent five years with the company. Heather Lang, a contemporary dancer who left the Rockettes in 2009, said in a phone interview that there are about 12   dancers who perform in both winter and spring shows. They are a minority of the company, which has about 80 Rockettes. All of the dancers were seasonal until about a year ago. Ms. Lang, 35, said that for   and seasonal dancers, there is a fear of jeopardizing their future employment and of compromising their standing in the eyes of James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company, and his executives, if they complain or try to bow out. “One of the most annoying situations about that job is it’s corporate,” Ms. Lang said. “It’s not like a Broadway show where you feel like you have an artistic voice. You’re sort of owned by this corporation. ” So even if an appearance is considered voluntary, individual Rockettes may feel forced to perform if they are told that executives want them onstage in Washington. Ms. Lang said that performers are drawn to the company for the honor of dancing at Radio City Music Hall  —   as well as for the health benefits. Many of the women have feared standing up for themselves in the current controversy, she said. “Everybody’s in fear of losing their job. ” The idea that Rockettes could be forced to perform prompted anger on Twitter among actors, performers and other celebrities, who began widely circulating contact information for the company, the Rockettes’s producers and their union. Chris Pappas, a tour guide with Radio City Music Hall, said employees there were angry. “I can say that as a member of the tour guide staff, we have discussed it, and it has upset us,” Mr. Pappas said in a telephone interview. “It’s not saying the Rockettes are invited to perform. It’s saying that the Rockettes will perform. ” In announcing the appearance, Mr. Dolan said in a statement on Thursday that the Rockettes were “treasured American icons,” and noted that they had performed at the inaugurations of George W. Bush in 2001 and 2005. The dance company, known for pearly smiles and high kicks, is one of the most recognizable holiday institutions of the  ’s hometown, and one of the few performers to confirm an appearance so far. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which has performed at previous presidential inaugurations, confirmed its appearance on Thursday. On Friday, a petition was circulating among people who were urging the group to reconsider. Last week, Boris Epshteyn, a spokesman for Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee, confirmed in an email that the    opera singer Jackie Evancho would be performing the national anthem at the event, calling her a “true role model and inspiration for people young and old in our country and around the globe. ” Other performers, including the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and the singer Elton John, have both said in recent days that, contrary to rumors, they would not be performing. In between commenting on Twitter about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and addressing business conflicts of interest within his family, the   took time on Thursday evening to assure the nation that he did not want   celebrities attending his inauguration. “I want the PEOPLE!” Mr. Trump tweeted.",0
"Loretta Lynch becomes first African-American woman AG. Washington (CNN) Loretta Lynch was sworn in as the new U.S. attorney general on Monday, replacing Eric Holder. Lynch, the country's first African-American woman to serve in the role, had her nomination held up more than five months over politicking in the Senate.

""Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time,"" said Vice President Joe Biden at the swearing in ceremony.

The highly politicized five-month battle to choose Obama's next attorney general came to a close Thursday when the Senate finally voted 56-43 to confirm Lynch

But the delay of her nomination neared record-breaking proportions. Republicans leading the Senate refused to bring her nomination up for a vote until Democrats cut a deal on abortion language in an unrelated bill. That legislation passed Wednesday, setting up Thursday's vote and ending the latest partisan Washington standoff.

Ten Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined Democrats. Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz was the only senator not to vote.

Obama tapped Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder in November and her nomination cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in February. Still, she waited longer than the seven most recent U.S. attorneys general combined for a vote on the Senate floor, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted on first finishing work on an unrelated bill.

Loretta Lynch's father, Lorenzo A. Lynch, was in the Senate gallery watching when the historic vote took place confirming her daughter as the first African American female attorney general.

""The good guys won. That's what has happened in this country all along,"" Lorenzo Lynch told reporters. ""Even during slavery. Levi Coffin was a founder of the Underground Railroad. Even during slavery. A white man fought against slavery. So all over this land good folks have stood in the right lane, in the right path.""

A two-time U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Lynch takes on the high-profile job at time when America faces a series of challenges, from dealing with strained relations and deep distrust in some cities between the police and the communities they serve, to criminal justice reform, to confronting the ongoing threat of terrorism.

Lynch, 55, has earned a reputation as a highly qualified, but low-profile prosecutor who has a good relationship with law enforcement and a history of handling tough cases well.

She is a good listener and a skilled consensus builder, qualities that will help her succeed at Justice, said Tim Heaphy, a former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia who served under Lynch on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, a group that meets regularly to advise the Justice department on policy matters.

""In that [attorney general] job you are at the center of so many of the emerging, significant, pressing issues not only in this country but around the world. There's probably no job in government as diverse and challenging as being attorney general of the United States,"" Heaphy said. He added that building support for initiatives both within and outside the department is an important part of the job.

""She will be good at getting people to work well together. I think that's a strength of hers. I saw that on the committee,"" Heaphy said.

Lynch's portfolio will include addressing voting rights, white-collar crime and policy reviews, as well as public corruption, an area in which she has vast experience.

In a statement, Obama said America will be better off with Lynch leading the Department of Jusice.

""Loretta's confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law,"" Obama said in a statement shortly after the vote.

Lynch's experience on civil rights case, like helping win the convictions of New York City police officers who sexually assaulted Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, will be important as her office tackles closely watched investigations in recent police conduct cases, including the still unexplained death of a 25-year-old Baltimore man while in police custody.

""She's seen and understands the injustices that have taken place in the past and so therefore she's uniquely also equipped to deal with what's going on and do the kinds of investigations that will restore faith to Americans in their justice system,"" said Rep. Greg Meeks, D-New York.

Born in Greensboro, North Carolina, Lynch grew up 60 miles to the east in Durham, North Carolina. Her father was a fourth-generation Baptist minister; her mother, an English teacher and school librarian. As a child, Lynch rode on her father's shoulders to his church, which served a meeting place for students organizing anti-segregation boycotts in the early 1960s, she told the Judiciary panel at her January confirmation hearing. Lynch eventually graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School.

Speaking at her nomination announcement in November, Lynch highlighted the fact that the Justice Department is named for an ideal.

""This is actually appropriate, because our work is both aspirational, and grounded in gritty reality,"" she said. ""Today, I stand before you so thrilled, and, frankly, so humbled to have the opportunity to lead this group of wonderful people who work all day and well into the night to make that ideal a manifest reality.""

At a conference meeting with all the nation's U.S. attorneys a few years ago, Heaphy was put in charge of organizing a presentation showing the attorneys as they were 20 years before. Lynch shared a picture of herself with her college cheerleading squad.

""Loretta sent me a picture of her as a Harvard cheerleader in a pyramid,"" he said. ""She was comfortable sharing this with Eric Holder and other department leaders. She laughed at herself.""

""I don't think she's just tough, there's a humanity, there's a human touch that she has that will also serve her well,"" he said. ""Nobody is going to mistake that she's in charge, but her humility and sense of humor will come through.""",0
"University of California IT Workers Sue After Losing Jobs To Outsourcing - Breitbart IT workers at the University of California intend to file a lawsuit challenging their dismissal after they were replaced by offshore workers, arguing that those sacked from the UC San Francisco campus were discriminated against based on age and national origin. [Around 80 people lost their positions in the department, including 50   workers and 30 contractors, in a move that is unheard of in the public sector, where offsourcing is much less common than in the private sector. UCSF hired the   firm HCL to handle its services instead of the American workers.  Randall Strauss from Gwilliam Ivary Chiosso Cavalli  Brewer, the attorney representing the   argued that “to take a workforce that is overwhelmingly over the age of 40 and replace them with folks who are mainly in their 20s  —   early 20s, in fact  —   we think is age discrimination. ” The group also represents and “reflects the diversity of California”  —   to allow them to be “replaced with people who come from one particular part of the world” is discrimination based on their national origin, continued Strauss. The lawsuit will be filed in Alameda County Superior Court. On Wednesday, details about UCSF’s financial situation emerged that may help the IT workers in their case. A report by a California state auditor found an undisclosed $175 million in funds in the university’s budget the outsourcing would be estimated to save $10 million a year for the next 5 years. The lead counsel on the case, J. Gary Gwilliam, released a statement on the subject of the university funding: It is unbelievable to me that a public university would ship good American jobs overseas by telling the fired workers, the Regents, the Legislature and public of a crying need to save money, while at the same time maintaining a secret slush fund of $175 million dollars which would more than cover the cost of keeping all these jobs in California, leaving more than enough money leftover to cover the needs of the University and its students. Similar lawsuits have been popping up around the country recently. In December, former IT workers at Disney filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming that American workers were being discriminated against in favor of hiring   visa workers from overseas. Some staff members even alleged that they were forced to train their foreign replacements before being allowed to take their redundancy check.

"Convoy rolls into Damascus suburbs with aid for 40,000: U.N. GENEVA (Reuters) - A convoy from the United Nations and Syrian Arab Red Crescent entered towns in the besieged Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta on Monday, bringing aid to 40,000 people for the first time since June 2016, the United Nations said. A tightening siege by government forces has pushed people to the verge of famine in the eastern suburbs, residents and aid workers said last week, bringing desperation to the only major rebel enclave near the Syrian capital. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Twitter they had entered the towns of Kafra Batna and Saqba. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent said in a separate tweet that the inter-agency convoy had 49 trucks.  They carried food, nutrition and health items for 40,000 people in need, OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said.  The last time we reached these two locations were in June 2016,  he said. A health worker in Saqba who was present when the convoy started to offload said that nine trucks of foodstuffs, including milk and peanut butter, and four trucks of medicines had arrived so far.  Technical specialists were on board to assess needs in the towns in order to plan a further humanitarian response, he said.  More aid to complement today s delivery is planned in the coming days,  Laerke added. At least 1,200 children in eastern Ghouta suffer from malnutrition, with 1,500 others at risk, a spokeswoman for the U.N. children s agency UNICEF said last week. Bettina Luescher, spokeswoman of the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP), said the convoy carried nutrition supplies for 16,000 children. Food, fuel and medicine once travelled across frontlines into the suburbs through a network of underground tunnels. But early this year, an army offensive nearby cut smuggling routes that provided a lifeline for around 300,000 people in the enclave east of the capital. ",0

"Uber Hires NASA Engineer for VTOL ’Flying Car’ Project - Breitbart Uber has hired NASA engineer Mark Moore as Director of Engineering for their flying car project “Uber Elevate,” which seeks to expand the cab service into airborne travel. [Moore worked at NASA “as an advanced aircraft engineer and basically kickstarted the current interest in vertical   and landing craft for   urban flight with a 2010 paper on the feasibility of the   vehicles. ”  “The engineer was impressed by Uber’s work on the subject, and saw a chance to make the vision he’d originally articulated years ago into something real, in a reasonable time scale,” according to TechCrunch. “Moore said that key to his decision to join Uber was that the company seemed to have a practical business case for making a flying commuter transit service real  —   and nothing would ever get done without market motivation behind the vision. ” Uber’s plans for a flying service were first hinted at in September 2016 by Uber’s Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden. In an interview, Holden shared his interest in “vertical takeoff and landing” vehicles (VTOL) claiming, “It could change cities and how we work and live. ” Holden added that he wanted to offer his customers “as many options as possible to move around,” and that passenger drone technology could be a fully functioning norm within a decade. “VTOL is another way to do that,” said Holden, after talking about ways to decrease city traffic. Uber’s Head of Product for Advanced Programs, Nikhil Goel, confirmed in a statement that Moore would be working on VTOL vehicles. “Uber continues to see its role as an catalyst to the growing developing VTOL ecosystem,” said Goel in the statement. “We’re excited to have Mark join us to work with companies and stakeholders as we continue to explore the use case described in our white paper. ” In 2015, rapper   and other   individuals, including members of the Saudi Arabian royal family, invested $20 million in JetSmarter, which has been billed as “the Uber for flying,” while an Israeli tech firm is also prepared to launch their   drone service in 2020, following 15 years of development.

"High School Forced to Change Mascot over Accusation ’Stallions’ Is ’Sexist’ - Breitbart A school district in Kentucky has canceled the school’s “Stallions” mascot after a petition from the community argued that the mascot was “inappropriate and sexist. ”[The petition, which garnered just over 200 signatures, was successful in its efforts to have the Fayette County school district changed the new Frederick Douglass High School’s mascot from the “Stallions” to something more appropriate for female sports teams.  This is inappropriate and sexist when you consider the definition from “YourDictionary”   …    ”The definition of a stallion is a male horse that has not been castrated, used for breeding or is slang for a powerful and virile man who has a lot of lovers” and from Wikipedia  …    ”because of their instincts as herd animals, they may be prone to aggressive behavior, particularly toward other stallions, and thus require careful management by knowledgeable handlers. However, with proper training and management, stallions are effective equine athletes at the highest levels of many disciplines. ” Superintendent Manny Caulk announced on Tuesday that the high school would get rid of the stallion mascot in favor of a more   horse mascot, which he believes will be more appropriate as a symbol for the several female sports teams that Frederick Douglass High School will field. Despite the seemingly harmless nature of the mascot, Caulk felt it necessary to claim that the never intended to offend any members of their community with the choice: “Since the public announcement of the mascot Monday, we have received feedback from some community members who have concerns about the mascot and we want assure our constituents that there was absolutely no intent to offend or upset anyone. We also recognize that there is support from others in our community to honor the former stallions of Hamburg Place farm,” Caulk said. Caulk declared that the students of Frederick Douglass High School will have the opportunity to choose their mascot from a slate of   options: “Moving forward, we will keep the Keeneland green and orange colors and horse image in the school logo to pay homage to Lexington’s rich history in the horse industry, but we will allow the incoming students of Frederick Douglass High School to choose their mascot,” Superintendent Caulk said in a statement late Tuesday. “We’ve already received suggestions of Thoroughbreds or Racers as possible alternatives to Stallions and we will solicit additional ideas from our students before they choose a   mascot grounded in the land’s equestrian heritage. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about social justice and libertarian issues for Breitbart News.

"U.S. citizen on the run after busting out of Bali prison DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian police are hunting for a U.S. citizen who escaped on Monday from an overcrowded prison on the holiday island of Bali by cutting through steel bars in a ceiling, the jail s second breakout of foreign inmates this year.  The Kerobokan prison, about 10 km (six miles) from the main tourist beaches in the Kuta area, often holds foreigners facing drug-related charges. Cristian Beasley, who was a suspect in crimes related to narcotics but had not been sentenced, escaped at 4.10 a.m. (2010 GMT Sunday), said Badung Police chief Yudith Satria Hananta.  It is thought that the prisoner escaped ... by cutting through the steel bars above the ceiling,  he said in a statement, without giving details of how Beasley escaped without being detected. Beasley, 32, from California, is believed to have then used a rope to climb down a wall before getting over a perimeter wall in an area being refurbished. Police had questioned witnesses and guards and were hunting for Beasley, Hananta said. Another American, Paul Anthony Hoffman, 57, was captured while also trying to escape, Hananta said. Representatives of Beasley and Hoffman could not immediately be reached for comment. In June, an Australian, a Bulgarian, an Indian and a Malaysian tunneled to freedom about 12 meters (13 yards) under the prison s walls. The Indian and the Bulgarian were caught soon after in neighboring East Timor, but Australian Shaun Edward Davidson and Malaysian Tee Kok King remain at large. Davidson has taunted authorities by saying he was enjoying life in various parts of the world, in purported posts on Facebook.  Kerobokan has housed a number of well-known foreign drug convicts, including Australian Schappelle Corby, whose 12-1/2-year sentence for marijuana smuggling got huge media attention. Indonesia has executed several foreign drug convicts in recent years. Indonesian prisons are often overcrowded, partly because a war on drugs led by the government of President Joko Widodo has led to a surge in the number of people locked up. As of June, Kerobokan housed 1,378 inmates, more than four times its planned capacity of 323, government data show. Prison escapes are fairly common in Indonesia, which launched an investigation this year after about 350 inmates broke out of a prison on the island of Sumatra. ",0
"Jonah Hill Is No Joke - The New York Times You can tell a lot about a person by watching him lose. I did not suggest   specifically because I thought Jonah Hill would lose at it, but rather because his initial suggestion for an interview activity  —   tennis  —   presented logistical complications: specifically, the problem of trying to talk with someone from 70 feet away across a net on a loud city court. So Hill agreed to  . “Doesn’t Susan Sarandon have a   place in New York?” he mused while forming a plan. “I’ve heard that. I know people who’ve gone there. I don’t really know what Susan Sarandon’s involvement is. I just know for certain that she’s tangentially connected to the   industry. ” This turns out to be correct. The Academy   actress Susan Sarandon is a founder of a chain of   lounges called SPiN. It has locations in New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco. The New York outlet, where I met Hill on a Wednesday afternoon in June, is an icily   subterranean space on 23rd Street with nightmarish wall murals and 18 royal blue tables. Players were scattered about the place, ponging away to a dance remix of “Let’s Talk About Sex. ” Hill arrived punctually with drowsy eyes and an iced coffee from Starbucks. “No sign of Susan Sarandon,” he observed, looking around the room and dragging on his coffee, “which is the biggest sign of Susan Sarandon. ” He did not, he said, get a lot of sleep last night. There was a work call with someone in a different time zone  —   a “finance person” for a movie he plans to direct  —   and the conversation left Hill so jazzed that he couldn’t fall asleep, so he took his French bulldog Carmela (named after Tony Soprano’s wife) for a walk around the neighborhood, and when he finally dozed off he left a window open, leaving him speckled with “a thousand” mosquito bites, visible in rosy constellations across his arms. The coffee was helping. Hill, at 32, has appeared in enough movies (currently 29) that he was recognized, in the space of 10 minutes, by a female SPiN employee in her 20s who requested a photo, by a 40ish camp counselor who asked that Hill take a picture with his campers and by the campers themselves, who clustered around the actor and stared stoically into the camera for a photo in which Hill was the only one smiling. These people probably knew Hill from his role as a hilarious sidekick in the “21 Jump Street” remakes, or from his role as a hilarious sidekick in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” or from his role as a hilarious sidekick in “Superbad. ” The   roles make up a numer ically small but   portion of Hill’s career, and no number of contrasting performances  —   in indie comedies directed by the Duplass brothers, in   dramas like “Moneyball”  —   can seem to override the public impression of him as a man who might, at any moment, start humping the furniture. This is fair, because Hill is excellent at delivering coitus jokes. It’s also unfair, because his acting career didn’t begin in a   place and it doesn’t seem to be heading in that direction, even if his IMDb page is dotted with the presence of Judd Apatow. Hill has received two Oscar nominations and produced six movies and has writing credits on both of the “Jump Street” movies. He is not Seth Rogen, although people sometimes confuse the two men, which feels vaguely   given that they look nothing alike. Next year he’ll direct a movie that he wrote (not a comedy). This summer he appears in “War Dogs,” directed by Todd Phillips, of the “Hangover” movies. Though it’s strewn with giggly moments, the movie is ultimately alarming. Hill plays a sociopathic arms dealer. In the basement at SPiN,   patrons continued to recognize the actor, who didn’t wear a hat or sunglasses or other protective camouflage, until a manager registered the ogling and transferred Hill to a private room behind a   curtain. By now the coffee had kicked in. I asked Hill if he was ready to play  . “Yeah!” he said. “I was just thinking that I’d love to. ” Pause. “You didn’t think of that idea  —   I thought of it. ” This last sentence came across as a joke in real life  —   he was doing an impression of a surreally bratty person  —   but it reads horribly on the page, which turns out to be true of many things that Hill says. His humor is  . This may be one reason that profiles of the actor have not historically been ultraflattering. Another reason may be Hill’s face. “I have resting bitch face,” he explained to me once. “I really do. It’s heartbreaking. I don’t mean anything by it. ” This is borne out by paparazzi photos of Hill sternly alighting from a vehicle, angrily riding a Citi Bike and resentfully hanging out with Leonardo DiCaprio. “I know I look really pissed off,” he said, “but I’m not. ” If life were a reality TV show, it would be accurate to say that Hill has received a “bad edit,” in part because of the above factors. In 2013 he did an interview with Rolling Stone that resulted in the following words being used by media outlets to describe him: humorless, insufferable, angry, defensive, pompous jerk, and “20 Most Hated Celebrities!” Today’s Jonah Hill, rallying at a   table, seems like someone who might do yoga, or drink green tea, or practice Transcendental Meditation. Maybe it is just the residue of his youth in California. Maybe “centeredness” is just Los Angeles leaving the body. Whatever it is, he comes off as mellow and polite, keeping his phone out of sight during interactions and asking if I have any dietary restrictions. He behaves in a way that would assure his mother that she did a good job. He says that the trait he values most in others is being nice. Most famous people have a thin oleaginous layer of social grace that tops a bottomless well of impatience to get their press duties over with, but Hill seemed to be in no particular hurry to do anything, except lose at  . While his serve is 90 percent unreturnable and his backhand is evil, Hill’s forehand is unreliable. Midway through Round 1 an employee popped his head in and asked for the score. “Fourteen to 20,” Hill replied. “She’s winning. ” The guy scoffed. “You’re losing to a girl?” “That’s not a very feminist attitude, my friend,” Hill said. “Does that make you mad?” he asked, after the employee left. “It’s not the dumb outlook that bothers me. It’s that he expects me to share that sentiment. He expects me to be like, ‘Yeah, I’m really embarrassed that a girl is beating me. ’’u2009” For Round 2, which he also lost, Hill plugged his iPod into a speaker and selected a playlist of   ’90s rap acts like the Coup and Jeru the Damaja. When the game ended, he briefly howled in grief, bounced over to shake hands and then floated the idea of barbecue for lunch. Not a bad loser. A certain comfort with vulnerability might be the most prominent aspect of Hill’s personality. At lunch, he gets the hiccups. He warns me that his face sweats a lot, but that the rest of his body produces a normal amount of sweat, and he occasionally mops his forehead as politely as anyone can mop anything using a napkin that he has folded into a tidy mopping rectangle. If you compliment his acting, he’ll say, “Thank you,” and then “Do you really feel that way?”  —   and not in a “Do go on” tone, but as if he suspects a polite fabrication and is offering an out. Once he was asked to audition for a part in a filmed musical adaptation, and he declined  —   because he can’t sing, but also because the   possibility of his audition tape’s being leaked was too embarrassing to contemplate. This hypothetical struck him as even more embarrassing than a leaked sex tape, because after all, he said, “most human beings have had more practice at having sex than they have at singing. ” Vulnerability is a counterproductive trait for a famous person to have, but Hill is funniest   when he plays characters thumping up against their feeble natures, and he is most affecting in dramatic roles doing the same. It makes you wonder whether the kind of person most suited to being an actor  —   sensitive, expressive, slightly weird  —   is the kind of person least suited to being a celebrity. Hill has been sensitive and weird since infancy. He grew up in Los Angeles, the son of an accountant and a costume designer, enjoying a childhood that he characterizes as “fun” yet “super emo. ” He cried frequently. For a year starting at age 4 he pretended to be a dog and padded around the house on all fours, woofing, which may have been his first acting experience. He intended to grow up into a writer until he became obsessed with skateboarding at around 10. His dreams of becoming a professional skater eventually receded because of a lack of skill, and he enrolled in college at The New School with plans to write and direct. “In school I was always a decent athlete, a decent student, but I was never exceptional at any of that stuff,” he says. “When I started taking acting classes, it was the first time teachers were like, ‘You’re good and you should keep doing this. ’’u2009” Another adult who recognized Hill’s potential was Dustin Hoffman, who happened to be the father of Hill’s former schoolmate Jake Hoffman and who suggested that Hill audition for “I Heart Huckabees. ” Hill got the part and appears halfway through the movie as a   teenager arguing with his sister and playing video games at a family dinner across from Mark Wahlberg. The role is a blip, but Hill earns his few minutes   appearing at ease despite never having been in a movie and having no idea, he told me, when the camera was on him. This confidence apparently stretches back to his youth: A Jewish Journal profile from 2012  —   a rare flattering one  —   includes a quote from Cantor Yonah Kliger of Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills, where Hill had his bar mitzvah, describing him as “destined for something great” and “electric” even at 13, reciting his Torah portion in a prayer shawl. Three years after “Huckabees,” Hill   in “Superbad” as a   who cries, dances, lies, has his heart broken, is struck by a number of vehicles and exchanges tender    with Michael Cera’s character in a final scene that still makes me weep in a way that no Pixar movie ever will. This was his breakthrough. If “Superbad” cemented Hill’s status as an entertaining accent piece, “Moneyball” (2011) suggested that pegging him as a novelty actor was an error. His character in that movie, an economics geek named Peter Brand, is an introvert who walks the earth as if he’s about to be pantsed. He underplays the part so deftly that Brand’s emotional climax  —   when he sees that his methods actually work  —   is conveyed by no more than a few euphoric seconds of rapid blinking and a  . The next movie he appeared in was a critical disaster of a comedy called “The Sitter. ” Because of this seesawing, the best way to make sense of Hill’s career is to divide it roughly in half, not chronologically but by the two kinds of movies he makes: on one side, the goofy com edies, and on the other side,   movies by respected directors, like “Django Unchained” and “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Hail, Caesar!” After “Superbad,” it would have been easy for Hill to take the Adam Sandler route and ride the wave of his own typecasting, making bad copies of the same movie over and over again. Instead, he exercised discretion in his roles and did a   job to hammer out the kind of career that hilarious sidekicks in   teen com edies have not traditionally enjoyed. (Jason Biggs offers a useful point of comparison it took him a decade and a half to recover from the abasement of “American Pie. ”) The parallel movie tracks have one thing in common, which is that Hill tends to play obsessive characters in both. In “War Dogs” he is obsessed with selling weapons to the United States government for piles of money. In “True Story,” he is obsessed with a murderer. In “Moneyball,” he is obsessed with sabermetrics. In “Cyrus,” he’s obsessed with his mom. In “Superbad,” he is obsessed with the probability of losing his best friend. Even in “Hail, Caesar!” though he is onscreen for approximately two seconds, the gag of Hill’s character is that he is too engrossed in processing legal papers to take note of Scarlett Johansson’s predatory innuendoes. Obsessiveness is a good filter for choosing roles, because there is nothing with more comic potential than a character who desperately wants something, and there’s also nothing with more tragic potential the distinction is in how that obsession pans out. It can be a poignant trait, as with Jay Gatsby or an evil one, as with Hannibal Lecter or a creepy one, as with Annie Wilkes or a mesmerizing one, as with Willy Wonka or an epic one, as with Charles Foster Kane or a pa thetic one, as with Norma Desmond. Monomania is infinitely versatile. Ellen Lewis, who cast Hill as Donnie Azoff in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” had been particularly impressed with his performance in “Superbad. ” “Wolf” wasn’t necessarily written to be funny, she said, but Martin Scorsese wanted a Donnie who could improvise. “Obviously it was a different way to go,” she said. “Jonah’s got depth, but at the same time, he’s extremely charismatic. And really funny people can be very dangerous. He showed that edge. ” He reminded her a little, Lewis said, of Robin Williams. One thing I’ve never understood about acting is how famous actors get better at it. Do they all have acting coaches on retainer? And if these acting coaches are so good, why aren’t they famous actors? When someone is freakishly precocious at acting, like Claire Danes, where does that come from? When someone gets appreciably worse at acting, like Al Pacino or Robert De Niro, how does that happen? And when someone gets perceptibly better at acting, like Jonah Hill, how does he make sure that his trajectory continues in a northeastern direction? At lunch he mentioned that every night before filming “Cyrus,” he brushed his lips with a toothbrush because his character seemed like the kind of person who would have permanently chapped lips. How did he learn to think of this stuff, these novelistic details? Hill shrugged at the question. “If it was your job to think of those things, you would. You just would. ” But what’s his secret? “The acting juice I drink every morning. ” But really. “I watch things over and over again,” Hill said. Like, 20 times. Most recently, “Behind the Candelabra. ” Before that, the French film “A Prophet. ” All the great Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola movies, obviously. All the Paul Thomas Anderson movies. He loves Lena Dunham and Spike Jonze. When he finds a movie he likes, he watches it compulsively  —   and at a loud volume, because he has bad hearing from listening to live music as a youth without taking the proper precautions. He watches movies until he is able to forget that he is watching a movie, which to Hill is the sign of a really great movie. He picks the roles he plays using the same rubric he uses to pick the movies that he watches, which is by director. “If you have a great script, it’s hard to [expletive] it up  —   but I’ve kind of had that happen,” he said. “And I’ve had scripts that were not even complete, and the director was amazing, and I ended up being proud of the movie. ” Great directors, he maintained, make great movies. It took him a while to figure this out. Even if a role is good, he won’t do a movie now unless he believes in the director, because “You don’t want to be a cool character in a bad movie. ” Nobody has bulletproof judgment, though, and Hill’s character in this summer’s “War Dogs” could be seen as a terrific character in an otherwise O. K. movie. It’s not that “War Dogs” isn’t funny and it’s not as if Todd Phillips has made a   comedy about Ferguson, but it is an Iraq War movie made by the director of “The Hangover. ” There are strippers and an underwritten   role and Bradley Cooper. Phillips originally approached Hill with the movie a few years ago, offering him either of the two lead roles, but Hill declined, thinking it was somehow too similar to “The Wolf of Wall Street. ” Phillips kept trying. Hill appreciated the persistence and eventually said yes. He was driving out of the “yes” meeting in his car when he spotted Phillips leaving separately on his Vespa. Unaware that Hill was watching, Phillips pulled over to the side of the road and did a victory fist pump, by himself, in a moment of unguarded personal joy. Hill found this immensely endearing. (Philips said he does not recall this event but that he believes it happened: “I’ve been known to tool around on my Vespa and I’ve been known to get excited. ”) “It’s funny,” Phillips said of Hill, “because in actual life he’s  —   ‘quiet’ is the wrong word, but reserved. If you sit down to lunch with him you’ll laugh, but he’s reserved. When he steps on set, this natural swagger comes out. ” In the movie, Hill plays Efraim Diveroli, an   bro from Miami Beach with   ambitions and a buttery spray tan. The movie is based on a true story, which originally appeared in Rolling Stone and which Hill himself tried to option before finding out that Phillips had already bought the rights. The real Efraim Diveroli does not approve of the movie, has not spent time with Hill and has filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. The buttery spray tan was applied nightly in Hill’s hotel room by a woman named Felicia, who stood aiming a hose while he pulled his boxers into a thong and revolved. Throughout filming he smelled faintly tropical. To prepare for all his movies, Hill compiles   playlists and then listens to them until they seep into his consciousness. For “War Dogs,” the playlist involved “a lot of cheesy,   Miami booty bass,” which gives you a sense of his character’s personality: loud, libidinous and whatever the opposite of introspective is. “I imagined him listening to music that revved him up to lie to someone,” Hill said. “A lot of the people with confidence that you play, you try to find their deep insecurity. I don’t think Efraim is a deeply, deeply insecure person. ” Instead of making the character a cartoon villain, Hill’s Efraim is gleeful and coercive and menacing, with a helmet of gelled hair and a   giggle that sounds like the creepiest ringtone on earth. Miles Teller   in the film but disappears in the role next to Hill, he has the charisma of a corn dog. Hill’s appeal, whatever the genre, is in his instinct to punctuate long stretches of smoothness with florid bloopers. He’s either fully in control of himself or totally at the mercy of his emotions. He has the fallibility of an Everyman with the magnetism of someone millions of young men and women would halt a   game to take a selfie with. A decade ago we idolized celebrities whom we could never, in a million years, imagine being or dating. Lately we have adjusted our expectations downward to prefer figures, like Hill, who could be described as “reasonably aspirational. ” In person he’s both smooth and   not with cinematic extremity but in a way that makes you think his friends definitely have a lot of Jonah Hill anecdotes in their back pockets. He is a generator of incidents. One morning in June we went for a southbound walk on the High Line. Hill ambled along at a      pace, pausing to buy a $1 amulet reading WORK SMOOTHLY LIFETIME PEACE from a (possibly phony) monk and lingering to form a   audience for a street performer singing Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up. ” “I love this song,” Hill said, grooving mildly and retrieving a bill from his pocket. There was no visible donation receptacle, so he put the money on the performer’s side table, where it started blowing away in the wind. To prevent this, Hill slid the man’s nearby iPhone onto the bill to act as a paperweight, but his finger tapped “pause” in the process and the Rick Astley instrumental abruptly ceased. “I’m sorry!” Hill wailed. “I completely [expletive] that up. ” The performer made a “no prob” gesture and resumed singing, then did a back flip, as if to assure Hill that everything was cool between them. As we walked away Hill spoke directly into my tape recorder, as if to guarantee that the corny Rick Astley joke he was about to make would be reflected accurately for future generations: “I want it on the record that he just looked me in the eye and promised me never to hurt me. It’s documented. If that man ever, ever breaks my heart or deserts me, there will be legal repercussions. ”",0
"In schools and hospitals, Turkey carves north Syria role AL-BAB, Syria/BEIRUT/ANKARA (Reuters) - Children returning to school in the northern Syrian city of al-Bab were handed a new textbook this term:  T rk e  reniyorum  -  I am learning Turkish . Turkish lessons, Turkish signposts, Turkish-trained police and most recently a Turkish post office all point to Turkey s deepening role in an area of northern Syria it captured from Islamic State (IS) with the help of Syrian rebels. Turkish administrators are even helping to run hospitals in the area.  Ankara has taken on a widening role in the 100-km (60-mile) stretch of territory seized in its eight-month long  Euphrates Shield  operation, laying the foundations for long-term ties with an area that is of crucial strategic importance to Turkey. Launched to drive IS away from the border, the operation also aimed to block further expansion by Syrian Kurdish groups that Ankara deems a threat to its national security. With the Euphrates Shield region calm for months, Ankara says it wants to help recovery and to encourage a return of Syrian refugees, millions of whom fled the six-year-long war into Turkey. But Turkish support is also consolidating the region s status as a Syrian opposition-held territory where Turkey-backed Syrian opposition groups are building their own government even as the forces of President Bashar al-Assad win back swathes of the country elsewhere.  After Daesh (Islamic State) was expelled ... we returned and the cities were suffering from large-scale destruction and general ruin,  said Mohammad Karaz, director of education in al-Bab.  Some schools were wiped out entirely,  he said.  The restoration was done by our Turkish brothers who restored 10 schools, one of which we are sitting in today,  he said during an interview at the Major Bulent al-Bayrak elementary school, named after a Turkish officer killed while fighting Islamic State for control of al-Bab.  Arabs and Turks are siblings  reads a mural in the schoolyard. Turkish aid includes stationery, books and clothes. Karaz said the schools were teaching a Syrian curriculum modified to remove the state s Baathist ideology. The decision to add Turkish was taken unanimously by Syrian education officials in the area, he said. Turkish classes, taught by Syrians trained in Turkey, have started for pupils aged between six and nine. Explaining the decision, Karaz noted that two-thirds of al-Bab citizens had sought refuge in Turkey. Turkish authorities had given assurances that qualifications from schools in the area would  be recognized in Turkey and students can apply to Turkish universities , he said. A senior Turkish official said Ankara aimed to recreate  the conditions to bring life back to normal  in the area which is located northeast of the city of Aleppo and stretches to the western bank of the Euphrates River. Turkish support included health care, security, food and police training.   Turkey wants the Syrians living (in Turkey) to return to their country ... However, it will continue to host the Syrians here and provide humane living conditions for the Syrians in the regions under its control for as long as necessary,  the official told Reuters. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, in a speech last weekend, said:  We don t have a wish to occupy these lands but we want the rightful owners to go back there.  Damascus has, however, long accused Turkey, a major backer of the Syrian opposition to Assad, of colonial ambitions in northern Syria. The front page of the pro-Damascus Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar on Thursday declared that Ankara was undertaking the  Turkification  of the area. Turkey s intervention was driven chiefly by concern over the growing sway of Syrian Kurdish groups seen by Ankara as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade long insurgency against the Turkish state. The Euphrates Shield operation shattered the Syrian Kurds  hopes of joining up two Kurdish-dominated regions of northern Syria, where the war has allowed Kurdish militia to carve out their own autonomous regions. The Syrian opposition s efforts to establish their own  interim government  in the Euphrates Shield area received a big boost this week when a Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel group handed it control of a border crossing to Turkey. The interim government s aims include drawing investment to move  the people from a state of war to work and building the region , said Khaled Aaba, a senior official with the Jabha Shamiya FSA group that handed over Bab al-Salama crossing. Crediting Turkey for standing by  Syrians in their travails , he said Ankara was  actively participating in supporting administrative and service institutions in the area .  The existence of (the interim) government better organizes this relationship.  Turkey s support to the health sector has included repairing and expanding hospitals previously operated by the Syrian state. Turkish administrators are working alongside Syrians at the Hikmeh Hospital in al-Bab, said Ahmad Aabo, a Syrian medical official in the city. Turkey s main project is a 200-bed hospital that will replace one destroyed during the war with IS.  The companies taking control of the construction are Turkish, we don t have companies capable of doing such a project,  said Aabo, speaking to Reuters in a telephone interview from the city. He said work on the hospital, which began a month ago, should be completed by New Year, comparing the rapid pace of the Turkish project with the 25 years it had taken to build its predecessor.     Turkish support for Syrian security forces has included training police officers who began deploying in the region in January. Abdel Razzak al-Laz, the head of the  National Police and General Security Forces , said 7,000 have now been deployed.      Everyone wants the return of security and stability, wants to see a police patrol at night and during the day,  said Laz, a police director when he defected to the opposition in 2012.  The numbers are increasing, and there are continuous courses.       ",0
"Russian hopes of thaw with Trump dented after his top security adviser quits MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s parliament applauded on learning that Donald Trump had won the U.S. election. But prospects for better relations with Washington have suffered setbacks since then and the resignation of Trump’s national security adviser is the biggest blow yet. The Kremlin still believes a rapprochement is feasible, even if it might take longer than initially thought. But the clock is ticking: Vladimir Putin is expected to run for another presidential term next year, and an easing in Western sanctions could speed Russia’s recovery from a recession and safeguard his national popularity. For now, Russia plans to keep working with the Trump administration towards a rapprochement, looking to improve the atmosphere. With relations having sunk to a post-Cold War nadir under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama as a result of Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, they could hardly get worse. A first meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, expected in Germany later this week, will give the Kremlin a chance to grasp what Washington is now thinking and where this may lead. The resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was seen in Moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with Russia, has underscored for the Kremlin the difficulties of reaching a settlement with Washington and drove home the urgent need to find new areas of common interest.  Flynn, who shared dinner with Putin in 2015 and favoured Washington uniting with Russia against Islamic State militants, quit on Monday after revelations he had improperly discussed the issue of U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Trump took office. A U.S. official said Flynn indicated to the envoy that the sanctions “would not necessarily carry over to an administration seeking to improve relations between the U.S. and Russia”.  “Flynn, unlike many other high-ranking Americans, was at least open to dialogue,” said Konstantin Kosachev, head of the upper house of parliament’s foreign affairs committee. “Either Trump has not gained the requisite independence and  is being gradually (and not unsuccessfully) backed into a corner, or Russophobia has already infected the new administration.” Other Russian politicians suggested Flynn had been forced to resign to harm relations with Moscow. But the Kremlin, anxious not to feed fears of Russian media manipulation to influence U.S. politics, said only that it was an internal U.S. matter.  Trump came to power talking of wanting cooperative U.S.-Russian relations, for example to take joint action against Islamic State militants. So far, there’s been scant improvement.  Trump spoke by phone to Putin on Jan. 28, but Reuters learnt that the call had not gone smoothly: Trump used it to denounce a treaty that caps U.S. and Russian deployment of nuclear warheads as a bad deal for the United States. The Kremlin is also struggling to set up a meeting. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, said on Tuesday he could not say when or where the Russian leader would meet Trump and that it was “premature” to even talk about what direction U.S.-Russian relations might take. A series of U.S. Senate confirmation hearings for Trump’s cabinet nominees did not go the Kremlin’s way either, with the incoming defense secretary and secretary of state both raising concerns about the dangers of Russia as an unpredictable military player.  Russian officials are frustrated too that Trump has not yet filled key senior staff positions at the State Department, leaving Russian diplomats feeling they have nobody to work with.    “To have cooperation, you need someone to promote it from the other end,” Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, testily told a news briefing last week. Moscow seems to have been taken aback by the strength of Congressional opposition to Trump overseeing a rapprochement with Russia, a factor that would make it hard for him to ease sanctions even if he wanted to. In a further reverse for the Kremlin, senior U.S. senators have introduced legislation that would give Congress the right to review any move to relax sanctions on Russia. Sergei Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, told state television last week Moscow was aware of how difficult the domestic U.S. scene was becoming for Russia.    “Does the lack of political consensus inside the U.S. create problems for our bilateral relations?” Kislyak asked rhetorically. “That is an objective reality.” There were muted expectations in Moscow that Trump might move fast to reverse Obama’s expulsion in December of 35 suspected Russian spies over allegations of Russian-backed cyber attacks on U.S. election campaign groups to help Trump win. Obama shut down two Russian compounds at the same time that he said were used by Russian personnel for “intelligence-related purposes”. Back then, Trump praised Putin for refraining from retaliation, calling him “very smart”. But Trump has given no indication since that he will roll back any of the measures. One of the biggest setbacks for Moscow followed a flare-up in fighting in eastern Ukraine where government forces are facing off against pro-Russian separatist forces.  Before the escalation in January, which both sides blame on each other, the Trump administration gave the impression it was open to looking at reviewing sanctions on Russia. Afterwards, Nikki Haley, the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, blamed Russia for the fighting and said Ukraine-related sanctions would not be lifted until Moscow returned Crimea to Ukraine, something Russia says it will never do. Flynn’s resignation may hurt more, though. “Flynn was the main lobbyist for the ‘big deal with Putin’ project,” said Russian opposition activist Ilya Yashin.   “There was nobody in Trump’s entourage who so persistently lobbied to cancel the sanctions as Flynn. Today is a black day for Kremlin diplomacy and for Putin personally.” ",0
"Trump's heartland voters shrug off global uproar over immigration ban  (This version of the Jan 29 story has been corrected to show former Senate Republican leader Trent Lott is from Mississippi not Missouri) By Laila Kearney (Reuters) - Many of President Donald Trump’s core political supporters had a simple message on Sunday for the fiercest opponents of his immigration ban: Calm down.  The relaxed reaction among the kind of voters who drove Trump’s historic upset victory - working- and middle-class residents of Midwest and the South - provided a striking contrast to the uproar that has gripped major coastal cities, where thousands of protesters flocked to airports where immigrants had been detained. In the St. Louis suburb of Manchester, Missouri, 72-year-old Jo Ann Tieken characterized the president as bringing reason into an overheated debate.  “Somebody has to stand up, be the grown up and see what we can do better to check on people coming in,” she said. “I’m all for everybody to stop and take a breath … Just give it a chance.”  By executive order on Friday, Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries – Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen – and temporarily halted the entry of refugees. In the electoral strongholds for Trump, residents seemed nonplussed about the uproar flashing across their television screens. They shrugged off concerns about botched execution, damage to foreign relations and legal challenges across the country.  In New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities, Trump’s action set off an outpouring of anger.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, evoked an image of the Statue of Liberty weeping. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York teared up himself on camera as he seethed over the “mean-spirited and un-American” immigration ban. Veterans in government agencies, including the Homeland Security and State departments, blasted Trump’s team for what they called slipshod planning and scant interagency communication, criticism the White House rejected.  At airports, security officials also struggled to consistently enforce vague rules.  But allegations of operational or administrative blunders may do little to dampen enthusiasm for a president who rose to power on a populist and protectionist platform, political analysts said.  Louise Ingram, a 69-year-old retiree from Troy, Alabama, said she forgave the new administration a few “glitches,” such as widespread confusion over treatment of green card holders, as it moved to protect U.S. citizens from attacks. “I’m not opposed to immigrants,” she said. “I just want to make sure they are safe to come in.”  A senior Trump administration official said political considerations had little to do with the executive orders. They rather represent a reaction to the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California; the Boston Marathon bombing; and multiple attacks by radicalized groups in Europe.  “The reality is that the situation that exists today in parts of France, Germany and parts of Belgium is not a situation that we want replicated inside the United States,” one official told Reuters. Candace Wheater, a 60-year-old retired school cafeteria worker from Spring Lake, Michigan, also referenced the attacks in Brussels and Paris.  “Look at what’s happening in Europe,” she said. “I don’t dare travel there, out of fear.” Steve Hirsch, 63, from Manassas, Virginia, drove to Washington’s Dulles airport on Sunday to pick somebody up, rather than to protest as hundreds of others did. He said he supported Trump’s order. “A country is not a country if it doesn’t have borders,” he added. He lauded Trump’s actions as a calculated step toward the larger goal of tightening border security. “He probably went as far as he thought he could,” Hirsch said. “You can’t ban everybody in the world, but I think it’s prudent considering the conditions in certain places in the world.” Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader from Mississippi who is now a lawyer in Washington, D.C., said the orders made sense to “working-class Americans in the real world.”  “Out in the rest of the country, people are excited to see the president moving forward with securing the border,” he said. University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato agreed that the weekend protests over the executive orders would not hurt Trump politically. “His base is as firm as ever,” he said. “What he’s lost in the very early polls is the Republicans who were never Trumpers and ended up voting for Trump.” Trump opponents have succeeded in winning some early court decisions that could undermine the practical impact of his executive orders, but Sabato said his base would perceive those as attacks from liberal elites.  Trump could eventually lose support if he fails to keep promises important to regions that supported him, such as delivering jobs to the so-called Rust Belt, the Midwestern states dotted by dying factory towns.  Whatever Trump ultimately accomplishes, his election has ushered in a new extreme of political polarization to an already deeply divided country.  “I just have not found a single person who has any neutrality at all about Donald Trump,” Sabato said. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 40-year-old teacher Trista Carles said she had been ordered to keep her views about Trump out of the classroom.  “We were told to be Switzerland,” she said. “We’re not allowed to take any sides or views.”  She has her own opinions, of course, and said she appreciated that Trump, in his blunt way, gave voice to them “with no sugar-coating.”  “I think it’s just too easy to get into our country and stay illegally,” she said. “I feel like he is going to – to the best of his abilities – make a lot of things he said happen.” ",0
"Republicans strike back at new U.S. ban on forced arbitration WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans lawmakers on Tuesday started trying to kill a brand-new U.S. rule prohibiting banks and credit card companies from requiring customers who open new accounts to sign an agreement that they will not join a group lawsuit in the event of a dispute. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Monday finalized the new rule banning “mandatory arbitration clauses” requiring consumers to forego class-action suits and instead settle disputes in negotiations overseen by arbitrators frequently hired by companies. The rule immediately ran into fierce opposition by Wall Street and Republicans who control both Congress and the White House. They have long criticized the consumer agency, which is run by a Democrat, Richard Cordray. Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Banking Committee, has already announced he is drafting a resolution to kill the rule. His fellow Republican Senator Pat Toomey, chair of the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, said he is considering a similar step.  Republican lawmakers plan to eliminate the rule, using a law that allows Congress to undo new regulations with simple majority votes in both chambers and a signature from the president. Analysts and consumer advocates have said the agency’s rule may survive the Congressional challenge. Still, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is contemplating a legal challenge and Trump administration officials are also looking at ways to kill the rule. Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst for the investment firm Compass Point Research & Trading, said the rule has a slightly better than 50 percent chance of surviving in Congress. Joe Valenti, who tracks the issue for the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said the House of Representatives was unified against the rule, which opponents have argued benefits class-action lawyers, not consumers. “It comes down to the Senate,” said Valenti, noting that the rule would survive if only three Republicans in that chamber switched sides. That is possible, said Ed Mierzwinksi, the consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Groups. He noted that Senate Republicans have struggled to gather enough votes for majorities and the calendar is swollen with pressing legislation and confirmation hearings. In addition, Mierzwinksi said, senators may be leery of appearing to side with Wall Street against consumers. He noted that Wells Fargo & Co used clauses in its account-opening agreements to block customers from suing over its phantom account scandal. Supporters of the rule say mandatory arbitration denies citizens their day in court and is rigged in favor of big firms. They say litigants banding together in a class-action lawsuit have a better chance of getting companies to answer publicly for illegal activities and that fears of such a suit can discourage law breaking. The consumer protection agency wrote the rule after conducting a lengthy, multi-year study of the issue. Opponents of the rule say the study is flawed and that arbitration is cheaper and faster than class-action lawsuits and produces better awards for consumers. The Chamber is exploring a prompt legal challenge to the rule, said Matt Webb, senior vice president for its legal reform institute. Another possible challenge could come from the acting comptroller of the currency, Keith Noreika. He is laying groundwork to invoke an untested provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law that allows the council of the country’s top financial regulators to nullify a consumer agency rule if they decide it threatens the safety and soundness of the banking system. Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America and former CFPB assistant director, said a lawsuit will probably fail because the law says the agency can restrict arbitration as long as it hews to its study.  He said the Dodd-Frank provision that the comptroller’s office is looking at was meant to keep risks to the financial system at bay.  “To suggest that this rule would cause a financial crisis is ridiculous on its face,” he said.

"Orlando Gunman Was Shot at Least 8 Times, Autopsy Finds - The New York Times The authorities in Florida said Friday that Omar Mateen, whose June 12 rampage  at an Orlando nightclub left 49 other people dead, was shot at least eight times by police officers who responded to the deadly mass shooting. The Orange County medical examiner’s office released its report of Mr. Mateen’s autopsy on Friday, the same day local officials began to distribute their   findings about the victims of the attack, during which Mr. Mateen pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State. The 32 death reports released on Friday were the first time that the authorities so publicly cataloged and detailed the injuries of the dead. The medical examiner’s office said in a statement that it had begun notifying family members on Thursday that the reports would be released under the state’s public records law. The office said it expected to publish all of its assessments by Wednesday night. Officials reported their findings about the deaths of 28 men, including Mr. Mateen, and four women. The youngest victim whose autopsy was published was an    woman the oldest was a    man. Most of those who were killed died of multiple gunshot wounds, the autopsies showed. The placing of the shots varied some people were wounded in the head, while others were shot in the torso, and still others were struck in their arms, neck or lower extremities. It was not clear on Friday whether anyone besides Mr. Mateen had been killed from police gunfire. Citing the continuing inquiry, a spokeswoman for the Orlando police referred a request for comment to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which did not respond to a message. But Orlando’s police chief, John Mina, left open the possibility in June, when he said, “That’s part of the investigation, but here’s what I will tell you: Those killings are on the suspect. ” The reports had a certain uniformity  —   each person’s death, for instance, was declared a homicide  —   but the scores of pages also carried small hints about individual lives. One man had been wearing two beaded bracelets when he was gunned down, while another young woman had worn “an elaborate yellow metal necklace” to Pulse. Another person had carried his photo identification from the Y. M. C. A. Mr. Mateen, his autopsy report noted, had been dressed in tan pants, a holster attached to a black belt. He was struck by gunfire in several places, including the chest, the abdomen and the foot. Mr. Mateen died after a protracted standoff with the police, who feared that he would set off explosives, as he had threatened to do. Once the authorities gained access to the nightclub with the aid of an armored vehicle, officials traded gunfire with Mr. Mateen, who was 29. The medical examiner’s office said Friday that it would not discuss individual cases. But in an interview in June, the county’s chief medical examiner, Dr. Joshua D. Stephany, said it appeared that all of the victims had died quickly. “It doesn’t appear anyone suffered,” he said. “Everyone went down where they were. I don’t think anyone had prolonged suffering. ”",0
"Hamas says its security chief wounded in Gaza car bombing GAZA (Reuters) - Hamas  security chief in the Gaza Strip was wounded in a car bombing on Friday in what the Islamist group called a failed assassination attempt. The attack came as rival factions are trying to implement a new agreement meant to end a 10-year rift that has effectively split the Palestinian territories between Hamas in Gaza and the more mainstream Fatah in the occupied West Bank. Tawfeeq Abu Naeem, Hamas  head of security in Gaza and a strong supporter of the reconciliation deal, was lightly wounded when his car exploded outside a mosque, Hamas said in a statement. Hamas, which has been quick to blame Israel for similar attacks in the past, did not say who it believed was behind the bombing, suggesting it could also be the work of a radical jihadist Salafi group that opposes the Palestinian rapprochement. Asked about the explosion in Gaza, Israel s military said it did not comment on foreign reports. Hamas has stepped up a security campaign against Salafi groups and recently detained a senior operative. Hamas also has improved ties with Egypt, which is battling Islamist groups across the border in the Sinai peninsula. Some disputes arose this week in implementing the reconciliation deal. Senior Fatah officials traveled to Gaza this week from the West Bank to take control of two government offices there, but they turned back, saying Hamas officials refused their authority. A Fatah spokesman later said the issue was being resolved. ",0

"White House: no change to 'one China' policy after Trump call with Taiwan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday said there was “no change” to the United States’ longstanding “one China” policy after President-elect Donald Trump spoke with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. “We remain firmly committed to our ‘one China’ policy,” said Ned Price, a national security spokesman for President Barack Obama. “Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-Strait relations.” ",0
"The unexpected and ingenious strategy of Obama's second term Presidents often turn more moderate to make gains in their final years. Think of Bill Clinton's 1997 budget deal, or George W. Bush's 2007 (failed) immigration reform effort, or Ronald Reagan's 1986 tax reforms. Second terms can feel like new presidencies.

President Obama's increasingly successful second term has been the exception to that rule. It's been a concentrated, and arguably jaded, version of his first term. The candidate who was elected to bring the country together has found he can get more done if he acts alone — and if he lets Congress do the same.

That has been the big, quiet surprise of Obama's second term. Congress has become, if anything, more productive. And that speaks to a broader lesson Obama has learned about polarization in Congress: Since he's part of the problem, ignoring Congress can be part of the solution.

Obama's diplomatic breakthroughs with Cuba and Iran call back to a controversial promise Obama made in the 2008 primary but seemed to abandon once he won the White House: to negotiate with dictators with few or no preconditions. This was among the biggest fights of the Democratic primary and the most radical promises of Obama's campaign — but it seemed almost completely forgotten in the first years of his presidency.

Obama's first-term foreign policy was largely defined by George W. Bush's wars. It's only been in Obama's second term that the foreign policy philosophy he previewed in the 2008 campaign has really been visible — and where Obama has shown himself to be to the left of many in the Democratic Party.

Even some congressional Democrats have balked at his negotiations with Cuba and Iran. But not only is Congress largely irrelevant to these deals (at least unless the opposition can overturn a presidential veto, which they almost certainly can't) but Obama doesn't have much pressing legislation before Congress, which makes it safer for him to anger them. In that way, Obama's increasing distance from Congress has been a boon to his foreign policy efforts.

The results will profoundly shape Obama's foreign policy legacy. As my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote, ""Obama has reestablished productive diplomacy as the central task of a progressive foreign policy, and as a viable alternative approach to dealing with countries the GOP foreign policy establishment would rather bomb. He established a viable alternative to the liberal hawks that dominated Democratic thinking during the Bush years, and held positions of influence on Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign. And he developed a cadre of aides who can carry on that legacy to future Democratic administrations, and keep a tradition of dovishness alive.""

But it's not just foreign policy where Obama has swung left. When he ran for president in 2008, he opposed same-sex marriage. It wasn't until 2012 that he ""evolved"" on the issue. But by 2015, he was embracing marriage equality as part of his legacy. He even turned his home into a symbol of celebration:

Similarly, Obama has sought to use executive action to achieve in his second term what Congress wouldn't permit in his first: sweeping action on both immigration and climate change.

In some ways, the immigration action is the most telling of the two. Prior to his second term, Obama had repeatedly told immigration advocates that he simply didn't have the power to stop deportations on a significant scale. ""I am president,"" he told Univision in 2010, ""I am not king.""

But Obama eventually decided that the president had more power than he initially thought. Similarly, he is pushing strong regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

Both efforts show a basic reality of Obama's second term: Rather than working to find more compromise in Congress, which would necessitate choosing different issues and agreeing to much more modest solutions, Obama is sidestepping Congress with more aggressive, more polarizing actions. To put it another way, he's prioritizing the liberal policy outcomes he promised in the 2008 campaign above the compromise-oriented political approach he promised in the 2008 campaign.

Given Obama's actions, you might expect Congress to have devolved into yet more partisan rancor and paralysis. But over the past year, the opposite has happened. Democrats and Republicans shocked everyone by coming up with a fix to Medicare's broken payments formula. The Senate agreed on a replacement to No Child Left Behind. There have been no government shutdowns or debt ceiling disasters. And Republicans have even been willing to make some common ground with Obama on trade authority.

Evidence of Congress's relative productivity can be found elsewhere, too. The Bipartisan Policy Center keeps up a ""Healthy Congress Index"" that ""tracks key metrics like substantive days in session, amendments offered, and bills reported out of committee."" Of late, Congress is looking a whole lot healthier.

Which, in a way, makes a twisted kind of sense. Obama is a polarizing figure, and his efforts to pass legislation were part of what was polarizing Congress. Obama eventually realized he couldn't solve a problem that was created by his very presence. And so he's more or less left Congress to do its own thing — particularly since Republicans won the Senate in 2014.

Now that they've stopped arguing so much over Obama, both sides in Congress have more time and more inclination to work with each other — and, surprisingly, to work with Obama on the rare occasions when there's an obvious common ground, as proved true on trade authority. The result is that even as Obama's second term has become more liberal, the agenda he's actually pursuing with Congress has become more conservative — and more successful.",0
"OPINION: Both sides of abortion debate need to talk more honestly “We should see human life as sacred and recognize its immeasurable worth in every human condition,” Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback said in his 2015 State of the State address. “Whether at the beginning of life or the end of life, Kansas is the most pro-life state in America. And we are not going back.” On April 7, he kept his word, signing into law the Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, which states that, starting July 1, a person who, “with the purpose of causing the death of a living unborn child,” knowingly dismembers and extracts such an unborn “child, one piece at a time from the uterus,” may be charged with a Class A misdemeanor if it is his or her first violation of the law. Subsequent violations render a person liable for a felony conviction and carry a jail sentence of up to nine months. The Kansas act is the first state law since Roe v. Wade to block women’s access to a commonly used method — medically known as dilation and extraction — for second-trimester abortions, which account for just under 10 percent of the approximately 1 million abortions performed in the United States each year. It’s an unsurprising development, given Kansas’ track record on abortion regulation and the pattern of state-level abortion legislation in the last 18 months. The law’s rather striking name garnered national attention for its use of the word “dismemberment.” It gathers its rhetorical power, ironically, from the decision of earlier reproductive-rights advocates to frame the debate not as a morally complex issue but rather as a simple issue of women’s choice. But any argument that focuses just on women’s interests, or alternatively, only on the rights of the fetus, is ultimately misleading.

Why didn’t Kansas choose more neutral language that would have been consistent with some of its other statutes, such as the Pharmacy Practice Act and the Uniform Controlled Substance Act? After all, the vote — 98 for the bill and 26 against it — would not have been significantly different had the bill had a more innocuous name. A possible reason is that Kansas lawmakers wanted to be brutally honest. Second-trimester abortions performed using the dilation and extraction method do involve removing a fetus in pieces from a uterus. Perhaps those lawmakers thought learning that fact might change some American’s minds about the moral status of abortion (though it would change them by inducing disgust, not by providing additional reasons for thinking that abortion is a morally complex issue). A less benign but utterly familiar possible reason is to put critics of the bill on their back foot, cast as defenders of the dismemberment of unborn children. Politicians and advocates of all kinds are adept at framing their side of a debate in terms that guarantee the maximum amount of awkwardness for any expression of dissent. The expression “pro-choice” as a label for supporters of the right to abortion was strategically adopted to counter the rhetorically powerful label “pro-life.” While the term “pro-choice” captured the morally central idea that each of us should be free to decide whether we become parents, it also abetted the gradual but substantial intrusion of state restrictions across the country into Americans’ reproductive lives. Abortion cannot be described as a morally neutral act akin, as philosopher Mary Anne Warren once suggested, to “cutting one’s hair.” It’s an act that kills a fetus and ends the development of a very young member of our species. Had reproductive-rights activists told the whole moral story about abortion from the beginning, there would have been less rhetorical wind for the sails of legislation such as Kansas’. In other words, full disclosure about the moral dimensions of abortion would have prevented states like Kansas from even appearing to occupy the moral high ground when they enact regulations allegedly designed only to protect unborn children.

This point applies to both sides; opponents of abortion access have also been quite selective in the moral tale they tell. For if the death of a fetus is morally significant simply because it is human, so too is the well-being of the woman carrying it. If having an abortion is far more serious than having a haircut, then giving birth to a child is an even more morally consequential act for the biological mother as well as for the adult who the child will become. Hence arguments that focus exclusively or primarily on the fetus and ignore the interests of women are dishonest in their own ways.

Abortion is a horrendously complicated moral issue, so complex that many Americans find it difficult to express a clear view about it. This difficulty is evident in recent polling results that show that while 28 percent of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in all circumstances and 50 percent believe that it should be legal in some circumstances, only 47 percent describe themselves as pro-choice. One diagnosis for what’s going on here is that people acknowledge that both abortion itself (the killing of the fetus) and abortion access are morally significant, because each intimately affects how and whether a human life continues.  As I have written before, over the past 40 years the terms of the abortion debate have accreted new and unhelpful connotations. “Pro-choice” now connotes the view that abortion is morally permissible under any circumstances and that all that matters is the pregnant woman’s wishes, while “pro-life” connotes an ugly and pernicious view of women and of feminist commitments more generally. Thus linguistic entities that began as pithy slogans expressing moral views no longer perform that function and are in fact obstacles to any productive conversation about abortion and abortion policy in the U.S. Planned Parenthood belatedly recognized it was time for a linguistic change in 2013 when it produced a YouTube video encouraging people to dispense with the life-versus-choice rhetoric. In its place, the organization recommends returning to the idea that abortion is a “personal decision.” That term, unfortunately, appears to represent an even deeper retreat from moral honesty about abortion. We should agree with Planned Parenthood that elected officials ought not legally prohibit women from acting on their reproductive health care decisions. However, we do not need to deny that abortion kills a biological human being. In suggesting that an individual’s choices fully determine the moral permissibility of her actions, reproductive rights advocates continue to play into the hands of politicians who favor banning abortion. Women will continue to face unwanted, unintended and life-threatening pregnancies, and according to the Guttmacher Institute, 3 in 10 American women will have at least one abortion by age 45. Even so, most reasonable people agree that reducing the incidence of abortion in America would be a good thing. That will not be achieved by legislation such as the Kansas law, which is little more than a cynical use of language designed to shame and horrify. People on all sides of this discussion need to step with both feet onto the moral high ground. It will do no good to limp along with just one foot in the truth — on the one hand, that abortion kills human fetuses or, on the other, that women’s freedom of choice is all that matters. Both matter, and the fact that they do demands of us serious personal reflection about how we act as well as compassionate public policy grounded in the real world.",0
"’SNL’ Star Michael Che Not Sorry for Calling Boston ’Most Racist City’ Saturday Night Live star Michael Che is not apologizing for calling Boston, Massachusetts the “most racist city” he has ever visited.

"Mexico presidential hopeful rejects comparisons to Venezuela MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The current front-runner for Mexico s 2018 presidential election on Sunday rejected comparisons of his leftist party to Venezuela s socialist government, saying his movement was a Mexican-made revolution against rampant corruption. Former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has led early opinion polls for the 2018 election, supported by frustration with rising crime and corruption scandals that have battered the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).  Just last week, President Enrique Pena Nieto compared the 63-year-old to Venezuela s Nicolas Maduro, suggesting Lopez Obrador could unleash economic chaos if he wins office.  (They are) saying that if MORENA wins Mexico, it s going to be like Venezuela. That s a lie!  Lopez Obrador told a crowd of thousands of supporters who rallied at a monument in the nation s capital.  We re not taking inspiration from any foreign government ... Neither Maduro, nor Donald Trump.  Earlier this year, Pena Nieto s PRI sought to brand Lopez Obrador s National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) an ally of Venezuela. [nL1N1IX09K] Analysts have compared Lopez Obrador s populist appeal to that of Trump. While Trump blamed immigrants and free trade deals for declining incomes among working-class Americans, Lopez Obrador s message is that corruption is keeping Mexicans poor.  People are fed up with corruption,  Lopez Obrador said.  This is the cancer that we are going to end with our movement.  In his annual state of the nation address on Saturday, Pena Nieto did not directly attack Lopez Obrador but he said Mexico faced the choice between backing his reforms, like the opening of the energy sector, that were  transforming  Mexico or  a model from the past that has failed.  Lopez Obrador was the runner-up in Mexico s past two presidential contests. A victory by him could mark a leftward shift in Latin America s second-largest economy, where centrist technocrats have held sway for decades, and further complicate relations with top trade partner the United States. Maduro s government has been criticized by Washington, the United Nations and major Latin American nations for cracking down on protests and failing to allow the entry of foreign humanitarian aid to ease a severe economic crisis. Critics of Lopez Obrador have long sought to depict him as an economic liability, likening him to Maduro s fiery, late predecessor, Hugo Chavez, in previous runs for the presidency.  Pena Nieto told pure lies. He says all these things, but it s all corruption,  said 71-year-old Ana Maria Hurtado as she stood among the crowd at the Lopez Obrador rally. ",0
"Trumps history of corruption is mind-boggling. So why is Clinton supposedly the corrupt one
 In the heat of a presidential campaign, youd think that a story about one partys nominee giving a large contribution to a state attorney general who promptly shut down an inquiry into that nominees scam university would be enormous news. But we continue to hear almost nothing about what happened between Donald Trump and Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.

I raised this issue last week, but its worth an update as well as some contextualization. The story re-emerged last week when The Posts David A. Fahrenthold reported that Trump paid a penalty to the IRS after his foundation made an illegal contribution to Bondis PAC. While the Trump organization characterizes that as a bureaucratic oversight, the basic facts are that Bondis office had received multiple complaints from Floridians who said they were cheated by Trump University; while they were looking into it and considering whether to join a lawsuit over Trump University filed by the attorney general of New York State, Bondi called Trump and asked him for a $25,000 donation; shortly after getting the check, Bondis office dropped the inquiry.

At this point we should note that everything here may be completely innocent. Perhaps Bondi didnt realize her office was looking into Trump University. Perhaps the fact that Trumps foundation made the contribution (which, to repeat, is illegal) was just a mix-up. Perhaps when Trump reimbursed the foundation from his personal account, he didnt realize thats not how the law works (the foundation would have to get its money back from Bondis PAC; he could then make a personal donation if he wanted). Perhaps Bondis decision not to pursue the case against Trump was perfectly reasonable. 

But heres the thing: We dont know the answers to those questions, because almost nobody seems to be pursuing them.

For instance, there was only one mention of this story on any of the five Sunday shows, when John Dickerson asked Chris Christie about it on Face the Nation (Christie took great umbrage: I cant believe, John, that anyone would insult Pam Bondi that way). And the comparison with stories about Hillary Clintons emails or the Clinton Foundation is extremely instructive. Whenever we get some new development in any of those Clinton stories, you see blanket coverage  every cable network, every network news program, every newspaper investigates it at length. And even when the new information serves to exonerate Clinton rather than implicate her in wrongdoing, the coverage still emphasizes that the whole thing just raises questions about her integrity.

The big difference is that there are an enormous number of reporters who get assigned to write stories about those issues regarding Clinton. The story of something like the Clinton Foundation gets stretched out over months and months with repeated tellings, always with the insistence that questions are being raised and the implication that shady things are going on, even if there isnt any evidence at a particular moment to support that idea.

When it comes to Trump, on the other hand, weve seen a very different pattern. Heres what happens: A story about some kind of corrupt dealing emerges, usually from the dogged efforts of one or a few journalists; it gets discussed for a couple of days; and then it disappears. Someone might mention it now and again, but the news organizations dont assign a squad of reporters to look into every aspect of it, so no new facts are brought to light and no new stories get written.

The end result of this process is that because of all that repeated examination of Clintons affairs, people become convinced that she must be corrupt to the core. Its not that there isnt plenty of negative coverage of Trump, because of course there is, but its focused mostly on the crazy things he says on any given day.

But the truth is that youd have to work incredibly hard to find a politician who has the kind of history of corruption, double-dealing, and fraud that Donald Trump has. The number of stories which could potentially deserve hundreds and hundreds of articles is absolutely staggering. Heres a partial list:

Trumps casino bankruptcies, which left investors holding the bag while he skedaddled with their money
Trumps habit of refusing to pay contractors who had done work for him, many of whom are struggling small businesses
Trump University, which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation, but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashed.
The Trump Institute, another get-rich-quick scheme in which Trump allowed a couple of grifters to use his name to bilk people out of their money
The Trump Network, a multi-level marketing venture (a.k.a. pyramid scheme) that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitamins
Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally, and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they did
Trumps employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, which involves a claim that he cant find Americans to do the work
Trumps use of hundreds of undocumented workers from Poland in the 1980s, who were paid a pittance for their illegal work
Trumps history of being charged with housing discrimination
Trumps connections to mafia figures involved in New York construction
The time Trump paid the Federal Trade Commission $750,000 over charges that he violated anti-trust laws when trying to take over a rival casino company
The fact that Trump is now being advised by Roger Ailes, who was forced out as Fox News chief when dozens of women came forward to charge him with sexual harassment. According to the allegations, Ailess behavior was positively monstrous; as just one indicator, his abusive and predatory actions toward women were so well-known and so loathsome that in 1968 the morally upstanding folks in the Nixon administration refused to allow him to work there despite his key role in getting Nixon elected.
And that last one is happening right now. To repeat, the point is not that these stories have never been covered, because they have. The point is that they get covered briefly, then everyone in the media moves on. If any of these kinds of stories involved Clinton, news organizations would rush to assign multiple reporters to them, those reporters would start asking questions, and wed learn more about all of them.

Thats important, because we may have reached a point where the frames around the candidates are locked in: Trump is supposedly the crazy/bigoted one, and Clinton is supposedly the corrupt one. Once we decide that those are the appropriate lenses through which the two candidates are to be viewed, it shapes the decisions the media make every day about which stories are important to pursue.

And it means that to a great extent, for all the controversy he has caused and all the unflattering stories in the press about him, Trump is still being let off the hook.",0

"Congress votes to avert shutdown, sends Trump stopgap spending bill WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Thursday averted a government shutdown just one day before federal funding was due to expire, sending President Donald Trump a bill to provide just enough money to keep agencies operating through Jan. 19. With lawmakers eager to begin a holiday recess until Jan. 3, the House of Representatives and Senate scurried to pass the hastily written bill by votes of 231-188 and 66-32, respectively. When Congress returns, lawmakers will immediately have to get back to work on appropriating more money for a fiscal year that already will be three months old. They will try to pass an “omnibus” spending bill to fund the government from Jan. 19 through Sept. 30. Negotiators have been struggling for months over thorny issues such as the amount of defense-spending increases versus increases for other domestic programs, including medical research, opioid treatment and “anti-terrorism” activities. Fiscal hawks, meanwhile, are angry that Congress is again moving to bust through spending caps that had been designed to tamp down mounting federal debt. But some of those same lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress earlier in the week voted for a sweeping tax bill that will add $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to a national debt that already stands at $20 trillion. With the clock ticking toward a deadline of midnight on Friday when government funding would run out, Democrats in the House and Senate made a strong pitch for including protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, popularly known as “Dreamers.” In the end, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups failed. But nearly all of the House’s 193 Democrats and 29 of the Senate’s 46 Democrats voted no, in part to protest the lack of action on the immigration measure. Shortly before the House and Senate votes, Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez told reporters, “We’re really tired of tomorrow,” referring to years of failed attempts in Congress to protect Dreamers from deportation, allow them to legally work in the United States and get on a path to citizenship. They will resume their fight in January, aiming to win on the next spending bill or a separate measure. Trump has eliminated Obama-era temporary protections for Dreamers, but has asked Congress to come up with a permanent solution by March. In the meantime, about 122 Dreamers a day are becoming vulnerable to deportation while Congress bickers. Also on Thursday, the Senate put the brakes on another bill that passed the House, which would provide $81 billion in new disaster aid to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states hit by this year’s hurricanes or wildfires. The temporary spending bill did, however, give Trump a modest increase of $4.7 billion for the Department of Defense to be used for missile defense and ship repair. The bill includes $2.85 billion to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program through March and funding for community health centers and the Indian Health Service. The plan also would extend the National Security Agency’s expiring internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, through Jan. 19. Other provisions address funding for veterans, the Coast Guard and flood insurance. Most government programs would be temporarily extended until Jan. 19 at fiscal 2017 levels. ",0
"Exclusive: Zimbabwe's Grace Mugabe says model attacked her with knife JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s First Lady, Grace Mugabe, has denied assaulting South African model Gabriella Engels with an electric cable in a Johannesburg hotel suite last month, saying an  intoxicated and unhinged  Engels attacked her with a knife. In a previously unreported Aug. 17 deposition seen exclusively by Reuters, Mugabe countered 20-year-old Engels  version, portraying herself as the victim after intervening on behalf of her adult sons Chatunga and Robert Junior who were  in trouble with a drunken young woman . The statement said Grace Mugabe, 52 and a contender to replace her 93-year-old husband as Zimbabwe s president, was thinking about filing attempted murder charges. A group representing Engels dismissed the allegations as lies. According to the model, an irate Mugabe burst into the room where she was waiting with two friends to meet Chatunga on Aug. 13 and started laying into her with an electric cable. Photographs taken by Engels  mother soon after the incident showed gashes to the model s head. She also had bruising on her thighs. In her deposition, Mugabe dismissed Engels  version as  malicious allegations  and said she had been attacked after going to help her sons.  She was worried about them and went to see them at their hotel suite,  the statement said.  Upon her arrival, Ms Engels, who was intoxicated and unhinged, attacked Dr. Grace Mugabe with a knife after she was asked to leave the hotel.   Security was left with no other option but to remove Ms Engels from the hotel suite,  it continued. The statement also alleged that Engels had been in a fight with other women at Johannesburg s Taboo nightclub the previous evening and suggested that may have been the cause of her injuries. Afriforum, an Afrikaans civil society group acting on behalf of Engels, denied both accusations.  Gabriella never attacked Grace Mugabe in any way and she did not participate in the fight at Taboo,  Afriforum said.  It is clear that Grace Mugabe is desperately trying to escape responsibility for her own violent behavior by using lies to falsely portray the victim in this case as the perpetrator.  South Africa granted Grace Mugabe diplomatic immunity, allowing her to evade immediate prosecution for assault, although Engels and Afriforum have challenged that decision, saying Mugabe was not in South Africa on official business. They also argued that assault was a  grave crime  that was not covered by diplomatic immunity laws. The decision to let Grace Mugabe return home caused a row in South Africa, with the opposition Democratic Alliance also going to court to overturn the immunity.  According to Zimbabwean intelligence files seen by Reuters, Robert Mugabe lobbied his South African counterpart, Jacob Zuma, to have the issue  solved amicably  and out of court but was stymied by Engels  refusal to accept a settlement.  He is trying to avoid the embarrassment of his wife appearing before the court,  one file, dated Aug. 30, reads.  The problem he is facing is that the woman who was assaulted is refusing to accept any money and she just wants justice to be delivered upon Grace.  Afriforum lawyer Gerrie Nel - best known for prosecuting  South African track star Oscar Pistorius over the shooting of his girlfriend - said last month Engels had been approached with a cash offer but had turned it down. The intelligence report is a part of a series of hundreds of files dating back to 2009 that have come from within Zimbabwe s Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO). Reuters has not been able to establish their original author or final audience. The Aug. 30 report said Mugabe was  changing his attitude  to the case and was now backing Grace while accusing Engels of impropriety.  Mugabe wants people to stop castigating his wife and calling her all sorts of names,  it said.  Mugabe is saying that his wife acted in an angry mood like all other women who find their children being involved with sleeping with whores.  Afriforum chief executive Kallie Kriel said this allegation was an  absolute lie  and part of a deliberate attempt by Harare to undermine Engels  credibility as a witness. A spokesman for Zimbabwe s presidency, which has direct oversight of the CIO, was not immediately available for comment. Zimbabwe s ambassador to South Africa did not respond to a request for comment. Zuma has denied any hand in the affair, telling parliament on Aug. 31:  I am not a lawyer. I don t know the point of law and I was not involved in this process. How it was done, I would be lying if I speculate.  His spokesman declined to elaborate. ",0
"Date Rape Comments by Brooklyn Police Captain Are Condemned - The New York Times The commander of a Brooklyn police precinct has apologized for remarks he made to the media and at a local community meeting last week in which he played down a recent surge in rapes in his neighborhood, saying most were date rapes, not “true stranger rapes. ” In a post on Twitter on Monday afternoon, Capt. Peter R. Rose of the 94th Precinct in Greenpoint said, “I deeply regret the statements I made last week about rape,” adding that his comments “were not meant to minimize the seriousness of sexual assault. ” “Every rape whether it is perpetrated by a stranger or someone known to them is fully investigated,” Captain Rose wrote. “We make no distinction in our response. ” The apology came days after the officer was quoted in an article on the local news website DNAinfo. com about an increase of sexual violence in the neighborhood of Greenpoint, where there were eight reported attacks or attempted attacks in 2015 and 13 last year. Of last year’s cases, three led to arrests, but 10  —   including two allegedly by taxi drivers on young female passengers  —   remain unsolved. In the article, which appeared on Friday, Captain Rose told DNAinfo. com that while every rape should be investigated, the spike in reported assaults was “not a trend that we’re too worried about” because many of them had been committed by acquaintances of the victims. “If there’s a true stranger rape,” Captain Rose went on, “a random guy who picks up a stranger off the street, those are the troubling ones. That person has, like, no moral standards. ” Not long after the interview, Captain Rose elaborated on the unsolved sex assault cases at a meeting of the 94th Precinct community council, where he said some of the attacks had involved   of the victims and others hookup apps like Tinder and thus were “not   rapes where strangers are being dragged off the streets. ” He added that the cases remained open because the victims refused to cooperate with investigators and in some cases left New York for their homes in other states. Both of his comments set off a firestorm of criticism from public officials and advocates for victims of sexual assault who condemned Captain Rose for perpetuating the idea that rapes committed by those who know their victims are somehow less troubling than those committed by strangers. “Rape is rape,” Eric Phillips, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said in remarks published on Friday in a separate article on DNAinfo. “The crime merits no moral qualification and does not involve shades of criminality or degrees of danger. ” The same day, Stephen Davis, a spokesman for the New York Police Department, issued a statement saying, “Captain Rose’s comments did not properly explain the complexity of issues involved with investigating rape complaints. ” The statement added: “All complaints of rape and other types of sexual crimes are taken seriously whether they are committed by domestic partners, acquaintances or strangers. ” Then on Monday, the city’s new police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, wrote a rare opinion article in The Daily News in which he called Captain Rose’s comment “insensitive” and said that they had “left the misleading and inaccurate impression that the N. Y. P. D. treats these types of cases differently. ” Commissioner O’Neill continued: “We do not, either as a matter of policy or practice. ” In his article, the commissioner also said that only some rape victims report their attacks to the police, and he detailed a number of steps that the department has taken in recent years to change that. Those steps, he said, included collaborating with victims’ advocates, sponsoring poster contests on college campuses to encourage students to report rapes and assaults, and creating a hotline so that victims can directly call the detectives who investigate such crimes. Commissioner O’Neill did not say whether Captain Rose would face any disciplinary action. Reports of sexual assault have greatly decreased in the last 20 years. Quoting federal crime statistics from 2010 to 2014,  the Rape Abuse Incest National Network said seven in 10 rapes were committed by someone known to the victim. That was the argument of two dozen demonstrators who gathered in the snow on Tuesday outside the 94th Precinct station house to protest Captain Rose’s statements, with signs reading “Take Rape Seriously” and “Rape Is Always a Crime. ” “It is an outrageous idea that acquaintance rape matters less  —   it isn’t just bad policy, it’s bad law enforcement,” Jane Manning, the director of advocacy for Women’s Justice NOW. “Most rapists target women they know because they’ll have a better chance to get away with it by claiming consent. “The idea that acquaintance matters less is pervasive in our culture,” Ms. Manning added. “Captain Rose was unfortunately saying something out loud that many, many people already believe. ”",0
Trump says never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday he never asked former FBI director James Comey to stop investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn is the first member of Trump’s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian attempts to influence last year’s U.S. presidential election. Trump fired Comey from his post in May. “I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!” Trump tweeted.  ,0
"Former President George H.W. Bush watched inaugural from hospital room AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who has spent nearly a week at a Houston hospital where he is being treated for pneumonia, watched the inauguration of President Donald Trump from the intensive care unit, a family spokesman said. Bush, who at 92 is the nation’s oldest living ex-president, was breathing on his own after a breathing tube was removed on Friday, spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. He is in stable condition in the intensive care unit of Houston Methodist Hospital, he added. “He was extubated this morning, and is breathing well on his own with minimal supplemental oxygen,” McGrath said. Former first lady Barbara Bush, 91, was admitted to the same hospital on Wednesday as a precaution after experiencing fatigue and coughing, McGrath has said. She is being treated for bronchitis and is expected to remain in the hospital over the weekend as a precaution, he said. “Mrs. Bush, meanwhile, continues to feel better and is focusing on spending time with her husband,” the spokesman said. The Bushes marked their 72nd wedding anniversary on Jan. 6. Prior to being hospitalized, they had said they would not attend the inauguration of Republican Trump due to health concerns. He was the only living former president who did not attend the inauguration in Washington, DC. In a letter to the then president-elect, Bush said he and his wife would be with Trump in spirit at the inauguration and wished him the best. Bush, a Republican, did not endorse Trump in his race against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.      ",0
"Minor New Zealand parties in focus as hotly contested election gets tighter WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The rising popularity of New Zealand s Labour Party in hotly contested elections is making it less likely that the nationalist New Zealand First Party will play kingmaker, poll averages released on Friday show. The uncertainty over which combination of parties will decide the next government is worsening an already topsy-turvy election, previously seen as a slam dunk for the center-right National Party, which has ruled for almost a decade. Since taking over as leader last month, charismatic politician Jacinda Ardern has almost single-handedly changed the chances of her Labour Party at the Sept. 23 election.  When I go out and knock on doors...there is a feeling for change, there is,  Marama Fox, a leader of the M ori Party, said at a televised debate between leaders of smaller parties, referring to Labour s newfound popularity.  Fox s party, which campaigns for the rights of indigenous New Zealanders, could play a crucial role in determining the next government. Though it has been in a coalition with National for nine years, Fox said she could work with Labour. Support for newly invigorated Labour rose to 41.8 percent in opinion polls, nudging above the National Party s 41.1 percent, figures released by media showed. That put the center-left opposition party closer to being able to form a government with the Green Party, polling at around 5.4 percent, and the M ori Party, which posted support of about 1.2 percent.  Alternatively Labour could join forces with New Zealand First, which slipped to 7.9 percent and had previously been thought likely to determine which major party governed. Green Party leader James Shaw would not rule out a deal with New Zealand First, but expressed reluctance, as the party s outspoken leader would not commit to either National or Labour.  He s a bad date,  Shaw said of Peters  last-minute decision to skip the debate.  He s stood us up tonight... he s completely unreliable and you don t know which way he s going to go.  But if the Green Party fell further, sinking below the support threshold of 5 percent for seats in parliament, that would put New Zealand First in an even stronger position.  It is really unusual... it s all about which pieces land where,  said Grant Duncan, political analyst at Auckland University. Minor parties often have an outsize role in New Zealand s proportional representation system, in which a party, or combination of parties, needs 61 of Parliament s 120 members - usually about 48 percent of the vote - to form a government.

"Factbox: Trump fills top jobs for his administration (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he would name retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The following is a list of Republican Trump’s selections for top jobs in his administration. All the posts but that of national security adviser require Senate confirmation: Mattis is a retired Marine Corps general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname “Mad Dog.” He was once rebuked for saying in 2005: “It’s fun to shoot some people.” Mnuchin, 53, is a relatively little-known but successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California’s largest bank. The bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Ross, 78, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross & Co. His net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, Ross has helped shape the Trump campaign’s views on trade policy. He blames the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which entered into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization for causing massive U.S. factory job losses. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. Chao is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Company. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TOM PRICE Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House of Representatives’ Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY Haley, a 44-year-old Republican, has been governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools.  Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. The son of a country-store owner, the senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. Carson is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama, but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign policy. Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government’s sweeping collection of Americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.

"Trump reassures farmers immigration crackdown not aimed at their workers WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the U.S. farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce, according to farmers and officials who met with him.     At a roundtable on farm labor at the White House last month, Trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas.           “He assured us we would have plenty of access to workers,” said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of 14 participants at the April 25 meeting with Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. During the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. Some farmers told Trump they often cannot find Americans willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants. They said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the H-2A visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers. The White House declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as “very productive.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment on the April meeting.  About half of U.S. crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two-thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Labor’s National Agriculture Workers’ Survey.  During the roundtable, Luke Brubaker, a dairy farmer from Pennsylvania, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county.  The employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, Brubaker told the gathering at the White House.  Trump said he wanted to help and asked Secretary Perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts. While other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed,  participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor “than about anything else we talked about,”  said Bill Northey, a farmer and Iowa’s secretary of agriculture. Tom Demaline, president of Willoway Nurseries in Ohio, said he told the president about his struggles with the H-2A guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years. He told Trump the program works in concept, but not in practice. “I brought up the bureaucracy and red tape,” he said. “If the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. You are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right.” While use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas Employers who import workers with H-2A visas must provide free transportation to and from the United States as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.  Steve Scaroni, whose company Fresh Harvest brings in thousands of foreign H-2A workers for growers in California’s Central valley, says, however, that he could find work for even more people if he had more places to house them.  For a related photo essay click on:  reut.rs/2qdtfnb Trump recently signed another executive order titled “Buy American, Hire American,” calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including Trump’s own resorts. Trump also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in the United States illegally and speeding up deportations. Roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but Trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers. “He has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen,” said meeting attendee Steve Troxler, North Carolina’s agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself. The farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short-term and permanent workers. They said there should be a program to help long-time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents.  Last Tuesday, Democrats in the House and Senate said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a “blue card” to protect them from deportation.  Brubaker, the Pennsylvania farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the president’s support to make it a bipartisan effort.  “The administration has got something started here,” he said of the meeting with farm leaders. “It’s about time something happens.”   ",0
"Violence prompts U.S. Congress to discuss militant threats WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel next month will hold a hearing on violent extremism, including threats from domestic militants, following a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned deadly. The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, Republican Michael McCaul, announced the Sept. 12 hearing in a letter to the panel’s top Democrat, Bennie Thompson. The committee holds a hearing once a year, around the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, to discuss worldwide threats. A committee aide said the Charlottesville protests had  prompted the decision to broaden the hearing to include threats from domestic militants. But Thompson said the move was “not adequate or appropriate” to address his request for a hearing on threats from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups. “The September 12 hearing to cover worldwide threats is an annual hearing that was already scheduled prior to the domestic attacks this weekend,” Thompson said. “It will not allow us to go into the depth necessary to address the far-ranging and multifaceted aspects of the threat posed by domestic terrorist threats from white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups.” The Homeland Security Committee will invite leaders of the Homeland Security Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Counterterrorism Center, McCaul said. “We must stand together and reject racism, bigotry, and prejudice, including the hateful ideologies promoted by neo-Nazis, the KKK, and all other white supremacy groups,” McCaul wrote in his response to Democrats’ request for a hearing. A 32-year-old woman was killed on Saturday in Charlottesville when a car plowed into a rival protest to white supremacist demonstrators. A 20-year-old Ohio man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies has been charged with murder.  President Donald Trump on Tuesday said both sides were to blame for the violence, drawing condemnation from both fellow Republicans and Democrats for failing to single out the white nationalists. ",0
"Germany watching Trump's Iran decision with 'great concern' BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is worried that U.S. President Donald Trump will decide this week that Iran is not respecting a two-year-old deal to curb its nuclear programme and fears such a step will worsen the security situation in the Middle East. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said Germany was prepared to work with the United States to change Iran s behaviour in the region but  we do not want to see this agreement damaged.   We are looking with great concern towards the United States,  Gabriel told reporters in Berlin.  We urge the White House not to call into question such an important achievement that has improved our security,  he said in reference to the 2015 accord reached under Trump s predecessor Barack Obama, who sought detente with Tehran.  We are also offering to help influence Iran s behaviour in the region. Germany is ready to do this, but not at the price of sacrificing the nuclear deal.  Trump is expected to  decertify  the landmark agreement between Iran and Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United States and European Union despite advice from senior members of his own cabinet and U.S. partners to stick with it. If he does say Iran is not respecting the deal, the U.S. Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions that were lifted in exchange for curbs on Iran s nuclear programme. Even if Congress does not take that step, the deal could be at risk of unravelling if Washington and Tehran resort to tit-for-tat retaliatory steps. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has repeatedly certified that Iran is in compliance with the deal s terms.  Gabriel called the accord a  great diplomatic success , saying it had prevented Iran from developing nuclear weapons and headed off a military conflict between Iran and Israel.  We are worried, based on the signals coming out of the United States, that the president will tell lawmakers that the nuclear deal with Iran is not being fulfilled,  Gabriel said.  This runs counter to the view of all the European countries that participated in the deal as well as the EU.  Gabriel said he had made clear to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in recent conversations that Europe, due to its relative geographical proximity to Iran, would see its own security interests as damaged if the nuclear deal collapsed.  He also drew attention to the signal such a step would send to North Korea.  Our big concern, with regard to North Korea, is that it is very unlikely that the North Korean dictatorship would sign an international agreement in which it agrees to renounce nuclear weapons when the one agreement like this (with Iran) is being called into question,  Gabriel said.

"Obama: Republicans risk diminishing credibility of Supreme Court WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday said he expected the Senate judiciary committee to hold a hearing for his eventual Supreme Court nominee and said it would be difficult for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to block the process for political reasons. Obama, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, said if Republicans defy their constitutional duties, it would deter the ability of any president to make judicial appointments and would diminish the credibility of the Supreme Court.

"500 Migrants May Have Died in Sinking of Boat in Mediterranean, U.N. Says - The New York Times The United Nations refugee agency said on Wednesday that 500 people may have died in the choppy waters of the Mediterranean last week, when a large boat packed with migrants from Africa and the Middle East capsized in an unknown location between Libya and Italy. If confirmed, it would be the worst humanitarian calamity in Europe’s migrant crisis since more than 800 people died last April near Libyan shores as they tried to reach Italy. The agency based its findings on interviews with 41 survivors of the shipwreck, although it was not able to verify the episode independently. The migrants  —   23 Somalis, 11 Ethiopians, six Egyptians and a Sudanese  —   were picked up by a merchant ship near Greece on April 16 after days of drifting at sea. They were transferred to a migrant camp in Kalamata, a city on the Greek mainland. Their stories helped lift a cloud of confusion about the episode ever since rumors of the sinking emerged over the weekend. But they did not resolve the questions of where the ship went down or what the ultimate death toll may be. No national coast guards have reported finding the boat. If accurate, however, the testimonies suggest that human smugglers are operating as aggressively as ever on the Mediterranean route even as a recent European Union deal with Turkey has stemmed the flow across the Aegean Sea. And while there is no indication that Syrians and others who had been trying to reach Greece are now employing different routes, it is clear that Africans and others remain willing to risk everything to flee repression, poverty and war. A deal that went into effect on March 20 to deport migrants reaching Greece from Turkey has reduced the number of people coming over the Aegean, a perilous voyage that killed around 800 last year. But the policy appears to have prompted smugglers to return to previously abandoned dangerous routes through Libya to Italy  —   the same path used by the 800 migrants who drowned in an overloaded boat a year ago. According to the survivors in Kalamata, a similar situation unfolded late last week, although the exact date was not clear, said William Spindler, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Smugglers had arranged for a   mother ship to leave the Libyan coast and head toward Italy, loaded with “hundreds of people in terribly overcrowded conditions. ” Soon afterward, a second boat about 30 yards long set off from near Tobruk, Libya, with between 100 and 200 people aboard. After several hours, it neared the larger ship, which was waiting somewhere off shore. The smugglers began unloading migrants from the smaller boat onto the larger ship, the survivors told United Nations workers. As people boarded the big boat, it began to list. Then it capsized, spilling passengers into the sea, where most of them drowned amid a panicked frenzy. The survivors included people who had not yet left the smaller vessel, and a handful who managed to swim to it as the larger ship went down. “I could see the bigger boat sinking,” Liban Qadar Jama, a native of Somaliland, was quoted as telling the Voice of America’s Somali Service this week. “We ran with the small boat we were in, as some migrants from the sunk boat desperately swam toward us. We could only save four of them,” he told the V. O. A. In a statement, the refugee agency called for “increased regular pathways for the admission of refugees and asylum seekers to Europe” to “reduce the demand for   and dangerous irregular sea journeys. ” Reports of the sinking emerged over the weekend on Facebook and social media from Somalia. Somalia’s ambassador to Egypt then told BBC Arabic, based on the social media reports, that more than 400 migrants were thought to have drowned. Yet as the stories began to circulate, no one seemed to be able to confirm what had happened, and conflicting narratives have emerged about whether the mass sinking had occurred at all. Social media posts referred to migrant boats running from Egypt to Italy as being caught up in the disaster, although the United Nations said survivors did not confirm that in their accounts. The Somali government issued a statement on Monday stating that 200 to 300 Somalis, including numerous teenagers, appeared to have drowned. But the Greek Coast Guard and the Italian and Maltese rescue authorities denied knowledge of the episode. The International Organization for Migration said on Monday that it could not confirm any news of any deaths or shipwrecks, and the Egyptian Coast Guard and Interior Ministry, which is in charge of the police, said they had heard the news from the media and had no knowledge of any boats leaving Alexandria recently. “There is so much pressure. You have a boat rescuing people in Libya, a boat arriving elsewhere and another sinking in Greece,” said Muhammad Al Kashef, an Egyptian activist working with refugees and migrants in Alexandria. “It just makes it very hard to document things. ” In fact, after nearly 13 hours of calls to Somali activists and community leaders in and out of Egypt, Mr. Kashef said what he was able to ascertain was only that “an unspecified number of people have drowned somewhere near Greece having left from Egypt” Monday morning. “They told me they received calls from the survivors of Monday’s shipwreck in Greece saying their relatives died,” he added. As the rumors spread, European officials rushed to make statements. President Sergio Mattarella of Italy said in Rome on Monday that Europe was looking at “yet another tragedy in the Mediterranean in which, it seems, several hundred people have died. ”",0
"Ivanka Trump to End Fine Jewelry Line in Favor of Mass-Market One - The New York Times Over the last few weeks, it seemed like Neiman Marcus could not make up its mind about whether to sell Ivanka Trump’s fine jewelry. The brand’s baubles disappeared, reappeared and then disappeared again from the department store’s website. But now, Neiman Marcus won’t have much of a choice. Ms. Trump’s brand has discontinued its line of   bracelets, necklaces and rings, the company confirmed on Monday. Instead, it will focus on more affordable fashion jewelry, according to Abigail Klem, the president of Ms. Trump’s brand. In a statement, Ms. Klem attributed the decision to the company’s “commitment to offering   products at accessible price points. ” She did not mention Neiman Marcus, or any of the other retailers that had recently backed away from carrying Ms. Trump’s increasingly politicized products. The decision to discontinue Ms. Trump’s fine jewelry line was reported on Friday by Vanity Fair. Ms. Trump’s shoes, handbags and clothing lines have become targets for both supporters and detractors of her father, President Trump, in his political rise to the White House. Many shoppers have rallied behind Grab Your Wallet, a largely   movement to boycott companies associated with the Trump name. Some companies, like Nordstrom and T. J. Maxx, have pulled back from promoting Ms. Trump’s brand. After the Nordstrom decision, Mr. Trump and one of his top advisers, Kellyanne Conway, spoke out in support of the brand. By some indications, sales of Ms. Trump’s products took off since those comments. “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would say,” Ms. Conway said last month during an interview on Fox News. “I’m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody you can find it online. ” Representatives for Ms. Trump have said that overall sales of her products increased 21 percent in 2016 compared with 2015. In a statement, Ms. Klem said that February this year saw some of the “best performing weeks in the history of the brand. ” Ms. Trump licenses her name to various partners who manufacture her products. The largest share of her revenue comes from sales of her clothing, followed by shoes and handbags. Fine jewelry has always made up a small percentage of her overall business, according to company documents and interviews with former employees. Jewelry, however, was Ms. Trump’s first major foray into licensing her name. She partnered with Moshe Lax, a New   diamond wholesaler, who helped Ms. Trump open a retail location on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 2007. In 2011, her boutique moved to a sprawling store in the city’s SoHo neighborhood. That location, however, was ultimately not profitable enough to stay open and closed in 2015. More recently, Ms. Trump’s fine jewelry has been sold out of a kiosk in the lobby of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. In the fall, Lord  Taylor began selling Ms. Trump’s fashion jewelry, which is the product of a new licensing partnership, according to a spokeswoman for the brand. Unlike her   fine jewelry, items in the fashion jewelry line are aimed at a   audience, with many items priced at under $100. The company projected to make about $300, 000 in royalty fees in 2016, according to company documents from 2014 that were obtained by The New York Times. Sales were expected to reach about $7. 5 million last year. Ms. Trump’s fine jewelry line consisted of diamond bracelets, rings and necklaces that sold for several thousand dollars apiece, like the $10, 800 bangle she wore on CBS’s “60 Minutes” shortly after her father won the presidential election. When journalists received a “style alert” from Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry promoting the item, critics pounced on Ms. Trump, accusing her of using her proximity to the White House to promote her brand. Ms. Klem blamed a “  marketing employee” for the mishap, saying that the company was still figuring out how to move forward appropriately postelection. Ms. Trump still maintains a financial interest in her namesake brand. But since the election, she has taken steps to distance herself from her business interests. Ms. Trump has stepped away from leadership positions at both her brand and at the Trump Organization, where she served as an executive vice president for development and acquisitions along with her two brothers, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. who remain at the company. Ms. Klem was put in charge of the Ivanka Trump company. In addition, Ms. Trump separated her personal and business social media accounts.",0
"The rise of American authoritarianism
 The American media, over the past year, has been trying to work out something of a mystery: Why is the Republican electorate supporting a far-right, orange-toned populist with no real political experience, who espouses extreme and often bizarre views? How has Donald Trump, seemingly out of nowhere, suddenly become so popular?

What's made Trump's rise even more puzzling is that his support seems to cross demographic lines  education, income, age, even religiosity  that usually demarcate candidates. And whereas most Republican candidates might draw strong support from just one segment of the party base, such as Southern evangelicals or coastal moderates, Trump currently does surprisingly well from the Gulf Coast of Florida to the towns of upstate New York, and he won a resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses.

VI. Trump, authoritarians, and fear
VII. America's changing social landscape 
VIII. What authoritarians want 
IX. How authoritarians will change American politics 
Perhaps strangest of all, it wasn't just Trump but his supporters who seemed to have come out of nowhere, suddenly expressing, in large numbers, ideas far more extreme than anything that has risen to such popularity in recent memory. In South Carolina, a CBS News exit poll found that 75 percent of Republican voters supported banning Muslims from the United States. A PPP poll found that a third of Trump voters support banning gays and lesbians from the country. Twenty percent said Lincoln shouldn't have freed the slaves.

Last September, a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst named Matthew MacWilliams realized that his dissertation research might hold the answer to not just one but all three of these mysteries.

MacWilliams studies authoritarianism  not actual dictators, but rather a psychological profile of individual voters that is characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders. People who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear.

So MacWilliams naturally wondered if authoritarianism might correlate with support for Trump.

He polled a large sample of likely voters, looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism. What he found was astonishing: Not only did authoritarianism correlate, but it seemed to predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator. He later repeated the same poll in South Carolina, shortly before the primary there, and found the same results, which he published in Vox:

  
As it turns out, MacWilliams wasn't the only one to have this realization. Miles away, in an office at Vanderbilt University, a professor named Marc Hetherington was having his own aha moment. He realized that he and a fellow political scientist, the University of North Carolina's Jonathan Weiler, had essentially predicted Trump's rise back in 2009, when they discovered something that would turn out to be far more significant than they then realized.

That year, Hetherington and Weiler published a book about the effects of authoritarianism on American politics. Through a series of experiments and careful data analysis, they had come to a surprising conclusion: Much of the polarization dividing American politics was fueled not just by gerrymandering or money in politics or the other oft-cited variables, but by an unnoticed but surprisingly large electoral group  authoritarians.

Their book concluded that the GOP, by positioning itself as the party of traditional values and law and order, had unknowingly attracted what would turn out to be a vast and previously bipartisan population of Americans with authoritarian tendencies.

This trend had been accelerated in recent years by demographic and economic changes such as immigration, which ""activated"" authoritarian tendencies, leading many Americans to seek out a strongman leader who would preserve a status quo they feel is under threat and impose order on a world they perceive as increasingly alien.

Trump embodies the classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive
These Americans with authoritarian views, they found, were sorting into the GOP, driving polarization. But they were also creating a divide within the party, at first latent, between traditional Republican voters and this group whose views were simultaneously less orthodox and, often, more extreme.

Over time, Hetherington and Weiler had predicted, that sorting would become more and more pronounced. And so it was all but inevitable that, eventually, authoritarians would gain enough power within the GOP to make themselves heard.

At the time, even Hetherington and Weiler did not realize the explosive implications: that their theory, when followed to its natural conclusion, predicted a looming and dramatic transformation of American politics. But looking back now, the ramifications of their research seem disturbingly clear.

Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things. And the extreme nature of authoritarians' fears, and of their desire to challenge threats with force, would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics  and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms.

A candidate like Donald Trump.

Even Hetherington was shocked to discover quite how right their theory had been. In the early fall of 2015, as Trump's rise baffled most American journalists and political scientists, he called Weiler. He asked, over and over, ""Can you believe this? Can you believe this?""

This winter, I got in touch with Hetherington, MacWilliams, and several other political scientists who study authoritarianism. I wanted to better understand the theory that seemed to have predicted, with such eerie accuracy, Trump's rise. And, like them, I wanted to find out what the rise of authoritarian politics meant for American politics. Was Trump just the start of something bigger?

These political scientists were, at that moment, beginning to grapple with the same question. We agreed there was something important happening here  that was just beginning to be understood.

Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics
Shortly after the Iowa Republican caucus, in which Trump came in a close second, Vox partnered with the Washington-based media and polling company Morning Consult to test American authoritarians along a range of political and social views  and to test some hypotheses we had developed after speaking with the leading political scientists of the field.

What we found is a phenomenon that explains, with remarkable clarity, the rise of Donald Trump  but that is also much larger than him, shedding new light on some of the biggest political stories of the past decade. Trump, it turns out, is just the symptom. The rise of American authoritarianism is transforming the Republican Party and the dynamics of national politics, with profound consequences likely to extend well beyond this election.

For years now, before anyone thought a person like Donald Trump could possibly lead a presidential primary, a small but respected niche of academic research has been laboring over a question, part political science and part psychology, that had captivated political scientists since the rise of the Nazis.

How do people come to adopt, in such large numbers and so rapidly, extreme political views that seem to coincide with fear of minorities and with the desire for a strongman leader?

To answer that question, these theorists study what they call authoritarianism: not the dictators themselves, but rather the psychological profile of people who, under the right conditions, will desire certain kinds of extreme policies and will seek strongman leaders to implement them.

The political phenomenon we identify as right-wing populism seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed
After an early period of junk science in the mid-20th century, a more serious group of scholars has addressed this question, specifically studying how it plays out in American politics: researchers like Hetherington and Weiler, Stanley Feldman, Karen Stenner, and Elizabeth Suhay, to name just a few.

The field, after a breakthrough in the early 1990s, has come to develop the contours of a grand theory of authoritarianism, culminating quite recently, in 2005, with Stenner's seminal The Authoritarian Dynamic  just in time for that theory to seemingly come true, more rapidly and in greater force than any of them had imagined, in the personage of one Donald Trump and his norm-shattering rise.

According to Stenner's theory, there is a certain subset of people who hold latent authoritarian tendencies. These tendencies can be triggered or ""activated"" by the perception of physical threats or by destabilizing social change, leading those individuals to desire policies and leaders that we might more colloquially call authoritarian.

It is as if, the NYU professor Jonathan Haidt has written, a button is pushed that says, ""In case of moral threat, lock down the borders, kick out those who are different, and punish those who are morally deviant.""

Authoritarians are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump  and will persist as a force in American politics
Authoritarians prioritize social order and hierarchies, which bring a sense of control to a chaotic world. Challenges to that order  diversity, influx of outsiders, breakdown of the old order  are experienced as personally threatening because they risk upending the status quo order they equate with basic security.

This is, after all, a time of social change in America. The country is becoming more diverse, which means that many white Americans are confronting race in a way they have never had to before. Those changes have been happening for a long time, but in recent years they have become more visible and harder to ignore. And they are coinciding with economic trends that have squeezed working-class white people.

When they face physical threats or threats to the status quo, authoritarians support policies that seem to offer protection against those fears. They favor forceful, decisive action against things they perceive as threats. And they flock to political leaders who they believe will bring this action.

If you were to read every word these theorists ever wrote on authoritarians, and then try to design a hypothetical candidate to match their predictions of what would appeal to authoritarian voters, the result would look a lot like Donald Trump.

But political scientists say this theory explains much more than just Donald Trump, placing him within larger trends in American politics: polarization, the rightward shift of the Republican Party, and the rise within that party of a dissident faction challenging GOP orthodoxies and upending American politics.

More than that, authoritarianism reveals the connections between several seemingly disparate stories about American politics. And it suggest that a combination of demographic, economic, and political forces, by awakening this authoritarian class of voters that has coalesced around Trump, have created what is essentially a new political party within the GOP  a phenomenon that broke into public view with the 2016 election but will persist long after it has ended.

II. The discovery: how a niche subfield of political science suddenly became some of the most relevant research in American politics

This study of authoritarianism began shortly after World War II, as political scientists and psychologists in the US and Europe tried to figure out how the Nazis had managed to win such wide public support for such an extreme and hateful ideology.

That was a worthy field of study, but the early work wasn't particularly rigorous by today's standards. The critical theorist Theodor Adorno, for instance, developed what he called the ""F-scale,"" which sought to measure ""fascist"" tendencies. The test wasn't accurate. Sophisticated respondents would quickly discover what the ""right"" answers were and game the test. And there was no proof that the personality type it purportedly measured actually supported fascism.

More than that, this early research seemed to assume that a certain subset of people were inherently evil or dangerous  an idea that Hetherington and Weiler say is simplistic and wrong, and that they resist in their work. (They acknowledge the label ""authoritarians"" doesn't do much to dispel this, but their efforts to replace it with a less pejorative-sounding term were unsuccessful.)

If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump's ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics?
But the real problem for researchers was that even if there really were such a thing as an authoritarian psychological profile, how do you measure it? How do you interrogate authoritarian tendencies, which can sometimes be latent? How do you get honest answers on questions that can be sensitive and highly politicized?

As Hetherington explained to me, ""There are certain things that you just can't ask people directly. You can't ask people, 'Do you not like black people?' You can't ask people if they're bigots.""

For a long time, no one had a solution for this, and the field of study languished.

Then in the early 1990s, a political scientist named Stanley Feldman changed everything. Feldman, a professor at SUNY Stonybrook, believed authoritarianism could be an important factor in American politics in ways that had nothing to do with fascism, but that it could only reliably be measured by unlinking it from specific political preferences.

He realized that if authoritarianism were a personality profile rather than just a political preference, he could get respondents to reveal these tendencies by asking questions about a topic that seemed much less controversial. He settled on something so banal it seems almost laughable: parenting goals.

Feldman developed what has since become widely accepted as the definitive measurement of authoritarianism: four simple questions that appear to ask about parenting but are in fact designed to reveal how highly the respondent values hierarchy, order, and conformity over other values.

Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: independence or respect for elders?
Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: obedience or self-reliance?
Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: to be considerate or to be well-behaved?
Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: curiosity or good manners?
Feldman's test proved to be very reliable. There was now a way to identify people who fit the authoritarian profile, by prizing order and conformity, for example, and desiring the imposition of those values.

In 1992, Feldman convinced the National Election Study, a large survey of American voters conducted in each national election year, to include his four authoritarianism questions. Ever since, political scientists who study authoritarianism have accumulated a wealth of data on who exhibits those tendencies and on how they align with everything from demographic profiles to policy preferences.

What they found was impossible to ignore  and is only just beginning to reshape our understanding of the American electorate.

III. How authoritarianism works

In the early 2000s, as researchers began to make use of the NES data to understand how authoritarianism affected US politics, their work revealed three insights that help explain not just the rise of Trump, but seemingly a half-century of American political dynamics.

The first was Hetherington and Weiler's insight into partisan polarization. In the 1960s, the Republican Party had reinvented itself as the party of law, order, and traditional values  a position that naturally appealed to order- and tradition-focused authoritarians. Over the decades that followed, authoritarians increasingly gravitated toward the GOP, where their concentration gave them more and more influence over time.

The second was Stenner's theory of ""activation."" In an influential 2005 book called The Authoritarian Dynamic, Stenner argued that many authoritarians might be latent  that they might not necessarily support authoritarian leaders or policies until their authoritarianism had been ""activated.""

The social threat theory helps explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same-sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them
This activation could come from feeling threatened by social changes such as evolving social norms or increasing diversity, or any other change that they believe will profoundly alter the social order they want to protect. In response, previously more moderate individuals would come to support leaders and policies we might now call Trump-esque.

Other researchers, like Hetherington, take a slightly different view. They believe that authoritarians aren't ""activated""  they've always held their authoritarian preferences  but that they only come to express those preferences once they feel threatened by social change or some kind of threat from outsiders.

But both schools of thought agree on the basic causality of authoritarianism. People do not support extreme policies and strongman leaders just out of an affirmative desire for authoritarianism, but rather as a response to experiencing certain kinds of threats.

The third insight came from Hetherington and American University professor Elizabeth Suhay, who found that when non-authoritarians feel sufficiently scared, they also start to behave, politically, like authoritarians.

But Hetherington and Suhay found a distinction between physical threats such as terrorism, which could lead non-authoritarians to behave like authoritarians, and more abstract social threats, such as eroding social norms or demographic changes, which do not have that effect. That distinction would turn out to be important, but it also meant that in times when many Americans perceived imminent physical threats, the population of authoritarians could seem to swell rapidly.

Together, those three insights added up to one terrifying theory: that if social change and physical threats coincided at the same time, it could awaken a potentially enormous population of American authoritarians, who would demand a strongman leader and the extreme policies necessary, in their view, to meet the rising threats.

This theory would seem to predict the rise of an American political constituency that looks an awful lot like the support base that has emerged, seemingly out of nowhere, to propel Donald Trump from sideshow loser of the 2012 GOP primary to runaway frontrunner in 2016.

Beyond being almost alarmingly prescient, this theory speaks to an oft-stated concern about Trump: that what's scariest is not the candidate, but rather the extent and fervor of his support.

And it raises a question: If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump's ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics? And what effect could it have even after the 2016 race has ended?

IV. What can authoritarianism explain?

In early February, shortly after Trump finished second in the Iowa caucus and ended any doubts about his support, I began talking to Feldman, Hetherington, and MacWilliams to try to answer these questions.

MacWilliams had already demonstrated a link between authoritarianism and support for Trump. But we wanted to know how else authoritarianism was playing out in American life, from policy positions to party politics to social issues, and what it might mean for America's future.

It was time to call Kyle Dropp. Dropp is a political scientist and pollster whom one of my colleagues described as ""the Doogie Howser of polling."" He does indeed appear jarringly young for a Dartmouth professor. But he is also the co-founder of a media and polling company, Morning Consult, that had worked with Vox on several other projects.

When we approached Morning Consult, Dropp and his colleagues were excited. Dropp was familiar with Hetherington's work and the authoritarianism measure, he said, and was instantly intrigued by how we could test its relevance to the election. Hetherington and the other political scientists were, in turn, eager to more fully explore the theories that had suddenly become much more relevant.

Non-authoritarians who were sufficiently frightened of threats like terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians
We put together five sets of questions. The first set, of course, was the test for authoritarianism that Feldman had developed. This would allow us to measure how authoritarianism coincided or didn't with our other sets of questions.

The second set asked standard election-season questions on preferred candidates and party affiliation.

The third set tested voters' fears of a series of physical threats, ranging from ISIS and Russia to viruses and car accidents.

The fourth set tested policy preferences, in an attempt to see how authoritarianism might lead voters to support particular policies.

If the research were right, then we'd expect people who scored highly on authoritarianism to express outsize fear of ""outsider"" threats such as ISIS or foreign governments versus other threats. We also expected that non-authoritarians who expressed high levels of fear would be more likely to support Trump. This would speak to physical fears as triggering a kind of authoritarian upsurge, which would in turn lead to Trump support.

We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election
The final set of questions was intended to test fear of social change. We asked people to rate a series of social changes  both actual and hypothetical  on a scale of ""very good"" to ""very bad"" for the country. These included same-sex marriage, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and American Muslims building more mosques in US cities.

If the theory about social change provoking stress amongst authoritarians turned out to be correct, then authoritarians would be more likely to rate the changes as bad for the country.

In the aggregate, we were hoping to do a few things. We wanted to understand who these people are, in simple demographic terms, and to test the basic hypotheses about how authoritarianism, in theory, is supposed to work. We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election: Were they driving certain policy positions, for example?

We wanted to better understand the larger forces that had suddenly made authoritarians so numerous and so extreme  was it migration, terrorism, perhaps the decline of working-class whites? And maybe most of all, we wanted to develop some theories about what the rise of American authoritarianism meant for the future of polarization between the parties as well as a Republican Party that had become both more extreme and internally divided.

About 10 days later, shortly after Trump won the New Hampshire primary, the poll went into the field. In less than two weeks, we had our results.

V. How the GOP became the party of authoritarians

The first thing that jumped out from the data on authoritarians is just how many there are. Our results found that 44 percent of white respondents nationwide scored as ""high"" or ""very high"" authoritarians, with 19 percent as ""very high."" That's actually not unusual, and lines up with previous national surveys that found that the authoritarian disposition is far from rare1.

The key thing to understand is that authoritarianism is often latent; people in this 44 percent only vote or otherwise act as authoritarians once triggered by some perceived threat, physical or social. But that latency is part of how, over the past few decades, authoritarians have quietly become a powerful political constituency without anyone realizing it.

Today, according to our survey, authoritarians skew heavily Republican. More than 65 percent of people who scored highest on the authoritarianism questions were GOP voters. More than 55 percent of surveyed Republicans scored as ""high"" or ""very high"" authoritarians.

And at the other end of the scale, that pattern reversed. People whose scores were most non-authoritarian  meaning they always chose the non-authoritarian parenting answer  were almost 75 percent Democrats.

But this hasn't always been the case. According to Hetherington and Weiler's research, this is not a story about how Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Venus. It's a story of polarization that increased over time.

They trace the trend to the 1960s, when the Republican Party shifted electoral strategies to try to win disaffected Southern Democrats, in part by speaking to fears of changing social norms  for example, the racial hierarchies upset by civil rights. The GOP also embraced a ""law and order"" platform with a heavily racial appeal to white voters who were concerned about race riots.

This positioned the GOP as the party of traditional values and social structures  a role that it has maintained ever since. That promise to stave off social change and, if necessary, to impose order happened to speak powerfully to voters with authoritarian inclinations.

Democrats, by contrast, have positioned themselves as the party of civil rights, equality, and social progress  in other words, as the party of social change, a position that not only fails to attract but actively repels change-averse authoritarians.

Over the next several decades, Hetherington explained to me, this led authoritarians to naturally ""sort"" themselves into the Republican Party.

That matters, because as more authoritarians sort themselves into the GOP, they have more influence over its policies and candidates. It is not for nothing that our poll found that more than half of the Republican respondents score as authoritarian.

Perhaps more importantly, the party has less and less ability to ignore authoritarians' voting preferences  even if those preferences clash with the mainstream party establishment.

VI. Trump, authoritarians, and fear
  
Based on our data, Morning Consult data scientist Adam Petrihos said that ""among Republicans, very high/high authoritarianism is very predictive of support for Trump."" Trump has 42 percent support among Republicans but, according to our survey, a full 52 percent support among very high authoritarians.

Authoritarianism was the best single predictor of support for Trump, although having a high school education also came close. And as Hetherington noted after reviewing our results, the relationship between authoritarianism and Trump support remained robust, even after controlling for education level and gender.

Trump support was much lower among Republicans who scored low on authoritarianism: only 38 percent.

But that's still awfully high. So what could explain Trump's support among non-authoritarians?

I suspected the answer might lie at least partly in Hetherington and Suhay's research on how fear affects non-authoritarian voters, so I called them to discuss the data. Hetherington crunched some numbers on physical threats and noticed two things.

The first was that authoritarians tend to fear very specific kinds of physical threats.


Authoritarians, we found in our survey, tend to most fear threats that come from abroad, such as ISIS or Russia or Iran. These are threats, the researchers point out, to which people can put a face; a scary terrorist or an Iranian ayatollah. Non-authoritarians were much less afraid of those threats. For instance, 73 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians believed that terrorist organizations like ISIS posed a ""very high risk"" to them, but only 45 percent of very low-scoring authoritarians did. Domestic threats like car accidents, by contrast, were much less frightening to authoritarians.

But Hetherington also noticed something else: A subgroup of non-authoritarians were very afraid of threats like Iran or ISIS. And the more fear of these threats they expressed, the more likely they were to support Trump.

  
This seemed to confirm his and Suhay's theory: that non-authoritarians who are sufficiently frightened of physical threats such as terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians.

That's important, because for years now, Republican politicians and Republican-leaning media such as Fox News have been telling viewers nonstop that the world is a terrifying place and that President Obama isn't doing enough to keep Americans safe.

There are a variety of political and media incentives for why this happens. But the point is that, as a result, Republican voters have been continually exposed to messages warning of physical dangers. As the perception of physical threat has risen, this fear appears to have led a number of non-authoritarians to vote like authoritarians  to support Trump.

An irony of this primary is that the Republican establishment has tried to stop Trump by, among other things, co-opting his message. But when establishment candidates such as Marco Rubio try to match Trump's rhetoric on ISIS or on American Muslims, they may end up deepening the fear that can only lead voters back to Trump.

VII. Is America's changing social landscape ""activating"" authoritarianism?
But the research on authoritarianism suggests it's not just physical threats driving all this. There should be another kind of threat  larger, slower, less obvious, but potentially even more powerful  pushing authoritarians to these extremes: the threat of social change.

This could come in the form of evolving social norms, such as the erosion of traditional gender roles or evolving standards in how to discuss sexual orientation. It could come in the form of rising diversity, whether that means demographic changes from immigration or merely changes in the colors of the faces on TV. Or it could be any changes, political or economic, that disrupt social hierarchies.

What these changes have in common is that, to authoritarians, they threaten to take away the status quo as they know it  familiar, orderly, secure  and replace it with something that feels scary because it is different and destabilizing, but also sometimes because it upends their own place in society. According to the literature, authoritarians will seek, in response, a strong leader who promises to suppress the scary changes, if necessary by force, and to preserve the status quo.

This is why, in our survey, we wanted to study the degree to which authoritarians versus non-authoritarians expressed a fear of social change  and whether this, as expected, led them to desire heavy-handed responses.

  
Our results seemed to confirm this: Authoritarians were significantly more likely to rate almost all of the actual and hypothetical social issues we asked about as ""bad"" or ""very bad"" for the country.

For instance, our results suggested that an astonishing 44 percent of authoritarians believe same-sex marriage is harmful to the country. Twenty-eight percent rated same-sex marriage as ""very bad"" for America, and another 16 percent said that its ""bad."" Only about 35 percent of high-scoring authoritarians said same-sex marriage was ""good"" or ""very good"" for the country.

Tellingly, non-authoritarians' responses skewed in the opposite direction. Non-authoritarians tended to rate same-sex marriage as ""good"" or ""very good"" for the country.

The fact that authoritarians and non-authoritarians split over something as seemingly personal and nonthreatening as same-sex marriage is crucial for understanding how authoritarianism can be triggered by even a social change as minor as expanding marriage rights.

We also asked respondents to rate whether Muslims building more mosques in American cities was a good thing. This was intended to test respondents' comfort level with sharing their communities with Muslims  an issue that has been particularly contentious this primary election.

  
A whopping 56.5 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians said it was either ""bad"" or ""very bad"" for the country when Muslims built more mosques. Only 14 percent of that group said more mosques would be ""good"" or ""very good.""

The literature on authoritarianism suggests this is not just simple Islamophobia, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon wherein authoritarians feel threatened by people they identify as ""outsiders"" and by the possibility of changes to the status quo makeup of their communities.

This would help explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same-sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them. What these seemingly disparate groups have in common is the perceived threat they pose to the status quo order, which authoritarians experience as a threat to themselves.

And America is at a point when the status quo social order is changing rapidly; when several social changes are converging. And they are converging especially on working-class white people.

It is conventional wisdom to ascribe the rise of first the Tea Party right and now Trump to the notion that working-class white Americans are angry.

Indeed they are, but this data helps explain that they are also under certain demographic and economic pressures that, according to this research, are highly likely to trigger authoritarianism  and thus suggests there is something a little more complex going on than simple ""anger"" that helps explain their gravitation toward extreme political responses.

Working-class communities have come under tremendous economic strain since the recession. And white people are also facing the loss of the privileged position that they previously were able to take for granted. Whites are now projected to become a minority group over the next few decades, owing to migration and other factors. The president is a black man, and nonwhite faces are growing more common in popular culture. Nonwhite groups are raising increasingly prominent political demands, and often those demands coincide with issues such as policing that also speak to authoritarian concerns.

Some of these factors might be considered more or less legitimately threatening than others  the loss of working-class jobs in this country is a real and important issue, no matter how one feels about fading white privilege  but that is not the point.

The point, rather, is that the increasingly important political phenomenon we identify as right-wing populism, or white working-class populism, seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed.

That is not to dismiss white working-class concerns as invalid because they might be expressed by authoritarians or through authoritarian politics, but rather to better understand why this is happening  and why it's having such a profound and extreme effect on American politics.

Have we misunderstood hard-line social conservatism all along?
Most of the other social-threat questions followed a similar pattern2. On its surface, this might seem to suggest that authoritarianism is just a proxy for especially hard-line manifestations of social conservatism. But when examined more carefully, it suggests something more interesting about the nature of social conservatism itself.

For liberals, it may be easy to conclude that opposition to things like same-sex marriage, immigration, and diversity is rooted in bigotry against those groups  that it's the manifestation of specific homophobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.

But the results of the Vox/Morning Consult poll, along with prior research on authoritarianism, suggests there might be something else going on.

There is no particular reason, after all, why parenting goals should coincide with animus against specific groups. We weren't asking questions about whether it was important for children to respect people of different races, but about whether they should respect authority and rules generally. So why do they coincide so heavily?

What might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner's theory of ""activation""
What is most likely, Hetherington suggested, is that authoritarians are much more susceptible to messages that tell them to fear a specific ""other""  whether or not they have a preexisting animus against that group. Those fears would therefore change over time as events made different groups seem more or less threatening.

It all depends, he said, on whether a particular group of people has been made into an outgroup or not  whether they had been identified as a dangerous other.

Since September 2001, some media outlets and politicians have painted Muslims as the other and as dangerous to America. Authoritarians, by nature, are more susceptible to these messages, and thus more likely to come to oppose the presence of mosques in their communities.

When told to fear a particular outgroup, Hetherington said, ""On average people who score low in authoritarianism will be like, 'Im not that worried about that,' while people who score high in authoritarianism will be like, 'Oh, my god! Im worried about that, because the world is a dangerous place.'""

In other words, what might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner's theory of ""activation"": that authoritarians are unusually susceptible to messages about the ways outsiders and social changes threaten America, and so lash out at groups that are identified as objects of concern at that given moment.

That's not to say that such an attitude is in some way better than simple racism or xenophobia  it is still dangerous and damaging, especially if it empowers frightening demagogues like Donald Trump.

Perhaps more to the point, it helps explain how Trump's supporters have come to so quickly embrace such extreme policies targeting these outgroups: mass deportation of millions of people, a ban on foreign Muslims visiting the US. When you think about those policy preferences as driven by authoritarianism, in which social threats are perceived as especially dangerous and as demanding extreme responses, rather than the sudden emergence of specific bigotries, this starts to make a lot more sense.

VIII. What authoritarians want
From our parenting questions, we learned who the GOP authoritarians are. From our questions about threats and social change, we learned what's motivating them. But the final set of questions, on policy preferences, might be the most important of all: So what? What do authoritarians actually want?

The responses to our policy questions showed that authoritarians have their own set of policy preferences, distinct from GOP orthodoxy. And those preferences mean that, in real and important ways, authoritarians are their own distinct constituency: effectively a new political party within the GOP.

What stands out from the results, Feldman wrote after reviewing our data, is that authoritarians ""are most willing to want to use force, to crack down on immigration, and limit civil liberties.""

This ""action side"" of authoritarianism, he believed, was the key thing that distinguished Trump supporters from supporters of other GOP candidates. ""The willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats  that is most clear among Trump supporters.""

Authoritarians generally and Trump voters specifically, we found, were highly likely to support five policies:

Using military force over diplomacy against countries that threaten the United States
Changing the Constitution to bar citizenship for children of illegal immigrants
Imposing extra airport checks on passengers who appear to be of Middle Eastern descent in order to curb terrorism
Requiring all citizens to carry a national ID card at all times to show to a police officer on request, to curb terrorism
Allowing the federal government to scan all phone calls for calls to any number linked to terrorism
What these policies share in common is an outsize fear of threats, physical and social, and, more than that, a desire to meet those threats with severe government action  with policies that are authoritarian not just in style but in actuality. The scale of the desired response is, in some ways, what most distinguishes authoritarians from the rest of the GOP.

""Many Republicans seem to be threatened by terrorism, violence, and cultural diversity, but that's not unique to Trump supporters,"" Feldman told me.

""It seems to be the action side of authoritarianism  the willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats  that is most clear among Trump supporters,"" he added.

If Trump loses the election, that won't remove the threats and social changes that trigger the ""action side"" of authoritarianism
This helps explain why the GOP has had such a hard time co-opting Trump's supporters, even though those supporters' immediate policy concerns, such as limiting immigration or protecting national security, line up with party orthodoxy. The real divide is over how far to go in responding. And the party establishment is simply unwilling to call for such explicitly authoritarian policies.

Just as striking is what was missing from authoritarians' concerns. There was no clear correlation between authoritarianism and support for tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 per year, for example. And the same was true of support for international trade agreements.

These are both issues associated with mainstream GOP economic policies. All groups opposed the tax cuts, and support for trade agreements was evenly lukewarm across all degrees of authoritarianism. So there is no real divide on these issues.

But there is one more factor that our data couldn't capture but is nevertheless important: Trump's style.

Trump's specific policies aren't the thing that most sets him apart from the rest of the field of GOP candidates. Rather, it's his rhetoric and style. The way he reduces everything to black-and-white extremes of strong versus weak, greatest versus worst. His simple, direct promises that he can solve problems that other politicians are too weak to manage.

And, perhaps most importantly, his willingness to flout all the conventions of civilized discourse when it comes to the minority groups that authoritarians find so threatening. That's why it's a benefit rather than a liability for Trump when he says Mexicans are rapists or speaks gleefully of massacring Muslims with pig-blood-tainted bullets: He is sending a signal to his authoritarian supporters that he won't let ""political correctness"" hold him back from attacking the outgroups they fear.

This, Feldman explained to me, is ""classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive.""

IX. How authoritarians will change the GOP  and American politics

To my surprise, the most compelling conclusion to come out of our polling data wasn't about Trump at all.

Rather, it was that authoritarians, as a growing presence in the GOP, are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump  and will persist as a force in American politics regardless of the fate of his candidacy.

If Trump loses the election, that will not remove the threats and social changes that trigger the ""action side"" of authoritarianism. The authoritarians will still be there. They will still look for candidates who will give them the strong, punitive leadership they desire.

And that means Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics, with potentially profound implications for the country.

It would also mean more problems for the GOP. This election is already showing that the party establishment abhors Trump and all he stands for  his showy demagoguery, his disregard for core conservative economic values, his divisiveness.

We may now have a de facto three-party system: the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians
But while the party may try to match Trump's authoritarian rhetoric, and its candidates may grudgingly embrace some of his harsher policies toward immigrants or Muslims, in the end a mainstream political party cannot fully commit to extreme authoritarian action the way Trump can.

That will be a problem for the party. Just look at where the Tea Party has left the Republican establishment. The Tea Party delivered the House to the GOP in 2010, but ultimately left the party in an unresolved civil war. Tea Party candidates have challenged moderates and centrists, leaving the GOP caucus divided and chaotic.

Now a similar divide is playing out at the presidential level, with results that are even more destructive for the Republican Party. Authoritarians may be a slight majority within the GOP, and thus able to force their will within the party, but they are too few and their views too unpopular to win a national election on their own.

And so the rise of authoritarianism as a force within American politics means we may now have a de facto three-party system: the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians.

And although the latter two groups are presently forced into an awkward coalition, the GOP establishment has demonstrated a complete inability to regain control over the renegade authoritarians, and the authoritarians are actively opposed to the establishment's centrist goals and uninterested in its economic platform.

Over time, this will have significant political consequences for the Republican Party. It will become more difficult for Republican candidates to win the presidency because the candidates who can win the nomination by appealing to authoritarian primary voters will struggle to court mainstream voters in the general election. They will have less trouble with local and congressional elections, but that might just mean more legislative gridlock as the GOP caucus struggles to balance the demands of authoritarian and mainstream legislators. The authoritarian base will drag the party further to the right on social issues, and will simultaneously erode support for traditionally conservative economic policies.

And in the meantime, the forces activating American authoritarians seem likely to only grow stronger. Norms around gender, sexuality, and race will continue evolving. Movements like Black Lives Matter will continue chipping away at the country's legacy of institutionalized discrimination, pursuing the kind of social change and reordering of society that authoritarians find so threatening.

The chaos in the Middle East, which allows groups like ISIS to flourish and sends millions of refugees spilling into other countries, shows no sign of improving. Longer term, if current demographic trends continue, white Americans will cease to be a majority over the coming decades.

In the long run, this could mean a GOP that is even more hard-line on immigration and on policing, that is more outspoken about fearing Muslims and other minority groups, but also takes a softer line on traditional party economic issues like tax cuts. It will be a GOP that continues to perform well in congressional and local elections, but whose divisions leave the party caucus divided to the point of barely functioning, and perhaps eventually unable to win the White House.

For decades, the Republican Party has been winning over authoritarians by implicitly promising to stand firm against the tide of social change, and to be the party of force and power rather than the party of negotiation and compromise. But now it may be discovering that its strategy has worked too well  and threatens to tear the party apart.",0
"More than 400 U.S. troops leaving Syria: coalition WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 400 U.S. Marines and their artillery are leaving Syria after helping to capture the city of Raqqa from Islamic State, the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militant group said on Thursday.  Last month, U.S.-backed militias declared victory in Raqqa, Islamic State s former headquarters in Syria, after months of fighting with the help of the U.S.-led coalition.  With the city liberated and ISIS on the run, the unit has been ordered home. Its replacements have been called off,  the coalition said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State.  We re drawing down combat forces where it makes sense, but still continuing our efforts to help Syrian and Iraqi partners maintain security,  Brigadier General Jonathan Braga, the director of operations for the coalition, said in the statement.  Our remaining forces will continue to work by, with, and through partner forces to defeat remaining ISIS, prevent a re-emergence of ISIS, and set conditions for international governments and NGOs to help local citizens recover from the horrors of ISIS  short-lived rule,  he said. Officially, the Pentagon says there are 503 troops in Syria. However, as of last week, U.S. officials said there were closer to 2,000 U.S. troops in the country. The latest announcement would reduce that number. As that campaign against Islamic State winds down, it is unclear how many, if any, U.S. troops will remain in Syria. Most of them are special operations forces, working to train and advise local partner forces, including providing artillery support against Islamic State militants. Separately, Russia said it was already preparing to withdraw its military contingent from Syria, Russian news agencies reported. ",0
"Germany's FDP look to fill Schaeuble's big shoes BERLIN (Reuters) - Wolfgang Schaeuble s decision to step aside as German finance minister has given the Free Democratic Party what it has long craved: the chance to shape policy from the most coveted perch in Chancellor Angela Merkel s next coalition government. However the opportunity also presents the party with a conundrum. FDP leader Christian Lindner has signaled for months that he would prefer to lead the business-friendly party in parliament rather than take a cabinet job under Merkel. If Lindner sticks to his stance then the FDP, which is returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus, must find someone else to fill one of the most important positions in international economic and financial policy. The person who replaces Schaeuble could also carry the prestigious title of vice chancellor.  The only party member besides Lindner with that kind of stature is Wolfgang Kubicki, whose political skills are unquestioned but who is also known as a loose cannon, a reputation that may not suit a sensitive job where a few ill-judged words can move global financial markets.  If it is not Lindner, then there are not a lot of options,  said one senior figure in the party.  Kubicki might be the only one with the profile and political weight.  The finance ministry seems to be the FDP s for the taking. As the second biggest party in what is expected to be a three-way coalition with Merkel s conservatives and the Greens, it would have first choice of cabinet post. The post has become more influential over the past decade as Germany, the world s fourth largest economy, navigated the global financial crisis and euro zone turmoil. Schaeuble, who is becoming president of the parliament, was known for his budget discipline and tough stance toward struggling euro partners like Greece. Whoever replaces him will play a crucial role in shaping Germany s response to calls from French President Emmanuel Macron for an ambitious overhaul of the EU and euro zone.  The finance ministry will be absolutely crucial in the next government in shaping not just Germany s fiscal stance but the future of Europe,  said Jens Boysen-Hogrefe of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. No one besides Lindner deserves more credit for the FDP s revival after its disastrous 2013 election result than the 65-year-old Kubicki, a quick-witted lawyer who sails around on his yacht  Liberty  and is known as one of the most outspoken, colorful figures in German politics. Earlier this year, after Donald Trump announced his travel ban on seven mainly Muslim countries, Kubicki said Berlin should retaliate by barring the U.S. president from entering Germany. He has made clear in the past that he is interested in the finance job. In a 2010 interview with newspaper Die Zeit, he said it was the only position that might lure him from his home in the port of Kiel in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.  Only one post would interest me, finance minister,  Kubicki said at the time.  Finance minister is the key job, and I would like to prove that budget consolidation can work.  Asked on Friday by German daily Handelsblatt whether he wanted the job, Kubicki dodged the question, saying policy was more important than cabinet posts.   But the interview with Die Zeit showed why the party, and Merkel, might have second thoughts. Explaining why he hadn t yet made a move to Berlin, Kubicki told the paper that if he did, he could turn into a  drinker  and  possibly also a whoremonger . He then painted a hedonistic picture of political life in Berlin, replete with alcohol-soaked receptions and trysts with random women. When asked about these comments today, Kubicki who is married to his third wife, says he has become  ethically and morally centered  in the intervening years.  The names of other FDP politicians are circulating as potential finance ministers. They include Werner Hoyer, president of the European Investment Bank (EIB); Carl-Ludwig Thiele of the Bundesbank; Volker Wissing, the former head of the Bundestag finance committee; and Otto Fricke, former head of the budget committee. Two members of the European Parliament, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff and Michael Theurer, have also been mentioned. One cannot completely rule out that Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) will keep the post. If they do, Peter Altmaier, who is expected to replace Schaeuble until the new government is formed, could be a favorite. However, the scenario that several politicians in Berlin said was most likely is that Lindner will be compelled to take the finance ministry, with Kubicki sliding in as parliamentary leader, which is seen as a role more suited to his strengths. Having Lindner, the face of the FDP, outside the government would be frowned upon by Merkel, who will be trying to hold together an unwieldy coalition with the FDP and Greens, a combination that has never been tried at the federal level. There are big differences between the FDP and Greens on economic, environmental and European policy. Add in Merkel s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which is pushing a hard line on immigration, and it is hard to see how the parties will bridge some policy gaps and hold together. Regardless of who takes the job, big changes in fiscal policy are seen as unlikely. The FDP has called for 30 billion euros in tax cuts, but it is unlikely to get its way in the coalition talks and it remains committed to the  Schwarze Null  balanced budget that Schaeuble defended.  You might see new impulses with an FDP finance minister,  said Boysen-Hogrefe of the Kiel institute.  But don t count on big changes. The Schwarze Null will remain a priority.   ",0
"Oil business seen in strong position as Trump tackles tax reform  (This January 3 story was corrected to remove reference in paragraph 8 to ConocoPhillips, which is not an integrated oil company) By David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices.    Trump’s emerging leadership includes Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector.  And in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs. House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits.  But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost U.S. manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports. Because U.S. oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc could also be hit, depending on whether they are net importers.   But the industry’s allies would likely move to soften any rough edges, analysts say.  “I don’t see this mix of leadership figures in the House, Senate and the White House, doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices,” said Peter Cohn, an energy analyst with Height Securities, a Washington-based investment firm. The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries, including retailers and automakers, which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income. Such a knock-on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade.      “We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully,” Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, said in a statement. Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and “listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out.” Moreover, some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs, saying the dollar’s value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports. Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude, they predict. “This argument by the oil industry is, frankly, all wrong,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who now heads the American Action Forum think tank. “Refiners are going to be basically held harmless. They’ll have a lower dollar price of oil. Net cost is the same. And they go about their business. I’m unsympathetic,” he added. Height Securities’ Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers: “Trump doesn’t want to have refineries closing on his watch.”  Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan. But they stand to gain more than they will lose. For instance, an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent. Under the congressional Republicans’ plan, the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent; under Trump’s plan, to 15 percent. Similarly, companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments.  Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries. Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether, while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate. ",0
"Why Are So Many People Popping Vitamin D? - The New York Times There was no reason for the patients to receive vitamin D tests. They did not have osteoporosis their bones were not cracking from a lack of the vitamin. They did not have diseases that interfere with vitamin D absorption. Yet in a recent sample of 800, 000 patients in Maine, nearly one in five had had at least one test for blood levels of the vitamin over a   period. More than a third got two or more tests, often to evaluate such   complaints as malaise or fatigue. The researchers who gathered the data, Dr. Kathleen Fairfield and Kim Murray of the Maine Medical Center, were surprised. Perhaps they shouldn’t have been. Millions of people are popping supplements in the belief that vitamin D can help turn back depression, fatigue, muscle weakness, even heart disease or cancer. In fact, there has never been widely accepted evidence that vitamin D is helpful in preventing or treating any of those conditions. But so firm is this belief that vitamin D has become popular even among people with no particular medical complaints or disease risks. And they are being tested for vitamin D “deficiency” in ever greater numbers. The number of blood tests for vitamin D levels among Medicare beneficiaries, mostly people 65 and older, increased   from 2000 to 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among patients with commercial insurance, testing rates rose 2.  from 2009 to 2014. Labs performing these tests are reporting perfectly normal levels of vitamin D  —   20 to 30 nanograms per milliliter of blood  —   as “insufficient. ” As a consequence, millions of healthy people think they have a deficiency, and some are taking supplemental doses so high they can be dangerous, causing poor appetite, nausea and vomiting. Vitamin D overdoses also can lead to weakness, frequent urination and kidney problems. “A lot of clinicians are acting like there is a pandemic” of vitamin D deficiency, said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, a preventive medicine researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who helped write an Institute of Medicine report on vitamin D. “That gives them justification to screen everyone and get everyone well above what the Institute of Medicine recommends. ” In fact, the institute committee on which Dr. Manson served concluded in 2010 that very few people were vitamin D deficient and noted that randomized trials had found no particular benefit for healthy people to have blood levels above 20 nanograms per milliliter. Medical organizations, too, have repeatedly found that there is no reason to assess vitamin D levels in healthy adults, and recently two rigorous studies failed to find that high doses of the vitamin protect against heart disease or cancer. Still, vitamin D has become “a religion,” said Dr. Clifford J. Rosen, an osteoporosis researcher at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute and a member of the Institute of Medicine’s committee. Vitamin D is a   nutrient needed to absorb calcium and phosphorus, and therefore to make bones strong. People do not make their own: We need sunlight to synthesize vitamin D. The vitamin also is found in oily fish and in a few other foods, including milk, which is fortified with the vitamin. Because many people have little exposure to sunlight, especially those living in northern climates in winter, some investigators became concerned more than a decade ago that large swaths of the population were not getting enough vitamin D. One is Dr. Michael F. Holick, a professor of medicine, physiology and biophysics at Boston University School of Medicine and a leading proponent of the idea that just about everyone needs a vitamin D supplement. He points to studies that suggest an association between low vitamin D levels and higher rates of various diseases. While these observational reports do not prove cause and effect, he is persuaded by the fact that many point in the same direction, hinting that low blood levels of vitamin D are hazardous. Doctors, he believes, must take action. The recommended daily allowance is 600 international units up to age 70, and 800 I. U. for people who are older, Dr. Holick said. Diet cannot provide that much of the vitamin, he notes. And it would require nearly constant exposure to sunlight to reach the levels he recommends. Over the years, he acknowledged, studies in which people were randomly assigned to take a vitamin D pill or a placebo have failed to support claims for the vitamin’s benefits. But those studies tended to be too small to be definitive, he said. Yet recent trials, larger and more rigorous, also have not produced the   results. One study with 5, 108 participants, published this month in JAMA Cardiology, found that vitamin D did not prevent heart attacks. Another study, published at the end of March, included 2, 303 healthy postmenopausal women randomly assigned to take vitamin D and calcium supplements or a placebo. The supplements did not protect the women against cancer, the researchers concluded. Other, more ambitious studies are underway, including a   randomized study of almost 26, 000 healthy men and women directed by Dr. Manson and Julie Buring, who hope to answer once and for all whether taking vitamin D can prevent cancer, heart disease and strokes. The frenzy for vitamin D began not in natural food stores but in medical journals. Beginning around 2000, a series of research papers linked vitamin D levels that are lower, but considered normal, to multiple sclerosis and mental illness, then to cancer risk and bone health. Blood testing for the vitamin took off. “Patients began asking for it,” said Dr. Fairfield, the researcher in Maine. “A lot of people thought that if they were fatigued or sad or they did not feel well, they might be vitamin D deficient. ” In 2007, Dr. Holick published a paper in The New England Journal of Medicine asserting that vitamin D levels now considered normal  —   21 to 29 nanograms per milliliter of blood  —   were linked to an increased risk of cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, schizophrenia, depression, poor lung capacity and wheezing. He also published books promoting the idea that vitamin D levels in that range were insufficient to promote good health. In 2011, a committee of the Endocrine Society, headed by Dr. Holick, came out with a recommendation that vitamin D levels be at least 30 nanograms per milliliter, which meant that most people were vitamin D deficient. The group recommended the taking of supplements but not widespread testing, on the grounds that this would not be  . The new guideline had an immediate effect: Commercial labs began describing levels of 20 to 30 nanograms per milliliter as insufficient. Many continue to do so today. “There was a vitamin D bandwagon,” said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, an osteoporosis expert at the Mayo Clinic. Vitamin D tests “became incorporated into the general evaluation of patients,” he added. Ravinder J. Singh, who runs a testing lab at the Mayo Clinic, was taken aback by the sudden deluge. “Demand for vitamin D testing went through the sky,” he said. “It was almost as though there was nothing else serious in clinical practice. ” Dr. Fairfield, like many other general practitioners, began testing patients, trying to make sure they raised their vitamin D levels above 29 and became concerned that she and other doctors had been too cavalier about the vitamin. “We were worried that there was a lot we were missing,” she said. But when the Institute of Medicine report proved critical of the vitamin D craze, she started telling healthy patients there was no reason for them to be tested. Many did not want to hear that advice. “People were used to vitamin D monitoring, like with cholesterol,” Dr. Fairfield said. “They wanted to know what their number is. ” Although Dr. Fairfield stopped routine vitamin D testing, many others have not. Becky Rosen, 64, a nurse who is director of clinical services at a home health agency in Brunswick, Me. had a physical exam four years ago and was told she needed a vitamin D test. She declined. Her next physical exam was in February, with a different doctor. Once again, the doctor wanted to test her vitamin D level. “I said, ‘I don’t think I need it,’” Ms. Rosen said. The doctor persisted, explaining that Maine is so far north that people may not be exposed to much sunlight. Once again, Ms. Rosen politely but firmly declined. But she is a special patient: Her husband, Dr. Rosen, helped write the Institute of Medicine report that was critical of vitamin D supplements. “I can see other people getting persuaded,” Ms. Rosen said.",0
"In the battle for Hollywood endorsements - and cash - Clinton rules LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ positions on fracking, free tuition and breaking up big banks wouldn’t sound out of place in an Oscar winning-actor’s acceptance speech.  But in famously liberal Hollywood, long used as an ATM by Democratic campaigns, Sanders’ message is not resonating as loudly as in other progressive bastions. The more moderate Hillary Clinton has far outpaced the Vermont senator in fundraising and has a deep line-up of A-list stars and top executives among her backers.   Celebrities don’t sway votes, but they can persuade people to listen to a candidate’s message, said historian Steven Ross, author of “Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics.”  “It puts a candidate on their radar,” he said. Hollywood actors, studio executives and other employees of the film, TV and music industries have donated at least $8.4 million to Clinton’s campaign and the independent Super PAC that supports her bid, Priorities USA Action, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance data through March 31.  A pair of Clinton fundraisers held by actor George Clooney this month, at which tickets went for as much as $353,000 per couple, is not included in that total, but were reported by Deadline Hollywood to have raised an additional $15 million. By contrast, Sanders' campaign had raised about $1 million from entertainment industry donors through March 31, according to the campaign finance data. The Vermont senator, who called the price of the Clooney event ""obscene,"" is not associated with a Super PAC and says he does not court wealthy donors. (Graphic on Hollywood flows to Sanders and Clinton: tmsnrt.rs/1U98K4g) All Republican presidential candidates combined collected $460,000, roughly 5 percent of entertainment industry donations, the data showed. Clinton’s support in Hollywood can be traced back to strong ties her husband built during his first presidential campaign in 1992, said Donna Bojarsky, a Democratic public policy consultant who worked as national entertainment coordinator for Bill Clinton’s campaign. Bill Clinton connected deeply with Hollywood, she said, in part because “he showed a real respect for and appreciation of pop culture. He followed it, and he enjoyed it.” Another reason for Hillary Clinton’s success in Hollywood is the backing of executives. While business people in Hollywood may be liberals, they are less likely to embrace a candidate who attacks corporations, said Ross, the historian. Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist who wants higher taxes on wealthy people and corporations to help pay for college, healthcare, and other programs. “Corporate Hollywood is about business and the bottom line,” Ross said. The biggest Hollywood contributors to date are behind-the-scenes figures rather than stars, with about two-thirds of Clinton’s industry support through March coming from just three donors.  Haim Saban, CEO of Saban Capital Group, contributed $3.5 million, while DreamWorks Animation DWA.O CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and director Steven Spielberg donated $1 million each to Clinton and funds supporting her. But it is the celebrity backers who make headlines for a candidate, even if they’re not making hefty contributions. Pop singer Demi Lovato performed at a Clinton campaign rally, and “Scandal” star Kerry Washington recorded radio and TV ads for the former secretary of state.  “I really believe in her capacity to deliver on her messages,” Washington said in an interview. Sanders welcomed the band Vampire Weekend onto a stage in Iowa, where they joined the candidate to sing “This Land Is Your Land.” The Red Hot Chili Peppers performed at a Sanders fundraiser in Los Angeles.  Clinton’s celebrity support skews toward older men and women, and she attracts more minorities, while younger personalities gravitate to Sanders, said Dan Schnur, director of University of Southern California’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and a former Republican political strategist.  These leanings reflect those of voters in general, Schnur said, though there are plenty of exceptions.  Ninety-year-old actor Dick Van Dyke, a Sanders supporter, is happy to buck the trend.   “People in my generation are set in their ways,” Van Dyke said in an interview. “Some people are afraid he might get a little too drastic, that he might do something to upset the apple cart.”   Sanders, not known for his sense of humor, has also attracted a number of comedians as supporters, including Danny DeVito, Bill Maher and Sarah Silverman.  “Bernie is not for sale,” says Silverman, a one-time Clinton backer, in a pro-Sanders video viewed more than 32 million times on Facebook. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime candidate who genuinely represents the people.” Schnur finds Sanders’ support among some comedians understandable. “If you decide to perform comedy for a living, you’ve probably got a little bit of an anarchist streak,” he said, and Sanders “challenges the establishment.”   THE BERNIE-HILLARY SPLIT At times the Sanders-Clinton divide in Hollywood has grown heated. When actor Susan Sarandon, a Sanders supporter, said in an MSNBC interview last month that she wasn’t sure she could vote for Clinton if she was the Democratic nominee, the reaction in Hollywood was intense. Her comments were seen as lending support to Trump.   Actor Jamie Lee Curtis, a Clinton supporter, tweeted that she respected but disagreed with Sarandon, calling her position “dangerous 2 women, minorities & migrants.” Debra Messing, one of the stars of NBC sitcom “Will and Grace,” also joined the Twitter fray, criticizing Sarandon for representing “the Bernie or BUST position which is so dangerous for our country.” Sarandon, who has donated $2,700 to Sanders, said her comments were reported incorrectly. “Of course I wouldn’t vote for Trump,” she said in an interview with Reuters. She is unrepentant in her support for Sanders. “We have to do something more than incremental change,” Sarandon said. Sanders is “about real change, progressive change,” she said. She said she worries about an industry backlash against Sanders supporters, given the reaction to her statements, as well as negative comments from feminist Gloria Steinem and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about women supporting Sanders.  “It’s a much easier thing to be supporting Hillary than to be supporting Bernie if you are a woman in the industry.”  In the end, Hollywood’s Democrats will unite behind Clinton if she wins the nomination, predicted USC’s Schnur. “A Sanders-nista is not going to flip over and vote Republican,” he said.

"Travelers Stranded and Protests Swell Over Trump Order - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump’s party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration. The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order. But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president’s order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained. More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the    administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting. The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process. Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president’s team never talked with him about it. White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325, 000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. “We’re not willing to be wrong on this subject,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject. ” The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States. With thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. “To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,” he said in a written statement. “This is not about religion  —   this is about terror and keeping our country safe. ” He noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama’s administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. “We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,” he said. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the   civil war in Syria. “I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,” he said. “My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. ” While Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors. As late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from   nations. In a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. “Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,” he wrote. “We cannot allow this horror to continue!” His order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. New York’s attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was “in compliance with judicial orders. ” Still, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained. The lawmakers arrived after 3 p. m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and “they said we’ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,” Mr. Connolly said. “I said that’s not acceptable,” he continued. “We want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That’s where the problem is, and that’s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable. ” The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to “claw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned. ” The mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at   Worth Airport. “We have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,” he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York. The order roiled relations with America’s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she “is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief. ” Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did “not agree with this kind of approach. ” The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump’s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. “Shame,” they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie “Finding Dory. ” “No hate, no fear,” they added later. “Refugees are welcome here. ” Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. “This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,” Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. “That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. ” Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump’s handling of the issue. “We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,” said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs’ donor network. “The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. ” Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was “poorly implemented” and urged the president to “make appropriate revisions. ” Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. “They are sadly weak on immigration,” he wrote. “Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. ”",0
"Trump campaign manager charged with misdemeanor battery against reporter (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s presidential campaign manager was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery in Florida on Tuesday in an incident involving a reporter, the latest chapter in a raucous U.S. race marked by threats, insults and physical confrontations. Police in Jupiter, Florida, charged Corey Lewandowski, 42, with intentionally grabbing and bruising the arm of Michelle Fields, then a reporter for the conservative news outlet Breitbart, when she tried to question Trump at a campaign event on March 8. Republican front-runner Trump repeatedly defended Lewandowski throughout a day of campaigning in Wisconsin. He also rescinded a previous pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee if it is not him. “No, not anymore,” he said when asked if he would honor his previous pledge. At a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Trump said he would remain loyal to his campaign manager and that Lewandowski would remain on the job even though it might be more convenient on behalf of his campaign to “terminate this man, ruin his life, ruin his family ... ruin his whole everything and say: ‘You’re fired.’” Trump also questioned Fields’ original description of the incident in which she said she was almost yanked to the ground by Lewandowski. He wondered aloud if she had posed a threat to him because she approached him with an ink pen. “She had a pen in her hand that could’ve been a knife,” Trump said. Police released a video of the incident showing Fields walking alongside Trump and trying to question him. Lewandowski is seen grabbing her arm and pulling her backward. Previous videos of the incident had been obscured by people in the crowd. At the time, Lewandowski called Fields “delusional” and said he never touched her. Campaign rallies for Trump, the billionaire businessman who leads the race to become the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election, are tumultuous at times and have been marked by occasional clashes between protesters and supporters or security personnel. His pugnacious campaign style, which includes personal insults directed at rivals and scathing criticism of protesters, has been criticized for encouraging physical altercations at his rallies. Trump leads rivals Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, and Ohio Governor John Kasich in opinion polls and in the number of delegates to the nominating convention, despite a concerted effort to stop him by a Republican establishment worried he will lead the party to defeat in November. Cruz said Trump “of course” should ask for Lewandowski’s resignation. “Look, it shouldn’t be complicated that members of the campaign staff shouldn’t be physically assaulting the press,” Cruz said on the CNN town hall. Kasich said he considered such behavior “totally and completely” inappropriate. “If it was me, if I was in this circumstance, I would take some sort of action, either suspension or firing,” Kasich told reporters in Wisconsin. Cruz picked up the endorsement on Tuesday of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker ahead of the state’s primary next week. Walker, who dropped out of the presidential race last year, called Cruz a principled constitutional conservative. “I’m all in,” Walker said in an interview on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee, adding he was not endorsing Cruz in an attempt to stop Trump. “I just fundamentally believe if you look at the facts, if you look at the numbers, that Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to both win the nomination of the Republican Party and to then go on and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall this year,” Walker said, referring to the Democratic front-runner. Walker joins a number of other more establishment  Republicans who have backed Cruz as an alternative to Trump, who has racked up a strong delegate lead but alienated many party leaders with his harsh views on illegal immigration, Muslims and women. On his plane, Trump said Fields had been pursuing him after a news conference and Lewandowski was trying to “get her off me.” He questioned whether Lewandowski had given Fields the bruise on her arm. “How do you know those bruises weren’t there before?” he asked reporters in Wisconsin. Republican strategist Katie Packer, who runs an anti-Trump Super PAC, said the incident and the charges against Lewandowski reflected the candidate’s lack of respect toward women. “He doesn’t have the kind of values and the kind of temperament that we should expect from someone who wants to be commander in chief,” she said. Lewandowski was charged with simple battery, defined under Florida law as intentionally touching or striking a person against their will. For a first offense, it is a misdemeanor in the first degree, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison or a fine of $1,000.     A court date was set for May 4, according to the police report. Jupiter police said Lewandowski turned himself in, and he was issued a notice requiring him to appear in court and then released. He was not booked into the jail.     Lewandowski’s lawyer, Scott Richardson of West Palm Beach, Florida, declined to comment on whether his client would step down as campaign manager. Lewandowski will also be represented by Kendall Coffey, a Miami lawyer, the campaign said.     Fields resigned from Breitbart less than a week after the incident, citing what she said was the online news outlet’s refusal to stand behind her amid the allegations.

"Trump intelligence nominee supports probes on Russian interference WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s nominee to be the director of national intelligence pledged on Tuesday to support thorough investigation of any Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, seeking to reassure lawmakers worried that partisan politics might interfere with a probe. “I think this is something that needs to be investigated and addressed,” former Republican Senator Dan Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee during his confirmation hearing to be the top U.S. intelligence official. Coats, 73, a former member of the intelligence panel, also promised that it would have full access to all of the documents and other materials needed for an investigation. “I have no intention of holding anything back from this committee,” Coats said. Trump denounced intelligence agencies for their assessment that Russia sought to influence the election on his behalf, prompting concerns about his support for them. Trump has also repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, leading some in Washington worry that he might not take a hard enough line in dealings with Moscow. In his opening statement, Coats addressed that concern by listing activity by Russia, along with that of China and North Korea, as among the main challenges faced by the United States. “Russia’s assertiveness in global affairs is something I look upon with great concern, which we need to address with eyes wide open and a healthy degree of skepticism,” Coats said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept. 11 attacks to oversee all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies and improve communications among them. One concern about Coats was his record on the U.S. use after the 2001 attacks of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, which are widely seen as torture. In 2015, he was one of the few lawmakers who opposed legislation sponsored by Republican Senator John McCain that made the use of such techniques illegal. Coats promised that he would follow the law, saying he voted against that legislation because he wanted “to at least have a discussion” about the best way to proceed if intelligence agencies wanted to obtain crucial information quickly. Coats also strongly defended U.S. government surveillance programs, though he said he would “do everything I can” to publicly disclose an estimate of the number of Americans caught in the crosshairs of internet surveillance programs intended to target foreigners.  But he stopped short of guaranteeing such a disclosure, which privacy advocates in Congress have requested for years and said is necessary to properly debate possible reforms to a surveillance law that expires at the end of 2017.  Although he was ambassador to Germany under President George W. Bush, Coats would be the first director of national intelligence who has not spent most of his career in the military, in intelligence agencies or as a diplomat. Coats, who is popular with Democrats and his fellow Republicans, is expected to be easily confirmed. ",0
"The Lighter Side of Rick Owens - The New York Times YOU KIND OF WANT the fashion designer Rick Owens to be a monosyllabic, misanthropic recluse. It’s what the embodiment of his clothes should be, if we were going by some unwritten aesthetic script. After all, the fashion Owens presents four times a year, for men and women, on the grand Paris stage, isn’t free and easy. It isn’t simple. It often looks like rags: Precious fabrics, like cashmere, are pilled and laddered, and leather is repeatedly washed to give it the texture and appearance of a prehistoric animal’s skin. There is something monstrous about his gothic garments, with their strange, disturbing proportions attenuated and exaggerated, draped like ectoplasm clinging to thin limbs. When people wear them head to toe, as Owens’s most enthusiastic followers frequently do, they don’t look human. They look other. “Troll clothes for the most desperate lemmings in the fashion herd,” one observer wrote in 2008 on The New York Times’s On the Runway blog. Owens appreciated the sentiment so much that he ran the phrase on his website, alongside   plaudits from the rest of the fashion world. There is, however, a disconnect between Rick Owens the man and Rick Owens the fashion designer. In photographs, Owens looks arresting, even sinister, with his   black hair and shroudlike attire, like the Grim Reaper crossed with a West Coast surf bum. (He often wears   shorts and sneakers, which undermines the goth undertones.) His spiky, sharply drawn features appear a little cadaverous. Presented in print, Owens  —   generally quoted on topics such as death, renewal, creation  —   can come across like a prophet of the apocalypse. And those monstrous “troll clothes” he designs often seem, at first glance, cold and hard, solid carapaces of fabric, sharply cut and difficult to wear. “I miss archness,” he murmurs, as if by way of explanation. “I think there was an arch moment in the ’40s in fashion, and I’m thinking forward, thinking about fashion cycles  —   that’s kind of a good cycle to bring back. ” But there’s something unexpectedly soft about Owens, both the man and his clothes. In person, he’s preternaturally tanned (he holidays in the United Arab Emirates, “the shortest flight to the most sun”) and his voice, a languid Californian drawl, redolent of the state where he lived until the age of 42, softens his doomsday portents. It adds both a humanity and a note of wry humor that collapses any perceived pretension. And in person, those clothes collapse too, in on themselves, softly wrapping the body in protective layers of felted fabric and down padding. Up close, his arch silhouettes prove light and pliable to the touch, seductive. In the middle of the last century, the couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga was first applauded, then deified by the fashion press for achieving the selfsame, and his approach influenced an entire generation of designers. Owens’s technique has stealthily proved just as influential. Balenciaga probably didn’t compare an especially visceral bunch of drapery to anal prolapse, as Owens has. But then he also, to my knowledge, didn’t confess to an interviewer that he dyes his own hair. “I’m thinking I better shut up now,” Owens says, almost as an aside. The delivery is so deadpan it begs for a punch line. “Is it possible for designers to talk too much, do you think?” He smiles, but thankfully doesn’t stop talking. Owens is 55, and was born in Porterville, Calif. a small city in the San Joaquin Valley. He moved to Los Angeles after graduating high school, originally studying fine art at the Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design, then dropping out after two years. “I wanted to be an artist at the beginning,” he says. “But then I didn’t think I had it in me. I didn’t think I had the intellectual stamina for it, so I decided to be a fashion designer, because that was frivolous and easy. ” Owens smiles wider. He is, again, deflating the myth that has grown around him. He doesn’t take himself as seriously as his work would lead people to believe. Unlike many fashion designers, however, Owens is able to articulate, precisely and vividly, what he’s trying to do with his clothes, namely talk about those big, overarching themes affecting humanity, and offer something different in the fashion landscape. When he talks, he makes you take him seriously. And he likes to talk. We meet in Paris to discuss his men’s wear which, perhaps even more so than his women’s wear, is revolutionary, and has proved groundbreaking in its influence. In a soupy sea of mediocre suiting and sportswear, he offers something entirely different from other designers. He boldly experiments with fabric and silhouette, pushing boundaries of sexuality and gender. Owens is as likely to propose a dress for a man as for a woman, but without sacrificing manliness in favor of runway novelty. “My stuff seems to attract guys that I think might want to consider themselves some kind of heroic lone wolf, kind of playing by their own moral codes,” Owens says, slowly. “I was thinking about men’s fashion, I was thinking in the ’80s Calvin Klein, he promoted male sexuality . .. males as an object of sexual attention. That was what happened then, and then in the ’90s men’s fashion was a reaction to that and it became about youth. It became skinny and slim and young and introspective and vulnerable. Now, what is now?” He stops. “If the last cycle was vulnerability, the obvious reaction would be heroism. ” Heroism for Owens isn’t about the   jacket or   pants. It isn’t about any cliché of dressing. Owens has created collections inspired by Nijinsky’s performance in “Afternoon of a Faun,” and by the athletic silhouette of Fred Astaire. In both he used drapery instead of tailoring, garments twisted and captured in motion, seemingly frozen in frenzied, balletic movement. He also jokingly stated a collection was inspired by “tops” and “bottoms”  —   not the garments, but rather the words denoting sexual preference in the gay vernacular. (Owens is bisexual.) For spring, Owens produced a remarkable collection, pumped with   colors of putty pink, peppermint and sulfuric yellow. But it was the silhouette that made the strongest impact: jackets abbreviated high on the torso, pants billowing organically around the leg, like a fusion of languid ’30s styles  —   Owens loves that period  —   and   skater trousers. It seemed totally out of place at a moment when other men’s wear designers showed either generic sportswear or predictably straight suiting. Owens isn’t overtly interested in tailoring, the linchpin of the masculine wardrobe since the early 19th century. You seldom see anything approaching a suit jacket in his shows. “I’m not going to be [who] somebody trusts for tailoring over Dior,” Owens says. “Even one of my partners. For his wedding, he wore Dior!” What he does offer is an alternative to the general thrust of fashion. And it’s seductive. His business is relatively small. His turnover is approximately $140 million, paltry when compared to the   luxury behemoths. But it’s perfectly formed. “My mantra for everybody is better, not bigger,” he says. “But it’s hard. When there’s a group of people together, they’re thinking of the team, and you want to win. Sometimes commercial success is a little bit more tangible than aesthetic success. ” Yet for all those disparaging comments about fashion lemmings, and the hordes of devotees clustered outside Owens’s shows in his most extreme looks, a core of his business comes from older, fashionable women and men, for whom a   asymmetric Rick Owens jacket is the dernier cri of   elegance. He also has a substantial celebrity following, although he doesn’t care about things like that. He’s often dubbed a “cult designer. ” “I hear the word cult used a lot,” he admits. “Which means you have a following, but you never hit the popular big time. ” But by his own estimation, Owens is not a cult designer. Like the Chanel jacket in the ’50s, his leather biker jacket has become part of a uniform of our times. Pay attention, and you’ll see it endlessly copied. Owens’s output is prodigious. Alongside his men’s and women’s runway lines and their commercial offshoots, he creates two accessibly priced secondary lines: Lilies, a range of   women’s wear, and Drkshdw, a more unisex streetwear incarnation that began as a denim collection. He also has a fur line, Hunrickowens. (From 2003 to 2006, Owens was the creative director at the French furriers Revillon Frères.) Owens designs nearly every facet of a contemporary wardrobe  —   outerwear and sportswear, accessories and shoes. Or, rather, redesigns it. His sneakers, produced with Adidas and retailing for several hundred dollars a pair, don’t look like other sneakers. With odd protrusions of rubber or leather, they resemble fossilized animal remains strapped to the body. His gloves sometimes have wings of leather, like dorsal fins. He also designs furniture. His dramatic pieces resemble great altars of Carrara marble or prehistoric slabs of    petrified wood. A bed he designed looks like a sarcophagus crafted from alabaster, and weighs over a ton. Even Owens’s toilets, in each of his three homes, look like chalices of marble. OWENS’S FASHION EXPERIENCE began in the commercial world of Los Angeles. After dropping out of art school, he worked for a factory that copied designer clothing in shoddier fabrics. In 1994, he started his own line, selling directly to retailers. He didn’t stage his first show in New York until 2002. A year later, he relocated to Paris. He still doesn’t speak French, which he doesn’t mind. “I was just as isolated in Los Angeles as I am in Paris,” he says. Owens is somewhat reclusive: He doesn’t go out much, his life revolving around his home, the gym and a couple of nearby restaurants. He lives and works in a single building, the former headquarters of the French Socialist Party, on a grand square opposite the French parliament. The only windows in his studio overlook the quiet, deserted garden of the former Ministry of Defense. Here, his aesthetic is complete. The floors and many walls are raw concrete. Owens gutted the building when he moved in, but didn’t do much else. Raw wires hang from the ceiling. I’ve visited him here three times, in three different years. Eventually I understood I wasn’t standing in the middle of a renovation. It was already complete. Owens lives with his wife of a decade,   Michèle Lamy, who is a creative force behind many of Owens’s endeavors. She codesigns a jewelry line with Loree Rodkin under the Owens umbrella named Hunrod (“Hun” is Owens’s pet name for Lamy, combined with Rodkin’s surname). She also collaborates with Owens on the design of his furs, and on his acclaimed furniture line, an exhibition of which is currently on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. She walks in halfway through our discussions, clad head to toe in Rick Owens. Her teeth glisten with gold, her fingers are tattooed and stained black. Together, they look remarkable  —   fascinating and terrifying in equal measure. They seem perfectly at home in Owens’s odd clothes among a grouping of their anthropomorphic spindly chairs that resemble something out of “Beetlejuice. ” “The furniture thing is really about completing . .. ” Owens stops, then continues: “Of completely creating my own planet. ” Near Owens’s studio window, a huge altarpiece of a table holds an arrangement of stone blocks, flowers and a skull. It looks eerily like a memento mori painting. He begins to talk about the darker themes within his work. His father, John, a former social worker, died in 2015, aged 95  —   which prompted a series of introspective, somewhat nihilistic collections. “How do you face decline gracefully?” he asks. “I suppose it was because of Dad declining and me getting older and me thinking about how we face change and all of that. Ecological change, and political threat. Me thinking, Isn’t all of this stuff maybe just supposed to happen?” He shrugs. “Our primal urge is to procreate. That’s one of the reasons that we’re on earth, our prime motivation is to procreate and to live forever. We’re doing our best to do both, so isn’t it inevitable that we just overcrowd it until something else happens? We just kill ourselves off? Something’s got to evolve. ” These are seldom ideas connected to fashion nor ideas fashion designers willingly talk about. “It’s sociology and anthropology,” he says. “It’s just the way  —   that’s what happens in real life. In real life, the act of creation is defying death. I think it’s just that dumb and simple. ”’ ”Preamble aside, Owens isn’t feeling particularly dour. It’s early December, and he’s planning his fall 2017 men’s wear collection, which he’ll show a month later in Paris. He named his previous two collections “Mastodon” and “Walrus. ” They concentrated on the primordial, with thoughts about mankind going the way of the dinosaurs. This season the theme is “Glitter. ” “It’s going to be about joyful abandon,” he says. The show is inspired by glam rock, full of   silhouettes with a theatrical bent, a hint of Bowie, possibly meeting Wagner, whose music Owens loves. There are lots of operatic trains. It doesn’t contain sequins, or beading or, indeed, any glitter. “Sequins in a collection called ‘Glitter,’’u2009” says Owens, making a face at such banality. He’s saving the embellishment for his next collection, he says. It’s going to be called “Dirt. ” “It was what can be as transgressive as possible for me,” Owens says. “Whenever I do anything transgressive, it’s never out of anger or just provocation. There’s usually something well intentioned, there’s a   spirit behind it. ” Owens pauses. He’s worried he’s talking too much again.” ’“It’s just going to start getting corny,” he reasons. “But there is another side of me that’s thinking not everybody reads those things. Not everybody is reading everything, so you should take every opportunity to put a positive message out whenever you can. ” Joy as transgression. It’s a fitting summary of Owens’s work, which, for all its subversion winds up feeling like a celebration of the power and energy of creativity. That Times comment on Owens’s website, disparaging his output, closed with the refrain: “A line needs to be drawn whereby credit is given to collections that deserve it. Too much talk is spent on too little. ” I’d argue that is precisely why Owens warrants such consistent applause. His collections deserve to be talked about, by us, and by Owens himself. They’ll be talked about by future generations, too, if Owens proves to be the Cristóbal Balenciaga of our time. Producing designs that defy fashion and challenge physics, turning the hard into soft, the cold into warm, blending masculine and feminine, he very well may be. “I always think that the act of creation is your fight for immortality,” Owens says. “The energy of resisting death, and trying to be remembered in the best possible way. ” He says it lightly. Then he stops talking.",0

"Tokyo Governor Koike to challenge Japanese PM Abe with new party TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike on Monday said she will lead a new national party that will challenge Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a general election expected to be called for next month. Koike, who named her new political group the Party of Hope, has emerged as a serious threat to Abe after she won the Tokyo governorship a year ago and in July fielded candidates who routed the LDP in elections for the metropolitan assembly.   I want the Japanese people to believe that there is hope for tomorrow,  she said at a televised press conference.  Our ideal is to proceed free of special interests,  she added. Koike is an ex-defense minister and former LDP member, and the challenge to her old party could pose a greater risk for Abe, who is expected to call a snap election for next month. Abe is benefiting from improved ratings and opposition disarray, but should he suffer a big loss of seats it could spur a challenge to his leadership from within the LDP.  A weekend survey by the Nikkei business daily showed 44 percent of voters will back Abe s LDP with only 8 percent supporting the main opposition Democratic Party. ",0
"2016: Remains of 61 Dead Migrants Recovered in One Texas County As the year end closed out in one Texas county, the remains of   human smuggling victims had been recovered in what has become known as the Brooks County killing fields. [Brooks County is not a border county. In fact, it is located about 80 miles north of the border. Yet it is the focus of human smuggling activity in South Texas that often leads to death for many of those who have paid for illegal transportation around a Border Patrol checkpoint.  “The Border Patrol checkpoint is located right in the middle of our county,” newly   Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas Sunday morning. “There is no way to move through the county for these human smugglers other than to attempt to sneak their human cargo through the checkpoint, or march them around the checkpoint and through the dangerous ranch lands in the county. This is where the deaths occur. ” Martinez told Breitbart Texas his county has recovered the bodies or remains of 61 people in 2016. “This happens because the human smugglers have no regard for human life,” Martinez said. “They will simply abandon anyone who cannot keep up with the group  —   leaving them to die from heat exhaustion, dehydration, or exposure to the elements. ” Breitbart Texas has accompanied Sheriff Martinez and other Brooks County deputies to the scene of body recoveries in the past. The rotting bodies and picked apart bones tell a tragic story of what must have been a horrifying and excruciating death for these people who paid as much as $6, 000 to   human smugglers to get them safely to their destination. “The treatment of these illegal immigrants by their human smugglers is horrific,” Sheriff Martinez told Breitbart Texas in June 2016. “The people they take on these marches around the checkpoint are   for the heat and hazardous terrain of these ranches. When they can’t keep up, they are left behind where they will die quickly if they don’t get help. ” The county, already strapped for cash, must deal with the cost of processing the remains and burial of the bodies. This can cost the county taxpayers up to $2, 000 per body, Breitbart Texas previously reported. Martinez is responsible for patrolling an area about the size of Rhode Island with a handful of vastly underpaid deputies. Communications capabilities are sketchy in many areas of the county where cell phones and police radios won’t work because of the lack of equipment. “We need help in establishing better communications for our deputies,” Martinez said. “It is important for officer safety, but it is also important when deputies come across someone in need of assistance. The migrants will frequently walk out of the fields and into the roadway after days of wandering lost in the fields. Many need help right away. ” Martinez said thing may soon get worse as the Border Patrol is expanding the checkpoint to eight lanes. “They are creating a smuggling superhighway right in the middle of our county,” Martinez expressed. “This could create even more pressure on our resources as more smuggling vehicles make their way north from the border. ” The new sheriff said they have seen an increase in traffic through the ranches. Increased presence from Border Patrol search and rescue teams, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers, and Texas State Guard search teams have helped keep the numbers of deaths down. Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the rescues of migrants who have been abandoned and left to die by the ruthless smugglers in the area. Border Patrol agents rescued an illegal immigrant woman trying to bypass a checkpoint in Brooks County in November, Breitbart Texas reported. She was found unconscious after being abandoned by human smugglers. In April, two teenage girls were rescued from a ranch in Brooks County after being abandoned. One of the girls, a    Mexican national, was found unconscious and clinging to life. She had to be transported by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital. “These heartless criminals take ruthless steps to exploit the multitude of poor immigrants from Mexico and Central America trying to reach the United States at any cost and the problem is getting worse,” Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla, Jr. said at the time in a written statement. “No one wants to see their loved ones being violated or abandoned in this manner. ” Death is not the only risk to the migrants being smuggled through Brooks County. Breitbart Texas previously reported, “about the specific kinds of horror faced by these illegal immigrants because of the open border policies of the federal government. Rape, abuse, abandonment and death are often the treatment these people receive from their human smugglers who are often connected to Mexican cartels. ” Now the task of stopping the human smugglers and ending the needless deaths of illegal immigrants in this South Texas county fall on Sheriff Martinez. “We appreciate the help with get from other agencies and from the volunteer police officers who give their time to help patrol our county,” Martinez said.  “We have limited resources, but we will continue to push to stop the human smugglers and to find the lost migrants before they succumb to the elements. ” Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

"Trump vows strong ties with Israel if elected president WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump vowed on Monday to pursue a strong U.S. alliance with Israel if elected president in November and said he would resist any attempt by the United Nations to impose its will on the Jewish state. In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Trump said he would side with Israel, a close U.S. ally, in any negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. “The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable,” he said. “They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel and they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish State,” Trump told the pro-Israel lobbying group. Trump also questioned the role of the United Nations in the peace process, saying any attempt by the international body to impose a Middle East agreement would be a disaster. ",0
"Sessions visits U.S.-Mexico border to push migrant crackdown Nogales, Ariz. (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Tuesday to make his case for increased prosecutions of illegal immigrants, pressuring U.S. attorneys to prioritize cases against criminal migrants. Sessions, a long-time proponent of tougher immigration enforcement, told U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at the Port of Nogales, Arizona, that more illegal migrants should be prosecuted as criminals.    It is normally the role of the Secretary of Homeland Security to meet border agents. But Sessions made the visit to highlight his focus on enforcing federal laws as dozens of U.S. cities try to shield illegal immigrants from stepped-up prosecution and deportation efforts. “Why are we doing this?” the former U.S. senator said. “Because it is what the duly enacted laws of the United States require.”   Sessions said that each U.S. attorney would be required to designate a point person on border security prosecutions by April 18. The person in that position, known as a border security coordinator, would be directed to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, according to Sessions’ memo.  The directive did not go beyond existing laws, but Sessions said his order “mandates the prioritizations of such enforcement” by U.S. attorneys.  The Trump administration has threatened to cut off U.S. Justice Department grants to so-called sanctuary cities that fail to assist federal immigration authorities.  Police in such cities have argued that targeting illegal migrants is an improper use of law enforcement resources. Sessions has said a failure to deport aliens convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk. Under U.S. law, anyone who harbors or transports an undocumented immigrant, has crossed the border illegally two or more times, resists an immigration officer’s arrest or commits travel document fraud is subject to criminal prosecution.  Other immigrants apprehended for crossing the border illegally face civil procedures, with deportation the only penalty.  Sessions’ announcement was the latest move by the Trump administration to deter illegal immigration. President Donald Trump has also called for not releasing migrants with pending court cases, targeting more people in immigration raids and building a wall on the southwest border.  Speaking just 50 yards from a border fence on the Arizona-Mexico border, Sessions said that adding more fencing to the border will be a “force multiplier” against illegal migration.  He also said the Justice Department plans to add 50 more immigration judges in 2017 and 75 more in 2018. Immigration judges oversee civil immigration cases, but there is a backlog of over 540,000 pending cases due a shortage of judges.  ",0
"On climate change, ideological and partisan polarization hardens Later this week, Pope Francis will reportedly make a moral case for combating climate change, arguing that it is mostly a problem created by humans and that we must make fundamental lifestyle and energy consumption changes to reverse course — on behalf of the world’s poor, but also on behalf of all of us. This, among other factors, could help push climate change on to the national political agenda, giving it more relevance to this cycle than it has enjoyed in previous years.

But if anything, the partisan and ideological divide over global warming is as wide as ever, and perhaps is getting worse.

That’s what a new Pew poll indicates. The Pew poll finds that worry about global warming is on the rise: Some 69 percent of Americans now say it is a “very” or “somewhat” serious problem. However, Pew also finds: “views about the significance of global warming as a problem continue to diverge.”

The Pew poll finds that 68 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming. But the partisan divide is stark: 86 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents say there is evidence of it, while Republicans are split, 45-48, on the question.

That’s driven (not surprisingly) by conservative Republicans, the only ideological group that says there’s no solid evidence of climate change — and when you get deeper into the partisan and ideological breakdown, the differences get more stark:

Today, roughly nine-in-ten liberal Democrats (92%) say that there is solid evidence the earth’s average temperature is rising, and 76% attribute this rise mostly to human activity. Very few liberal Democrats (5%) say there is not solid evidence of warming. A clear 83% majority of conservative and moderate Democrats also say the Earth is warming, but just 55% say this is the result of human activity. By contrast, just 38% of conservative Republicans say that there is solid evidence of global warming. Reflecting a divide within the GOP, conservative Republicans stand out as the only ideological group in which a majority (56%) says that there is not solid evidence of a rise in the earth’s temperature (a 61% majority of moderate and liberal Republicans say the earth is warming).

Meanwhile, as David Leonardt notes, skepticism about global warming is running high among GOP voter groups, such as older voters, whites, men, and white evangelicals.

While there are reasons to doubt that Hillary Clinton will be quite the climate hawk that some advocates hope for, in her Saturday kick-off speech she leaned harder than expected into arguments for robust action to combat climate change and transition towards a clean energy economy and future. It’s often said that climate is not a motivating issue for voters, and it’s true that Democrats and advocates have not cracked this problem yet. That said, whatever the impact on the electoral outcome, it’s still plausible that climate will have a significantly higher profile this cycle than it has in previous ones.

It’s not just that Clinton appeared to signal that she will campaign on climate, as part of a broader bet on the Obama coalition of millennials, non-whites, and socially liberal college educated whites. It’s also a confluence of other factors: The Obama administration will roll out new EPA rules for existing power plans this summer, and the court battles over them will intensify. Meanwhile, President Obama will be trying to negotiate a global climate deal later this year in Paris. All indications are he’ll be talking about the issue more and more, as a key piece of his legacy. These developments may coincide with the intensifying GOP presidential primary, in which the candidates will all be showcasing the zeal with which they’d roll back Obama’s agenda — the climate piece included.

All of which seems likely to only make polarization around climate change worse. No matter what Pope Francis has to say about it.

UPDATE: I should also have noted that the Pew poll finds that worry about global warming is on the rise: Some 69 percent of Americans say it is a “very” or “somewhat” serious problem. I’ve edited the above to add that.",0
"9 in 10 Gang Rapists In Sweden Have Foreign Origins A new report suggests that in cases of gang rape or sexual assaults involving two or more attackers in Sweden, 85 percent of the attackers come from a foreign origin. [The information comes from a Swedish website “Gang Rape Sweden” which has kept tabs on the various instances of group rape that have occurred in the country over a period from 2011 to 2015. The site lists the various rapists’ names, case numbers, and other details which show the national origins, if known, of the attackers. According to the site, “All records and documents available on this website are Swedish public records. ”  The site claims that in total between 2011 and 2015 there were 125 individuals accused and convicted of participating in group sex attacks. The majority, 41, come from unknown countries outside of Sweden, and they are followed by 23 from Afghanistan and 20 from Sweden itself. The total number of   amounts to 105 or around 85 percent. The site makes a distinction of those accused of true gang rape (participating in sex acts) and those tried along with a rapist for other crimes like failure to disclose the sex attack. Of the “true gang rapes,” they measure 50 such cases. Details are also given on the site as to the nature of the accusations, with thirteen of the gang rapists accused of having sex with underage children. Among those accused of molesting minors, none of the suspects are Swedish. The longest sentence for rape occurred in the case of Bardiya Coen Pajouhi, who comes from an unknown country and received a   sentence for aggravated rape, though it says he will not be deported to his country of origin. Among those convicted of raping a child, many of the attackers were underage themselves, which matches previous reports of young boys and girls being raped in or around asylum accommodations. In one particular attack, a group of boys from Afghanistan took another young asylum seeker into a wooded area in Uppsala where they beat and raped him, filming the attack on their mobile phones. The Afghani migrants who raped the boy, who is said to have been under the age of 15, were tried and found guilty, but will not be deported back to Afghanistan because Swedish courts have deemed the country “too dangerous” for them to return to. In the statistics provided by the site, only 30 of those convicted face deportation, as opposed to 73 who will not be sent back to their countries of origin, more than double. The Swedish government refuses to keep official statistics that track the origin of criminals and have not done so in over a decade. One police officer, Peter Springare, blew the whistle on migrant crime back in February of this year, claiming that almost all of the serious criminal activity in Sweden is committed by foreigners and migrants.

"Russia attacked energy, telecom and media in Britain: government official (Reuters) - Russian cyber operatives have attacked Britain s media, telecommunications and energy sectors over the past year, according to prepared remarks by the head of the government s  main cyber defense agency. Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), declined to provide any details on the attacks in a speech scheduled for Wednesday in London. The remarks follow comments on Monday from Prime Minister Theresa May in which she accused Russia of spreading disinformation and meddling in elections, echoing a heated debate in the United States over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Russian has strongly denied any election interference in the United States. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond when asked after normal business hours for comment on Martin s remarks. The NCSC, a branch of the GCHQ, Britain s main signals intelligence agency, has been in operation for a year and is charged with shoring up cyber security by working with a wide range of stakeholders. Martin said in his prepared remarks:  I can confirm that Russian interference, seen by the National Cyber Security Centre over the past the year, has included attacks on the UK media, telecommunication and energy sectors.   The agency was  actively engaging with international partners, industry and civil society  to tackle the threat from Russia, he said. Martin echoed May s comments that Russia was trying to  undermine the international system  with information warfare and cyber attacks.  Cyber security experts have long worried about attacks on electrical grids in particular, but Martin offered no evidence that the alleged Russian attacks succeeded in penetrating power systems or other critical infrastructure in the UK.

"No 'bespoke' Brexit, transition means 'status quo': Barnier BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said Britain must accept the full economic and legal status quo in a transition period after it leaves the EU and should expect no tailor-made terms on trade in its future relationship. Suggesting a transition should run for 21 months from Brexit on March 30, 2019 until the current EU budget expires at the end of 2020, Barnier said Britain would  certainly  remain subject to EU laws and courts during that transition.  During this period, the EU legal framework including on jurisdiction would continue to apply to Britain,  Barnier said in an interview published on Tuesday in Germany s Handelsblatt newspaper.  We don t have time to invent a new model. So for a short time after the formal exit from the EU the economic status quo would continue to apply, which besides the internal market also includes the customs union and collective political decisions.  In a version of the interview in Belgium s L Echo, he said of the transition:  The only difference is that the British would no longer take part in decisions on European legislation.  British Prime Minister Theresa May has proposed a transition of around two years to give time to put a new free trade pact in place, although she faces opposition in London from some Brexit supporters who want a clean, quick break. Barnier noted that May had rejected the option of staying in the EU single market long-term   the  Norwegian model  as he called it, referring to Norway s membership of the EU internal market, accepting all its rules and costs without having a say.  So we must work on other hypotheses,  Handelsblatt quoted him as saying.  Another option would be a free trade treaty using the example of the CETA agreement with Canada. It would take several years, however, to negotiate such an agreement.  Asked if that meant there could be  a specifically British model  along the lines of the  bespoke arrangements  May has referred to without giving detail, Barnier replied simply:  No.  Quoted by L Echo, he said a trade deal could be agreed in three years   meaning that if talks start in December it would be ready just in time for a transition ending in December 2020. He said his staff were already working on drafting a withdrawal treaty that will include terms for transition. Barnier said he still hoped that May could provide more detail on her offer to meet financial commitments on withdrawal so that EU leaders could agree in December to end their refusal to negotiate a future trade deal. May told an EU summit last week that she could not agree a figure until she knows what trade terms the EU offers. Barnier said it was important to  de-dramatise  talks on the payment. ",0
"A Trump Economic Boom? The Fed May Stand in the Way - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   Investors in financial markets, and those predicting faster economic growth in 2017, would do well to remember the famous words that William McChesney Martin Jr. the former Federal Reserve chairman, uttered way back in 1955: The Fed’s job is to remove the punch bowl just as the party gets going.   Donald J. Trump’s promises to cut taxes and regulation and to increase spending on infrastructure and defense have convinced many that a sugar high in the near term will goose the economy. But Fed officials say the economy is already expanding at something close to its maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth would drive inflation toward unwelcome levels. To avoid overheating, the Fed could respond by raising interest rates more quickly. The more Mr. Trump stimulates growth, the faster the Fed is likely to increase rates. “I guess I would argue that I think people have gotten a bit ahead of themselves about what a Trump presidency would mean,” said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura. “If we have a big stimulus, the logical thing for the Fed to do is to raise rates faster. There isn’t a whole heck of a lot of scope to just let the economy run under those circumstances. There’s a big question about whether fiscal stimulus under Trump just leads to higher interest rates. ” Underscoring that question, the Fed is expected to raise its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December in light of new economic data. The rate sits in a range of 0. 25 percent to 0. 5 percent, a low level intended to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and  . Analysts predict the Fed will shift the range upward by a quarter of a percentage point, modestly reducing those incentives. The rate increase is widely regarded as a foregone conclusion. The odds, derived from asset prices, topped 95 percent Monday, according to the CME Group. The looming question is how quickly the Fed will continue to raise rates in 2017. Economic forecasts always require large assumptions, but that is particularly true in the present case because Mr. Trump has provided relatively few details about his plans. Perhaps the most accurate thing that can be said about Mr. Trump’s victory is that it has increased the uncertainty of the economic outlook. “At this juncture, it is premature to reach firm conclusions about what will likely occur,” William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in a recent speech. During his campaign, Mr. Trump predicted 4 percent annual growth, and his actions since Election Day point to a   goal of   job creation. “Our No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth,” Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump’s pick to serve as Treasury secretary, said last month. Many economists regard such growth predictions as fanciful the economy has been mired in an extended period of slow growth and the reasons, including an aging population and a dearth of innovation, are unlikely to change quickly. Some think Mr. Trump is more likely to push the economy into recession than to catalyze a new boom. Even if Mr. Trump is right, however, the Fed does not want 4 percent growth. The central bank’s outlook has become increasingly gloomy. Officials estimated in September that annual growth of 1. 8 percent was the maximum sustainable pace, and they predicted growth would not exceed 2 percent in the next three years. They will update those forecasts Wednesday, but large shifts are unlikely. Fed officials also are increasingly convinced that steady job growth has substantially eliminated the   backlog of people seeking work. The unemployment rate fell to 4. 6 percent in November, a level the Fed regards as healthy. For years, Fed officials urged Congress to increase fiscal spending. Now, Mr. Trump is promising to do just that  —   and the Fed has concluded that it is too late. Stanley Fischer, the Fed’s vice chairman, said last month the Fed might still benefit from fiscal stimulus because it could raise rates more quickly. That would increase the Fed’s ability to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. But such gains would come at real cost: A fiscal stimulus would increase the federal government’s debt burden, which already is at a high level by historical standards, reducing the room for a fiscal response to a future downturn. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, urged Congress last month to be mindful that the government is already on the hook for more spending as baby boomers age into retirement. “With the   . D. P. ratio at around 77 percent, there’s not a lot of fiscal space, should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock, that did require fiscal stimulus,” she said. The tension between fiscal and monetary policy is likely to unfold in slow motion. Mr. Trump has promised to press for rapid changes in government policy, but Congress is not built for speed. A similar effort to cut taxes at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, for example, was signed into law on June 7, 2001. The impact of new cuts, and any increase in infrastructure spending that Mr. Trump can persuade dubious Republicans to embrace, would be felt mostly in future years. Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, predicted that tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and   spending would fuel faster growth in the first half of Mr. Trump’s   term. But he said that the Fed’s rate increases, and restrictions on trade and immigration, would gradually begin to take a larger toll. By the end, Mr. Zandi predicted, the American economy would be “unnervingly close” to recession. “The Fed and markets in general will ultimately wash out any benefit,” Mr. Zandi said Monday. “The economy under President Trump ultimately will be diminished. ” Other economists are more optimistic, predicting that the stimulus will not be fully offset by Fed policy. Mr. Dudley appeared to endorse this view in his recent speech, suggesting that the rise in financial markets was “broadly appropriate. ” Some of Mr. Trump’s proposals also could increase the economy’s potential growth rate, for example by improving infrastructure or encouraging corporate investment. On the other hand, the Fed’s march toward higher rates may be amplified by the bond market. Rates are already rising, and investors concerned about inflation and larger federal deficits are likely to generate persistent upward pressure. Those effects are already visible. Stock prices have climbed since Mr. Trump’s surprising victory, increasing the wealth of shareholders. But borrowing costs also climbed. The average rate on a   mortgage loan was 4. 13 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, up from 3. 54 percent just before the election.",0

"GOP candidates fight for spotlight ahead of Milwaukee debate The leading Republican presidential candidates are fighting for the spotlight as they charge into Tuesday night's primary debate, with Marco Rubio releasing a biting new ad ripping his former political mentor and Donald Trump suggesting he's arrested Ben Carson's rise in the polls.

Carson, for his part, has spent the last several days sparring with the media and his rivals over reports questioning his personal story, which is the crux of his campaign.

""I am trying to move on,"" Carson told Fox News. But his campaign manager also says Carson will punch back if an opponent challenges him on stage Tuesday night -- suggesting a departure for Carson from past debates, where he mostly avoided the fray.

The prime-time debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and The Wall Street Journal, will be held at 9 p.m. ET, from Milwaukee, preceded by an earlier 7 p.m. ET debate with lower-polling candidates.

This is the first time that just eight candidates will be on the main stage, a change that could give the contenders more time to explain their positions and engage each other.

Florida Sen. Rubio, in the hours before the debate, launched a striking ad against GOP rival Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor. The ad plays clips of Bush, before the 2016 campaign, praising Rubio.

""I'm a huge Marco fan,"" Bush says in one clip. In another, he says, ""He's probably the most articulate conservative on the scene today.""

The text of the ad blares: ""Jeb Bush before his phony attacks.""

Bush, the former front-runner, has struggled in every debate so far, and Rubio is no doubt angling for the edge against him in Tuesday's showdown. At the last debate, Rubio deftly parried a critique by Bush of his Senate absences.

Rubio is currently third in most national polls, followed closely by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who by many accounts had the stand-out moment in the last debate by slamming the CNBC moderators for allegedly unfair and off-topic questions. Speaking with Fox News on Monday, Rubio said the polls have been ""up and down,"" but ""what I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on the message of my campaign.""

Still tangling for the lead are Carson and Trump.

Speaking with Fox News, Trump pointed to the most recent polling in saying he's back on top.

""I'm No. 1 in the polls, as you know, in every single -- I think I'm No. 1 in every single state. I'm now No. 1 again in Iowa. I had lost Iowa for a period of time, and I didn't quite understand it,"" Trump said.

Trump has shown no hesitation about going after Carson, for everything from his past writings about having anger issues growing up, to stories questioning elements of his personal narrative, to Carson's statement that Egypt's pyramids were built by the biblical Joseph to store grain.

""He's having a hard time. The pyramids are solid structures. You can't put grain in the pyramids because they're solid structures,"" Trump said.

Trump, who hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" over the weekend, also made headlines overnight by suggesting a ""boycott"" against Starbucks over its holiday cups that are missing winter or Christmas scenes. But then Trump added, ""Seriously, I don't care.""

In a reminder of one of the key issues he's running on, though, Trump released a new policy paper Tuesday focusing on U.S.-China relations.

His campaign claims that under a ""Trump administration trade will flourish. However, for free trade to bring prosperity to America, it must also be fair trade.""",0
"Man Is Fatally Shot and 2 Officers Are Hurt at Brooklyn Housing Complex - The New York Times A man was fatally shot by the police at a public housing complex in Brooklyn on Saturday after he hit two officers with a police baton he had grabbed from one of them, the police said. The officers, who were in uniform, went to a building in the Van Dyke I Houses in the Brownsville neighborhood around 1:30 p. m. in response to a 911 call about a suspicious man, the police said. The officers approached a man on the building’s ninth floor and asked for his identification and a “scuffle” ensued, according to James Secreto, chief of the Police Department’s Housing Bureau. The man grabbed a baton from one of the officers and began hitting them both on the head, Chief Secreto said. Both officers then shot the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene, at 362 Sutter Avenue, the police said. Relatives and the police identified the man as Erickson Gomez Brito, 21, of 563 Mother Gaston Boulevard. One of the officers sustained a   gash on his head, the police said. Both officers were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for treatment, where they were in stable condition, the police said. Omahis Gomez Brito, 19, the victim’s sister, said her brother had been treated for depression three years ago but had not been taking medication recently. She also said he was treated for addiction at that time, but she did not specify for what. Speaking to reporters outside the building where she and Mr. Brito lived with their parents, Ms. Brito said: “I want justice for my brother. I want to know why they killed him. ” Mr. Brito’s father, Osiris Gomez, said in Spanish that his son was not violent. Mr. Brito’s aunt lives in the building where the shooting occurred, relatives said. Ms. Brito said the aunt lived on the first floor, and she was not sure why her brother was on the ninth. The   Van Dyke I complex is in the 73rd Precinct as well as in the middle of a   area that is among the poorest in the city, according to an analysis done by Queens College in 2014. There had been 12 homicides in the precinct this year, though none at the complex, Police Department statistics show. Katt Williams, who lives in the neighborhood, said she knew Mr. Brito. “Minds his business,” she said. “It’s sad. ”",0

"Trump's 'Paterno' comment sparks jeers on social media (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump drew guffaws and derision on social media after he asked a campaign rally in Pittsburgh, “How’s Joe Paterno?” The legendary Penn State University football coach died four years ago.  “I went to school in this state. I know a lot about Pennsylvania and it’s great,” Trump said. “How’s Joe Paterno? We gonna bring that back? How about that whole deal?”  The term ""Joe Paterno"" quickly became a top trending topic on Twitter, with many asking if Trump knew Paterno was dead. A video clip was posted on YouTube.  Paterno, once one of the most revered college athletic coaches in the United States, was fired by Pennsylvania State University in 2011 over a child sexual abuse scandal involving assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. Paterno died on Jan. 21, 2012. Sandusky was later convicted on child sex abuse charges.  Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the candidate was referring to a statue of Paterno that was removed from the campus in 2012. A Quinnipiac University survey in 2015 showed that many Pennsylvanians want it returned to the campus.  Penn State spokesman Ben Manning said on Thursday the university does not comment on candidates’ campaign speeches.  Social media users mocked Trump for seemingly implying that he would bring Paterno back to life.  ""Someone should tell Trump that Joe Paterno is dead and also that he conspired with a serial child rapist,"" tweeted kept_simple (@kept_simple).  BuzzFeed political editor Katherine Miller (@katherinemiller) tweeted, ""Trump obviously meant when are we going to bring back the Paterno statue and then, subsequently, Paterno back from beyond, through sorcery.""  Twitter users with accounts geo-tagged to the university’s home, the town of State College, had mixed reactions.  ""Bring Paterno back? @realdonaldtrump has odd expectations of his abilities, and responsibilities, as president,"" tweeted Holly Swanson (@StateCollegeMom).  Not all reaction was negative.  ""All Trump has to do is say he'll bring the Paterno statue back. He'll win PA in a landslide,"" Kalooz (@Kalzony53).  Trump had weighed in on the fallout from the Sandusky scandal in July 2012 when the National Collegiate Athletic Association levied sanctions against Penn State’s football program. He said in a tweet that the program should be suspended.  ",0

"Glenn Greenwald: Dems ‘Suddenly Love Leaks,’ But Attacked Them Under Obama - Breitbart Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” Glenn Greenwald said Democrats who “suddenly love leaks” about President Donald Trump’s administration thought people who leaked to the media during the Obama administration were “villains,” “traitors,” and “they ought to go to prison. ”  Greenwald said, “The problem is if you look at the last eight years, there has been a very concerted war on not just sources and whistleblowers, but also journalists, implemented by not Donald Trump but by the Obama administration. More sources prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act than in all previous administrations combined. Journalists such as James Rosen at Fox News and Jim Risen at The New York Times and those of us who worked on the Snowden reporting constantly threatened with prosecution or having our phone records subpoenaed and the like. ” “And Democratic officeholders in D.

"Dallas attack adds to Cleveland concerns before Republican convention CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Cleveland police on Friday tightened their security plan for the Republican National Convention after the deadly shootings of police officers in Dallas, increasing surveillance and intelligence operations just 10 days before the convention. Other police departments across the country required officers to patrol in pairs rather than alone following the ambush in Dallas, the deadliest day for police in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. In Cleveland, the attack raised another potential threat during the July 18-21 convention, when Donald Trump is expected to receive the Republican nomination for president.  The police officers’ labor union, rank-and-file cops and some outside experts had already questioned Cleveland’s preparedness for the convention with the city’s police under federal supervision over use of force. Ten days before the event, Cleveland was still training police officers for duty at the convention, which is expected to draw 50,000 visitors as well as clamorous protests and crown the most contentious presidential candidate in memory. Rather than a security team reinforced by the country’s largest police departments as it hoped, the city has cobbled together 3,000 officers, mostly from state agencies, who will use borrowed and rented equipment. “When the convention was awarded to Cleveland (in 2014), folks weren’t thinking about this.... Yes, there is a generalized worry,” said Matthew Barge, court-appointed monitor for the U.S. Justice Department’s oversight of Cleveland police. Ed Tomba, the city’s deputy police chief and head of convention security, had previously told Reuters he was “very, very confident” in the city’s convention plan. He reiterated that confidence in a telephone interview on Friday in response to the Dallas attack. “We have got to make some changes without a doubt,” Tomba said, mentioning the surveillance of potential threats from street level and farther away.   “We will have plenty of people watching over different locations. We are beefing up the intelligence component, too. They are going to be very, very active,” Tomba said. Police throughout the United States ordered their officers to work in pairs following the shooting in Dallas, including those in New York, Chicago and St. Louis. New York officers will “double up” on all assignments and auxiliary police officers who are unarmed except for night sticks will not be used in the field for the next few days, Police Commissioner William Bratton told a news conference. St. Louis police also will be required to wear ballistic vests when leaving any station for enforcement activities, Chief Sam Dotson said on Twitter. Tomba said he spent part of Friday morning reassuring out-of-town police departments that their officers on loan to Cleveland will be safe during the convention, telling them in an email that “we cannot pull the plan off without them.” Cleveland police union President Steve Loomis has been among the most vocal critics, complaining that front-line officers would be undertrained and poorly equipped.  “They are setting up my guys for failure,” Loomis said before the Dallas attack. Civic leaders have said Cleveland is experiencing a renaissance following decades of decline, and that reputation will be on the line during the convention. Two separate incidents of fatal police shootings in recent years have brought unwelcome national attention to the city. In 2012, 13 Cleveland officers fired 137 shots into the car of an unarmed African-American man and his female passenger, killing both. The U.S. Justice Department investigated and imposed special federal oversight known as a consent decree that remains in force. Then in 2014, four months after the Republicans chose Cleveland for the convention, a white police officer shot dead 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was black, in a case that became a national focal point for the protest movement Black Lives Matter.  The most recent report from the federal monitor overseeing the Cleveland consent decree portrays a police department where physical infrastructure is strained, with computers and cars “run-down or deficient,” forcing police to pay for repairs out of their own pockets and use their personal vehicles for police  work.  Loomis, the union leader, said half of Cleveland police officers have yet to receive convention training. That number is “probably close,” Tomba said on Thursday. Upon getting the convention, Cleveland asked 200 police departments to send officers, including those from big cities which generally have the best anti-terrorist schooling. Many big cities turned Cleveland down, saying they were unable to spare officers, Tomba said. But Cleveland has exceeded its goal by bringing in 3,000 reinforcements who will receive training at home plus a short course upon arriving, Tomba said. ",0
"Iraqi government asks foreign countries to stop oil trade with Kurdistan BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq on Sunday urged foreign countries to stop importing crude directly from its autonomous Kurdistan region and to restrict oil trading to the central government. The call, published in statement from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s office, came in retaliation for the Kurdistan Regional Government s plan to hold a referendum on independence on Monday. The central government s statement seems to be directed primarily at Turkey, the transit country for all the crude produced in Kurdistan. The crude is taken by pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean coast for export. Baghdad  asks the neighboring countries and the countries of the world to deal exclusively with the federal government of Iraq in regards to entry posts and oil,  the statement said.  The Iraqi government has always opposed independent sales of crude by the KRG, and tried on many occasions to block Kurdish oil shipments. Long-standing disputes over land and oil resources are among the main reasons cited by the KRG to ask for independence. Iraqi Kurdistan produces around 650,000 barrels per day of crude from its fields, including around 150,000 from the disputed areas of Kirkuk.  The region s production volumes represent 15 percent of total Iraqi output and around 0.7 percent of global oil production. The KRG aspires to raise production to over 1 million barrels per day by the end of this decade. Kurdish oil production has been dominated by mid-sized oil companies such as Genel (GENL.L), DNO (DNO.OL), Gulf Keystone (GKP.L) and Dana Gas (DANA.AD). Major oil companies such as Chevron (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM) also have projects in Kurdistan but they are mostly at an exploration stage. However, Rosneft, Russia s state oil major, has lent over $1 billion to the KRG guaranteed by oil sales and committed a total of $4 billion to various projects in Kurdistan. ",0

Gambia’s former President Yahya Jammeh once pledged that he would reign for a billion years. But last month he fled into exile, 22 years after taking power in a coup. His democratically elected successor has since accused Mr. Jammeh, above, of plundering the treasury and fleeing with millions of dollars. A   source of income for Mr. Jammeh, though, had been a   scheme. For years, his government sold residence permits  —   sometimes costing up to $15, 000 apiece  —   to thousands of Chinese millionaires. Why? A special program meant to encourage investment in Hong Kong allowed wealthy Chinese citizens to gain the right to live there if they had permanent residence in another country. As of 2013, some 9, 000 Chinese obtained residence permits for Gambia. The maneuvering went on until 2015, when Hong Kong suspended the program. A review found that many of the people enrolled didn’t eventually settle in Hong Kong. Instead, they used their Hong Kong passports for easier travel to other countries (but probably not Gambia).

"A Traumatized Brain That Helped Heal a Broken Heart - The New York Times I knew it would be bad the only question was how bad. After waiting outside a surgical ward at Jersey City Medical Center for what seemed like an eternity, the neurosurgeon emerged, introduced herself and explained that blood clots were forming in my husband’s brain, a result of multiple fractures to his skull. Even after an extensive operation, internal swelling and pressure on his brain were building to levels “inconsistent with life,” the doctor explained. To survive the night, he needed another operation. Less than 24 hours earlier, on Dec. 13, 2014, Steve  —   my husband and the father of our two young children  —   left our Brooklyn apartment for a networking trip in Atlantic City with four colleagues. Throughout the day, he sent me text updates, including a goofy selfie intended to amuse our daughter, then 3 years old. Around 6 a. m. I received a call from two of the colleagues who had been with him in Atlantic City. Steve had been in an accident, they said, and I should call the emergency room. They had been with him all day, but couldn’t explain what happened to him. At the hospital, I began to piece together the severity of Steve’s condition. The trauma staff members told me that his face was so disfigured and bruised that they had difficulty determining his race. His doctors concluded that he had been assaulted. (The story of his surgery, and the mystery of his injuries, were described in an article in The Atlantic last spring.) After that second brain surgery, his neurosurgeon, Dr. Lauren Schwartz, returned to tell me she had to remove significant chunks of Steve’s frontal lobe and temporal lobe  —   and that he might not be able to speak or function normally ever again. Even if he managed to emerge from the medically induced coma with his faculties intact, Steve had a long and arduous road ahead, most likely measured in years, with no guarantee that he would return to his former self. Many victims of a brain trauma become overwhelmed by anger, depression and frustration about the slow pace of their recovery and the memory of who they used to be. The severity of Steve’s trauma  —   and the apparent violence that caused it  —   were   triggers for those emotions. But after Steve’s initial surgeries, I became increasingly confident about his chances for a successful recovery. “If I know one absolute truth about my husband, it is that he rises above and exceeds expectations,” I wrote in an email to Dr. Schwartz. In retrospect, a reflexive coping mechanism may have been kicking in  —   any reasonable analysis should have drastically lowered my expectations. But I believed I had reason for optimism. Steve’s brain was engineered to move forward. As a gifted mathematician, he saw the world as a series of equations to be solved. And like an elite athlete, he didn’t handicap goals with unhelpful emotions. Steve had been wiring his brain at an early age, partly out of necessity. Raised in a house beset by mental illness, he had to learn to protect himself from harmful emotions and focus on goals. It served him well academically, as he skipped a grade in middle school and went to college at 16. It was a risky social and emotional step for someone so young, but he graduated with honors and was recruited by Goldman Sachs as a programmer. I have always been drawn to his   wit and his Olympic reasoning abilities. In an argument, Steve could keep his head while others lost theirs. I didn’t always appreciate his economy of emotion. In 2008, when our first child, Sophia, was stillborn at 39 weeks and four days, I carried around her memory, nearly crippled by the weight of the loss. Steve appeared set on moving forward from the very beginning. In the delivery room, I asked Steve to hold Sophia, which he did, but he quickly returned her to the bassinet, seemingly signaling his intent to move on. Over time, my anguish turned to resentment over how he could forge ahead, focus on his work and not share my pain. For years, even when we went on to have two healthy children, I still felt compelled to carry the emotional weight of Sophia’s memory. But after Steve’s horrific injuries, I knew I had to try to learn to do for my husband what I had been unable do for myself: keep my brain from dwelling on tragedy. Almost two years later, I can still allow myself to become furious about what happened to my husband, still an unsolved mystery. I want to know what happened and who was responsible and have the perpetrators admit their guilt. A part of me wants to linger daily on the unknowns. But Steve inspired me to follow his lead, as I witnessed his unrelenting drive to return to his former self  —   and his refusal to be consumed by what happened to him and why. One afternoon, a few days after he awoke from his coma, Steve received a visit from a former colleague he had not seen in more than a decade. Still suffering   amnesia, Steve couldn’t speak coherently or remember my name. But when his colleague entered the room, Steve’s eyes widened. He wiggled upright and offered a handshake. It was a moment I celebrated for days. Weeks later, with parts of his speech returning, Steve made another leap when he gestured for a pen and notepad. He wanted to jot down the conversations he was having with the nursing staff. Jagged lines were all he could manage, but he remained unbowed, asking me to transcribe the conversations regarding his recovery plan. As the pace of Steve’s progress accelerated  —   in words and movements  —   I became consumed with planning for the next steps in his recovery, making arrangements for his rehabilitation, staging our apartment for his return. Looking backward was a luxury I could not afford. When Steve finally came home in early March, every daily event  —   going to the grocery store, walking the kids to school, reading the news, listening to our favorite pop songs  —   became a learning opportunity, a chance to regain words and memories that had been temporarily lost. At dinner, the kids played word games with Steve, each taking turns to contribute to a category. One evening, when the topic was zoo animals, Steve couldn’t locate the word lion. Instead of expressing frustration or embarrassment, he described its color, sound and habitat. When our daughter blurted the answer, Steve’s face lit up. “Yes, you got it!” he shouted, slyly giving the game a new dimension. We were witnessing Steve do what was second nature to him: finding the path forward. Researchers still have a lot to learn about what causes some victims to swiftly recover from brain traumas and others to stall. Steve’s doctors marvel that he is doing so well. His   determination may have helped. Within 12 months of his   trip to Atlantic City, Steve had secured a job as a business analyst with an international bank. Without any visible scars or speech impairments today, he doesn’t show any signs of brain trauma. Indeed, even with portions of his brain gone, he has somehow retained his intelligence and career skills, his ability to be a loving husband and father, and the core elements of his identity that let his lifelong habit of looking forward shine through. He’s taught me that true tragedy is letting misfortune rob you of the life and love you have. It’s a lesson I try to keep in my head as nourishment for my heart.",0
"U.S. belatedly begins to comply with Russia sanctions law WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Thursday said it had belatedly begun informing Congress and others about groups associated with the Russian intelligence and defense sectors as required under a 2017 law tightening sanctions on Russia. The Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which became law on Aug. 2, among other things imposes sanctions on Russia to punish Moscow because U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia carried out a hacking and propaganda campaign to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.  The law calls on the president to impose sanctions on anyone  he identifies as having engaged “in a significant transaction with a person that is part of, or operates for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors” of the Russian government. The law required the Trump administration to “specify the persons that are part of, or operate for or on behalf of, the defense and intelligence sectors” of the Russian government by Oct. 1, a deadline the administration missed. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has now authorized the State Department to identify such people or entities, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters. She said notification to Congress, as well as to industry, allies and partners, had begun and that public guidance on the matter would posted on the agency’s website soon, although she suggested this would not happen on Thursday. “We expect to post the full public guidance on state.gov shortly ... a lot of these conversations are still ongoing between Congress, industry, allies and also partners,” Nauert said at a briefing. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker this week said he wanted administration answers about why it failed to meet the deadline for implementing the sanctions on Russia. However, he said he spoke to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan by phone on Thursday and afterward said in a statement that the department’s guidance “is a good first step in responsibly implementing a very complex piece of legislation.”    ",0
"Iran Gives Investors Glimpse of $30 Billion in Oil Deals to Come Iran is targeting about $30 billion in investment by offering 70 oil and natural gas projects to international companies as the Persian Gulf country anticipates the lifting of economic sanctions.

Iranian officials presented the projects at a two-day conference in Tehran as part of an effort to attract more than $100 billion to revive the energy and petrochemicals industries and generate much-needed government income. Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh introduced them along with a new type of investor contract offering better incentives than the buy-back agreements Iran offered in the past. The work covers 52 production and 18 exploration projects, both onshore and in the Gulf and Caspian Sea.

Iran is offering a negotiable framework for new oil deals rather than a uniform contract for all investors, Roknoddin Javadi, managing director at National Iranian Oil Co., said Saturday in Tehran. The government may modify the framework and plans to present more details in February at a conference in London, Seyed Mehdi Hosseini, chairman of the ministry’s Oil Contract Restructuring Committee, said Sunday in an interview.

Here are five things to know about this turning point in Iran’s campaign to upgrade its energy industry:

* The new investor contract will give companies a share of the oil they produce and let them sell it globally, Hosseini said in Tehran. International companies will be paid in cash or in kind based on a fee per barrel, Talin Mansourian, a consultant with Hosseini’s committee, said Saturday. Iran would reduce the fee if oil prices fell by more than 50 percent and increase it if prices rose by a corresponding amount, Mansourian said.

Iran’s old buy-back deals paid companies a fixed fee regardless of how much oil they produced and offered them no incentive to exceed output targets. Buy-backs also paid no compensation to companies that spent more than budgeted amounts to develop a field.

Under the new contracts, the NIOC won’t limit capital spending and will approve budgets on a yearly basis, though companies still won’t receive a higher fee if they produce above their output targets, Hosseini said.

* The new contracts will be valid for 20 years, with possible extensions to 25 years. Buy-back agreements were limited to seven years, which wasn’t enough time for companies to make adequate returns on their investments, Total SA Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said last month in Abu Dhabi.

Investors should be able to recover their development costs five to seven years after starting production, according to Iranian officials. Companies that come up empty-handed after exploring for oil or gas can search for fuel in nearby areas. Under buy-backs, they had to stick to development plans agreed upon before work began and were barred from exploring new areas.

* Companies will be able to negotiate directly for some contracts, and Iran could sign its first deal as early as March or April, Hosseini said. Iran won’t allow foreign companies to escape their contractual obligations if the U.S. or another party re-imposes unilateral sanctions, said Seyed Mostafa Zeynoddin, an adviser to the committee. If the UN restores sanctions, a company could claim force majeure if unable to execute a contract, he said.

* International investors must team up with local partners that the Iranian government selects, and they can’t own hydrocarbon deposits. Iran will let international and local companies determine the stakes each will hold in joint-ventures formed to develop fields.

* Iran is preparing to start the bidding process for oil and gas rights by the next Iranian calendar year starting March 21. Companies will be asked to make bids based on a per-barrel development fee, Mansourian said. NIOC will announce other terms when it starts the tendering process in four to five months, she said.",0
"Bodybuilder dies after celebrity Muay Thai match with ex-Singapore Idol contestant SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singaporean bodybuilder has died after a celebrity Muay Thai fight against former Singapore Idol contestant Steven Lim in the city-state, the event organiser and local media said. The match on Saturday was the 32-year-old Pradip Subramanian s first Muay Thai fight, the Straits Times newspaper reported on Sunday. Subramanian was a late replacement for Lim s original opponent, Sylvester Sim, who pulled out because of insurance issues. Both Sim and Lim, a YouTube personality, were contestants in the first Singapore Idol series in 2004. After the match, which was won by 41-year-old Lim, Subramanian was rushed to the hospital where he died, media reported. The match was part of the inaugural Asia Fighting Championship, which was organized by Axseed Events, an event management firm, and Muse Fitness Club, a Muay Thai training facility. Subramanian died at the Singapore General Hospital at about 1300 GMT on Saturday, Asia Fighting Championship said in an emailed statement.  According to the preliminary medical report released by Singapore General Hospital, Mr. Pradip Subramanian suffered a cardiac arrest respiratory failure episode which led to his passing,  the statement said, adding the final medical report would be released in 30 to 60 days. Lim said in a Facebook post:  Rest in peace, my really truly respected fearless warrior and fighter and awesome boxing instructor, Pradip Subramanian!!!  ",0
"South Korea's Moon unveils new focus on Southeast Asia BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday unveiled a new policy aimed at deepening ties with Southeast Asia, as the North Asian economic powerhouse seeks to curb its reliance on traditional trading partners like China and the United States. Moon made Indonesia, Southeast Asia s biggest economy, his first state visit to the region and was accompanied by a delegation of around 200 business leaders.   The  New Southern Policy  aims to better connect South Korea to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping and expand the economic influence of Asia s fourth-largest economy in the region home to more than half a billion people.  Korean diplomacy in Asia has been more toward Japan, China and Russia. But I see that it should expand to new horizons,  Moon told a business forum in Jakarta, where he pledged to  dramatically strengthen cooperation with ASEAN .  South Korea s presidential Blue House has said the policy will mirror Moon s  New Northern Policy  aimed at expanding cooperation with China, Japan, Russia, and Mongolia. Indonesia and South Korea signed on Thursday a memorandum of understanding on a light rail transit (LRT) system in Jakarta, part of a series of pacts reported to be worth up to $1.9 billion.   A recent year-long diplomatic standoff between Seoul and Beijing over the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system has exposed the dependence of Korean companies on Chinese customers  and likely exacerbated Seoul s urgency to diversify ties.  During a joint news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump this week, Moon said he was aiming for a more  balanced diplomacy,  which would include Russia, ASEAN countries, and members of the European Union. Moon held talks with Indonesian President Joko Widodo at a state palace in Bogor, south of Jakarta, and discussed infrastructure, trade, and also tension on the Korean peninsula.  I appreciate President Moon s position that he remains open to resolving any disputes through dialogue,  Widodo told a news conference in the Dutch colonial-style palace.  Indonesia has traditionally had good relations with North Korea and maintains diplomatic ties and is one of a small number of countries with an embassy in Pyongyang.  A number of South Korean companies already have or are planning big investments in Indonesia. Steel giant POSCO has a multi-billion-dollar joint venture with Indonesia s Krakatau Steel, Hyundai Motor is setting up a car factory, and Samsung Electronics Co assembles smartphones in the country. Indonesia is also emerging as an important market for South Korean defense equipment and the countries are cooperating on a venture to jointly build a fighter plane, dubbed KF-X. Moon said South Korea aimed to boost trade with Indonesia to $30 billion by 2022 and eventually to more than $50 billion. Trade between the countries was worth about $10 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up nearly a fifth from the corresponding 2016 period. Korean foreign direct investment rose about a quarter to $1.37 billion. Both leaders said the relationship between the countries had been redefined as a  Special Strategic Partnership .     South Koreans make up one of Indonesia s largest expatriate groups, with numerous Korean restaurants and bars in parts of Jakarta. Besides corporate muscle, Korea s soft power has also grown in Indonesia alongside other countries in Southeast Asia. Korean K-Pop is hugely popular among Indonesians, with long-established fan clubs and bands, like BTS, touring the Southeast Asian country. Indonesian Twitter accounts dedicated to Korean pop idols have around a million followers. ",0
"New York, other states challenge Trump over climate change regulation WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of 17 U.S. states filed a legal challenge on Wednesday against efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration to roll back climate change regulations, deepening a political rift over his emerging energy policies. Led by New York state, the coalition said the administration has a legal duty to regulate emissions of the gases scientists believe cause global climate change. “The law is clear: the EPA must limit carbon pollution from power plants,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement announcing the challenge.  Trump signed an executive order last week targeting climate change regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama, saying they hinder U.S. energy production and jobs without providing meaningful environmental benefits.  The order’s main target was Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a law that would require states to slash carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, but which was never implemented because it was challenged in court by 26 Republican-led states. Trump’s order directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review the regulation to decide whether to “suspend, rescind, or revise it.” Shortly after, EPA filed a legal motion asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to delay ongoing court proceedings on the regulation to allow for the review. The New York-led coalition’s motion on Wednesday asked the court to throw out the EPA’s request to delay court proceedings, saying the delay “would waste the substantial resources already expended in this litigation.” “This case is ripe for decision now, and nothing that EPA has proposed to do obviates the need for this court’s review,” according to the statement. The coalition includes attorneys general from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington - along with the District of Columbia and a number of smaller localities.

"Trump vows to stay in race after lewd remarks surface  (Editors Note: Attention language that may be offensive to some readers in paragraphs 22, 23, 24) By Emily Stephenson and Ginger Gibson NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With his campaign in crisis, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed on Saturday to stay in the race despite calls from more than two dozen prominent Republicans for him to drop out following the release of a recording of him making lewd comments about women. Both Trump’s wife and his running mate criticized his words, saying they were insulting and indefensible.  “The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly -  I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN!” Trump wrote on Saturday afternoon on the social media website Twitter.   The video was the latest calamity for Trump, who had hoped to revive his flagging campaign in the face of a recent drop in polls with less than a month until Election Day.  Trump is due to appear alongside Democrat Hillary Clinton on Sunday in their second debate in the run-up to the general election. Clinton is not expected to address Trump’s video before then.      The 2005 video of Trump talking on an open microphone showed the then-reality TV star speaking about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania. In a statement, Melania Trump called her husband’s words “unacceptable and offensive to me.” “This does not represent the man that I know,” she said. “He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.” The backlash over the video was swift and widespread.  More than 60 prominent Republican current and former officeholders issued statements condemning Trump’s remarks about women, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and John McCain, the party’s standard bearer in 2008. More than 20 called for Trump to end his presidential bid.  In an unusual move, his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence issued a critical statement of Trump’s words, saying on Twitter that he “cannot defend them.” “As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump,” said Pence, who is governor of Indiana. Pence indicated he would continue to support Trump, despite calls from several Republicans for Trump to step aside and let Pence be the nominee.     There is no precedent for a major party to replace its nominee this late in the campaign and it was unclear if there was an avenue to force him out. Voting has begun in several states, including swing states Virginia and North Carolina. A recorded apology by Trump early on Saturday did not stymie an avalanche of calls from members of his party to quit.  Trump huddled on Saturday in Trump Tower with senior advisers, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Despite previous scheduling, Giuliani will appear on five major Sunday morning news programs, a rare round robin reserved for major news events - replacing Republican Chairman Reince Priebus on CBS’s “Face the Nation” and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on “Fox News Sunday,” a last-minute switch. No reason was given for the bump of Conway. A CBS news release said the RNC asked to replace Priebus because Trump’s operation wanted “a campaign person” to appear on the program. Trump left the building briefly to greet a small crowd of supporters, saying “100 percent” he would remain in the race. Before returning to a bank of elevators, he told reporters, “Tremendous support.” He quickly moved to do damage control in Saturday’s video in which he declared himself a changed man and attempted to shift the focus to his opponent Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. On Twitter, Trump posted critical statements from Juanita Broaddrick, a woman who has accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her. “Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,” Trump said in his video statement, posted on his Facebook page.     Trump has struggled to win over women voters, and the video was expected to further feed Democratic criticism about his past behavior toward women. Trump’s support has suffered among suburban women and white, college-educated women, groups that Republicans have traditionally won. In the recording that triggered the firestorm, Trump said of one woman, “I did try and fuck her. She was married.” He went on to discuss his attraction to others. “I just start kissing them,” he said. “And when you’re a star they let you do it.” “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything,” Trump said. On Saturday afternoon, CNN published a separate report detailing remarks Trump made over the course of several years while appearing on Howard Stern’s radio program. The remarks included discussing the size of his daughter’s breasts and that he once had sex with three women at the same time. Trump was asked if he would have sex with a black woman and responded, “It depends on what your definition of black is.”  The remarks were the last straw for some Republicans who have stuck with him through a series of controversial remarks, including calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “criminals,” calling for a ban on Muslim immigrants, attacking a judge of Mexican descent, attacking the Gold Star family of a Muslim soldier killed at war and saying Senator John McCain was not a war hero because he had been a prisoner of war. House Speaker Paul Ryan disinvited Trump to a scheduled appearance on Saturday in Wisconsin. Pence declined to speak in his place. The list of Republicans announcing they would not vote for Trump or calling on him to step aside grew on Saturday: Senators Kelly Ayotte, Lisa Murkowsi, Dan Sullivan, Mark Kirk, Jeff Flake, John Thune, Mike Crapo, Shelley Moore Capito and Mike Lee; House members Jason Chaffetz, Mia Love, Joe Heck, Bradley Byrne, Martha Roby and Barbara Comstock; and Governors John Kasich, Dennis Daugaard and Gary Herbert.  Additionally, former presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Carly Fiorina and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on Trump to quit. “Donald Trump’s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy,” McCain said in a statement.  While Democrats largely remained silent, opting to let Republicans attack one of their own, Vice President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter, “The words are demeaning. Such behavior is an abuse of power. It’s not lewd. It’s sexual assault.”  Some prominent Republicans indicated they would stick with Trump. Ralph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, and Tony Perkins, head of the conservative Family Research Council, said they would continue to support him. “I think 10 years ago he was a different man,” said Representative Jack Kingston, a Republican from Georgia. “I am very glad that he quickly apologized.” ",0
"White House says it can't lawfully pay Obamacare subsidies WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said late on Thursday that it cannot lawfully pay subsidies to health insurance companies under the Obamacare health law, prompting howls of protests from Democratic lawmakers. A White House statement said based on guidance from the Justice Department, “the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare.” “In light of this analysis, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments,” the statement said.

"U.S. top court takes up Republican challenge to Maryland electoral district WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday added a second case to its docket on a contentious issue that could have major consequences for American elections, agreeing to decide whether Democratic lawmakers in Maryland unlawfully drew a congressional district in a way that would prevent a Republican candidate from winning. The court’s agreement to take up an appeal by Republican voters in Maryland regarding the U.S. House of Representatives district came two months after the justices heard arguments in a high-profile challenge by Democratic voters to Republican-drawn state legislative districts in Wisconsin. Both cases target a practice known as partisan gerrymandering that aims to entrench one party in power and that critics have called a distortion of the democratic process. The justices have not yet issued a ruling in the Wisconsin case. Each case presents a different legal theory as to why limits should be placed on partisan gerrymandering, and the court’s decision to take up a second case on the issue hints that at least some of the nine justices are seriously considering cracking down on it.  Gerrymandering, a practice dating back two centuries in American politics, involves manipulating boundaries of legislative districts to benefit one party and diminish another. Legislative districts around the United States are redrawn every decade after the national census to reflect population changes. The “redistricting” in most states is done by the party in power though some states assign the task to independent commissions. The Supreme Court for decades has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination but never those drawn simply for partisan advantage. In the Maryland case, the Republican voters targeting the Democratic-drawn electoral map appealed a 2-1 ruling in August by a panel of three federal judges sitting in Baltimore rejecting their challenge. Maryland’s sixth congressional district, the focus of the case, was previously held by a Republican and now is held by Democrat John Delaney. When the Supreme Court heard arguments in the Wisconsin case on Oct. 3, the justices appeared closely divided, with conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy likely to cast the deciding vote. The Republican challengers in Maryland take aim at a single electoral district, not the whole state as in the Wisconsin case. They argue that the district should be struck down because it was drawn by Democrats as a form of retaliation on the basis of past party affiliation based on the Constitution’s guaranteed rights of free association and free speech. The challengers in the Wisconsin case argued that the Republican electoral map violated Democratic voters’ rights to equal protection under the law as well as free speech and association. In the Wisconsin case, the legal argument advanced by the Democratic challengers was that an electoral map would be unlawful if the intent was to discriminate against minority party voters, the map had a sizable effect in accomplishing that goal and that there was no other justification for the map. The theory was based in part on measuring the number of “wasted” votes in each district cast for a losing candidate and comparing each party’s total wasted votes on a statewide basis. The results, plaintiffs said, show whether one party’s votes are more likely to be wasted than the other party’s, which would show evidence of unconstitutional extreme partisan gerrymandering. ",0
"Ukraine Lawmaker Who Worked With Trump Associates Faces Treason Inquiry - The New York Times Prosecutors in Ukraine are investigating whether a member of Parliament committed treason by working with two associates of President Trump’s to promote a plan for settling Ukraine’s conflicts with Russia. In a court filing on Tuesday, prosecutors accused the lawmaker, Andrii V. Artemenko, of conspiring with Russia to commit “subversive acts against Ukraine,” in particular by advancing a proposal that could “legitimize the temporary occupation” of the Crimean peninsula. Russia forcibly annexed the peninsula in 2014, a step that Ukraine, the United States and other governments have refused to recognize Mr. Artemenko said his proposal would allow Ukraine to formally cede control of the territory to Russia, at least temporarily. Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, posted a copy of the court filing to his Facebook page on Tuesday with the statement “Ukraine’s integrity is above all else. ” Mr. Artemenko’s plan, reported on Sunday by The New York Times, outlines a series of steps meant to bring to an end the rebellion by   separatists in eastern Ukraine, and to resolve the dispute over Crimea by allowing voters to decide whether to lease the peninsula to Russia for 50 or 100 years. Settling those issues could give the Trump administration a path to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Artemenko traveled to New York in January to discuss the plan with Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, and with Felix H. Sater, a   business associate of the Trump Organization who scouted business opportunities in Russia for the company as recently as 2015. Mr. Cohen said he delivered the proposal to the White House in a sealed envelope in early February. Mr. Artemenko, a   politician who has tried to brand himself as a   populist, has not been arrested or formally charged with a crime. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ukrainian news outlet Strana. ua quoted him as saying that the investigation was “politically motivated. ” “I’m not going anywhere, and will meet with investigators to explain my position,” he was quoted as saying. Mr. Artemenko has claimed he received encouragement from the Russian authorities for his effort, but the Kremlin has denied any knowledge of his proposal. He has also claimed to have evidence of corruption that could help lead to the ouster of the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals concerning the war in Ukraine, which has cost more than 10, 000 lives. White House officials have suggested that they would be open to lifting sanctions against Russia, but they have also demanded that Crimea be returned to Ukraine. Word of Mr. Artemenko’s peace plan has prompted outrage among many officials in Ukraine. Some accused him of being a secret Russian agent, and there have been calls for him to relinquish his seat in Parliament. On Monday, fellow Radical Party lawmakers voted unanimously to expel him from the party. The suggestion that Crimea be handed over to Russia legally, even for a limited time, particularly outraged Crimean Tatars, the ethnic group in Ukraine whose members consider the peninsula their historic homeland. Refat Chubarov, a Tatar member of Parliament, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Artemenko should be stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested. “Given the continued Russian occupation of Crimea,” he wrote, “which is characterized by the total suppression of the rights and freedoms of the Crimea Tatar people violent kidnappings and killings of peaceful citizens arrests of Crimean Tatar citizens and attacks on their homes and families as well as the persecution of journalists, the actions of Andrii Artemenko are unequivocally qualified as treason. ”",0
"Trump’s F.C.C. Pick Quickly Targets Net Neutrality Rules - The New York Times WASHINGTON  —   In his first days as President Trump’s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the Obama presidency. Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted   internet service to   individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. In total, as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week, many buried in the agency’s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. They said Mr. Pai’s message was clear: The F. C. C. an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration’s rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration. “With these   tactics, Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes,” said Matt Wood, the policy director at the consumer group Free Press. “The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people,” he added. “Instead, it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for. ” Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years. Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. ’s authority, Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean. He noted that his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election. Many of those efforts, Mr. Pai argued, went beyond the agency’s legal authority. “These   actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward,” Mr. Pai said in a statement released Friday. “Accordingly, they are being revoked. ” The efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media, telecommunications and the internet. The biggest target will be net neutrality, a rule created in 2015 that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic. The rule, which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility, was the tech centerpiece of the Obama administration. On Friday, the F. C. C. took its first steps to pull back those rules, analysts said. Mr. Pai closed an investigation into   practices of the wireless providers   ATT and Verizon.   is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download. If a provider like ATT offers free streaming of its DirecTV programs, does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage? Under its previous leadership, the F. C. C. said in a report that it saw some evidence that made it concerned. But Mr. Pai said after closing the investigations into wireless carriers that   was popular among consumers, particularly   households. “The speed of the ruling and the chairman’s tone are very encouraging for internet service providers,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen. “I think it’s a down payment on net neutrality, with much more to follow. ” Last week, Mr. Pai said he disagreed with the move two years ago to declare broadband a utility. The reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules, but he faces legal hurdles. A federal court upheld the rules last year, and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules. Mr. Pai will have the help of powerful members of Congress who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a   service. And he is popular among Republican leaders, including the Senate’s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who with other members viewed Mr. Pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the Obama years. Mr. Pai, 44, the child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, is a fresh face for the Republican Party. Congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency’s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules. Also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers. “The agency has strayed from its core mission,” said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee. She has called for a hearing within two weeks on the F. C. C. agenda under the new administration. Democrats in Congress said they would fight legislation that waters down net neutrality rules. They said Mr. Pai, described as a   student of telecom law, would be a tough adversary, and they face great opposition from Republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturning of net neutrality rules. “The key here is that it’s already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this,” said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California. “Ajit Pai is intelligent and genial, but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest. ” Most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around Mr. Pai’s early actions. That included a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for   consumers. None of the providers currently serve   consumers, but Mr. Pai’s comments could foreshadow a   of the Lifeline   subsidy program. On Monday, the F. C. C. is scheduled to appear before a federal judge to defend its push to curb extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison. But it told a judge a few days ago that Mr. Pai disagreed with many aspects of the case. Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat of the three sitting members of the F. C. C. warned that the actions would directly harm consumers. “Rather than working to close the digital divide, this action widens the gap,” Ms. Clyburn said.",0
"Let’s Say Obamacare Is Repealed. What Then? - The New York Times The election of Donald J. Trump gives the Republicans in Congress a chance to act on their   desire to get rid of Obamacare, a wish that Mr. Trump mostly says he shares. Aaron E. Carroll and Austin Frakt, the health policy analysts for The Upshot, discuss: Then what? Aaron: I think it’s safe to say few in Congress thought they would have this opportunity. But like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the car, after untold futile attempts, Republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the Affordable Care Act. Now comes the essential question: Will they actually do it? They’ve been promising it forever, but I am still skeptical that it will happen. I believe you disagree. I’m going to let you go first. Why do you think they’ll do it? Austin: I think they’ll do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of repeal, having passed bills to repeal, partly repeal, delay or defund the A. C. A. in the House something like 60 times. Just the other day Senator Mitch McConnell endorsed repeal (again). The House and Senate also agreed to do so, in large part, in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year. The only thing that prevented it was that President Obama vetoed it. I doubt Mr. Trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity. Now, I know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full repeal, because according to the rules it can only touch   provisions. This excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime limits, among other measures. I also must add that I’m much less confident of a repeal (or partial repeal) without agreement on a replacement. But I’ll turn it back to you, Aaron. Do you think the G. O. P. has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to repeal? Or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits? Aaron: I think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier benefits, but not too much. There’s a part of me that thinks many in Congress were always so willing to vote for a “repeal” because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law. They got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside. Actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their health insurance, without anything in return. This would be an unmitigated political disaster. The stories  —   of people with cancer, diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold  —   would very likely dominate our discussion for months. That leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections. With no Democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame, I think this would be akin to what happened in the 2010 elections, but in reverse. Now, if they can coalesce around a “replace” plan that doesn’t leave too many people out, then I think they could move forward. But in all the years since the A. C. A. was passed, Republicans haven’t been able to do that. Do you think they can? What do you think that plan would look like? Austin: One way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that doesn’t call for repeal for several years, at least after the 2018 midterms, though possibly after the 2020 election. Between now and then, there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces Obamacare that didn’t just dump people off coverage with no alternative. But the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly. Absolutely there will be bad stories. But keep in mind, there will be bad stories under Obamacare, too. Rocketing premiums, huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success. Republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if they’re making Obamacare better. They’re actually in a tough policy spot. They’ll get the blame if they don’t fix or repeal the A. C. A. and they’ll get the blame if they don’t replace it with something people like better. Health policy is a very difficult and thankless task. I think they’ll opt for something they can call repeal and replace, but they could also just let Obamacare struggle and die. Neither looks good. One other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states. Do you think a Trump administration, working with a G. O. P. Congress, will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from Obamacare? If so, what are some ideas states might try? Aaron: I think it’s very likely those in Congress could punt Medicaid to the states. For years, they’ve been trying to change Medicaid funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time. This will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce Medicaid spending in the future, while forcing states to make the tough decisions  —   and take the blame  —   for cuts in either beneficiaries or services. Fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges, though, is a different story. Without some sort of market regulation, which they’ve generally been opposed to, the same problems that existed  . C. A. with respect to   conditions and individual ratings will exist. Many people will become uninsured. Annual and lifetime limits could reappear. Lots of people will have problems getting insured. Moreover, I have yet to be convinced that a significant number of Republicans in the House might coalesce around such a plan. Maybe for Medicaid, but I’m not sure about the exchanges. Even if they could, it’s likely the Democrats in the Senate would try to filibuster either of these plans. Don’t you think? Austin: Yes, I think Democrats would filibuster anything they could. The filibuster is not set in stone. A Senate majority can change it, and some are already calling for the G. O. P. to do so. But that doesn’t appear to be what the Senate will do  —   they’ll retain the filibuster. This could play to their favor, since they can propose things they like, let the Democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement. Perhaps that’s another way for Republicans to get out of their political bind. Aaron: I’m sure we’ll have more to discuss as President Trump’s administration comes into power.",0
"Croatia wants to adopt euro within 7-8 years: prime minister ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia aims to become a euro zone member within the next seven to eight years, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said on Monday.  We don t want to specify the exact dates, but we want Croatia to become a euro zone member within two government terms in office,  Plenkovic told an economic conference devoted to the introduction of the euro in Croatia. The centre-right government came to power a year ago. Plenkovic said Croatia wanted to enter the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM-2) within the next three years, before the country takes the presidency of the European Union in 2020. EU members that have not yet adopted the euro are expected to participate for at least two years in ERM II, a mechanism aimed to ensure currency stability before joining the euro zone. The Croatian central bank already keeps Croatia s kuna currency in a narrow fluctuation band, roughly at between 7.3 and 7.7 to the euro, occasionally intervening on the local foreign exchange market mostly to ease appreciation pressures. Croatia s major challenge before adopting the euro is expected to be the reduction of public debt which is slightly above 80 percent of gross domestic product.  Our goal is to reduce the public debt to 72 percent of GDP by 2020 ... We are undertaking a major fiscal consolidation and this year the budget gap will be even lower than last year s 0.9 percent of GDP,  Plenkovic said. Central Bank Governor Boris Vujcic said Croatia was the most  euroised  EU country of those that had not yet adopted the euro.  Some 75 percent of local deposits and 67 percent of local debt is denominated in the euro. Some 60 percent of Croatia s trade exchange is related to the euro zone, while 70 percent of tourism receipts comes from the euro zone countries,  Vujcic told the conference. The most important benefits of euro adoption would be the removal of currency risk and lower interest rates, he said. Croatia took an obligation to adopt the euro when it joined the EU in 2013, but without a defined timetable. Vujcic said any fears among the population about prices soaring when the euro is adopted could be tackled by an obligation to display prices in both kunas and euros six months before an agreed euro zone entry date.

"‘Take The Money!!’: Emails Show How Clinton Campaign Manages Lobbyist Donations The latest batch of emails released by WikiLeaks provides a rare glimpse into how Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign handles money from U.S. lobbyists who are registered agents for foreign interests.

In an email chain with the subject, “Re: Foreign registered agents,” various figures in her presidential campaign discuss the best way to handle donations from U.S. lobbyists who are registered agents for foreign parties.

The chain features Dennis Cheng, national finance director for the Clinton campaign, asking, “We really need make a policy decision on this soon – whether we are allowing those lobbying on behalf of foreign governments to raise $ for the campaign. Or case by case.”

The emails continue with a debate about the best way to manage lobbyists working for foreign interests who want to raise money for the campaign.

Jesse Ferguson, deputy national press secretary and senior spokesman for Clinton, tries to understand just how much money is up in the air. “Is there anyway to ballpark what percent of our donor base this would apply to (aka how much money we’re throwing away) Cost benefits are easier to analyze with the costs. :)”

The emails feature a list of foreign agents that the Clinton campaign was worried about possibly excluding from fundraising, including people lobbying on behalf of Somalia, United Arab Emirates, Kurdistan, the Transitional Government of Libya, and the Republic of Iraq, among others.

Later, Cheng seems worried about losing this potential fundraising, writing, “Hi all – we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA are already donating and raising. I do want to push back a bit (it’s my job!): I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general, and then DNC and state parties)… and how do we explain to people that we’ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them; that the Foundation takes $ from foreign govts but we now won’t. Either way, we need to make a decision soon.”

Finally, Robby Mook, campaign manager for Clinton, writes, “Marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don’t really get you anything…that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result. He convinced me. So…in a complete U-turn, I’m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that?”

Jennifer Palmieri, director of communications for Clinton’s campaign, responds to that email, “Take the money!!”

"Terror attack over, 147 dead at Kenya university NAIROBI, Kenya — Armed terrorists stormed a university in northern Kenya on Thursday, killing 147 people, wounding dozens and taking hostages during a 15-hour siege until four militants were killed by security forces. Christians and converts to Islam appeared to have been the targets.

More than 550 students were evacuated and 79 were injured in the standoff on the Garissa University campus, about 90 miles from the Somali border. The Somali-based Islamic terrorist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack — the al-Qaeda-linked organization's deadliest in Kenya.

Students said the gunmen separated Christians from Muslims and held hostages in a dormitory, where they placed explosives around the Christian hostages, according to Kenya's National Police Service.

Kenyan Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery said some students were killed during morning prayers at the mosque. Jackson Kamau, a student at the university, said the militants killed those who were likely converts to Islam. Locals can differentiate between Somali Muslims born into Islam and those who have converted because they come from different ethnic groups.

""We'll not allow terrorists to divide our country on religious lines,"" said Aden Duale, majority leader in Kenya's National Assembly.

Most of the 147 dead were students. Two security guards, one policeman and one soldier also were killed in the attack, Nkaissery said.

One suspected extremist was arrested as he tried to flee, Nkaissery told a news conference in Nairobi.

Heavy gunfire erupted at the college as the Kenyan military worked to end the siege. Police Inspector General Joseph Boinett said a dusk-to-dawn curfew will be in place in Garissa and three neighboring counties starting Friday through April 16.

The White House strongly condemned the attack and said the United States was providing assistance to the Kenyan government.

""We extend our deep condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed in this heinous attack, which reportedly included the targeting of Christian students,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.

Kenyan police offered a $220,000 bounty for Mohammed Mohamud, also known as Dulyadin and Gamadhere, who they suspect planned the attack.

Students who were able to escape said gunmen stormed the university, setting off explosives and shooting people on the campus just after 5 a.m. local time.

""Most of us were asleep when the incident happened,"" said Nicholas Ntulu, a student at the university. ""We heard heavy gunfire and explosions. Every person ran for dear life as we passed the gunmen. Several (students) were shot dead.

""There was nobody to help us at the time of the attack,"" he said. ""The police officers took more than an hour to arrive at the scene.""

President Uhuru Kenyatta urged Kenyans to stay calm. ""This is a moment for everyone throughout the country to be vigilant as we continue to confront and defeat our enemies,"" he said.

Kenyatta ordered the inspector general of police to accelerate the applications of 10,000 recruits for the Kenya Police College.

""We have suffered unnecessarily due to shortage of security personnel,"" he said. ""Kenya badly needs additional officers, and I will not keep the nation waiting.""

Frightened students rescued from the university gathered at a military camp near the Garissa airstrip.

""The sounds of gunfire was all over — we couldn't tell what was the right direction to go to be safe,"" said Ann Musyoka, a second-year student. ""We had to face the gunmen — they shot several people as we escaped towards the gate.""

Victims were rushed to a hospital, and those critically injured were airlifted to the capital, Nairobi.

""I was not at the institution when the incident occurred, but several students phoned me, crying over the attacks,"" said Jacktone Kweya, the dean of students. ""When I tried calling them back, their phones were off. It's very disturbing.""

Robert Godec, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, said the United States ""strongly condemns"" the attack.

""We extend our deepest condolences to all who have been affected,"" he said in a statement. ""The attack once again reinforces the need for all countries and communities to unite in the effort to combat violent extremism.""

The assault comes in the wake of an intelligence report issued last week by security officials warning that al-Shabab was planning an attack on major institutions in retaliation for Kenyan military action in Somalia as part of an African Union initiative against the group.

Al-Shabab has carried out several attacks in Garissa and across Kenya in the past few years, including an attack in 2013 at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi that left 67 people dead, and others on mosques in Mombasa, a coastal city in the east.

Nairobi-based security analyst Abdiwahab Sheikh said the incident highlights how the government has failed to shore up security in the country.

""The government has not learned anything from the Westgate attack,"" he said. ""How do you allow terrorists to take students hostage for more 10 hours? I think our security forces need to learn from the past.""",0
"Trump, Clinton meet again at 'humorous' Al Smith dinner NEW YORK — Well, that got awkward quickly.

What began as the expected ribbing of presidential candidates at the white-tie Al Smith Dinner Thursday turned to boos as Donald Trump described Hillary Clinton as ""corrupt"" at the event, which is a major fundraiser for the Catholic charities connected to the Archdiocese of New York.

Trump's biggest laugh of the night came as he referred to his wife's partly plagiarized convention speech, in a joke that began with his complaint that the media is biased.

""Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, they think she's absolutely great. My wife, Melania, gives the exact same speech and people get on her case!"" Trump said.

As laughter and applause filled the room Trump speculated he was in ""trouble"" with Melania for the joke, and implored to Cardinal Timothy Dolan: ""Cardinal, please speak to her.""

The crowd stayed with Trump while he ticked down a list of what he called ""corny"" jokes about being a former Democrat and sarcastically calling himself ""modest."" And they mostly laughed along when he joked about Clinton accidentally bumping into him back stage and saying ""pardon me.""

""I very politely replied: Let me talk to you about that after I get into office,"" Trump landed the punchline. Clinton was seen laughing.

But Trump was quick to take some campaign trail attacks with him to the dais at the annual dinner. He called Clinton ""so corrupt she got kicked off the Watergate Commission"" and lobbed his usual line that Clinton has been in politics for 30 years and accomplished little. ""I can fix it, she says,"" he deadpanned as the crowd's mood noticeably shifted.

As the boos rolled in Trump wondered who they were booing. ""I don't know who they're angry at Hillary, you or I?"" he said. Someone in the crowd yelled out ""you!""

Trump's next line struck a nerve. ""Here she is in public, pretending not to hate Catholics,"" Trump said, referencing an apparent email exposed by WikiLeaks in which a Clinton spokeswoman seemed to joke about Catholics and evangelicals.

Trump also brought up a moment from the debate Wednesday night.

""Last night, I called Hillary a 'nasty woman.' This stuff is all relative. After listening to Hillary rattle on and on, I don't think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore. In fact, I'm actually starting like Rosie a lot,"" Trump said.

The Democratic nominee, for her part, poked fun at herself while also taking searing jabs at her opponent. Clinton didn't hesitate to slam Trump for his past comments on women and his ambivalence about accepting next month's election results.

In contrast with Trump, Clinton also made a point of acknowledging both the purpose and the history of the Al Smith dinner and closed her speech with a big-picture campaign message that was tied to the positive focus of Thursday's Catholic fundraiser.

Clinton did receive several loud groans from the audience at several of her jokes. Her top zingers included jabs about Trump dismantling a prompter at a rally last week and her opponent's propensity toward speaking favorably about Russia.

""Maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day. And I get that. They're hard to keep up with and I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian,"" she said.

Clinton also joked about her health, which Trump has made an issue on the campaign trail, as well as criticism over paid speeches. ""I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here,"" Clinton told the audience. ""Usually, I charge a lot for speeches like this.""

Turning to Trump, she said, ""Donald, if at any time you don't like what I say, feel free to stand up and shout 'Wrong!' after I say it.""

And diving into the dominant news of the day, she said: ""I'm surprised I'm up here at all. I didn't think he'd be OK with a peaceful transition of power.""

But Clinton had her own sharply-worded jokes. ""People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants. A beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four — maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,"" she said.

Clinton joked that ""getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle.""

""There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump. Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate. And look, I've got to tell you, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer,"" Clinton said. ""Now, actually I did: it's called preparation.""

Finally, Clinton found a foe that both parties could rally against: ""Let's come together, remember what unites us, and just rip on Ted Cruz.""",0
"PM Hariri urges Lebanese to put country first BEIRUT (Reuters) - Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said on Thursday Lebanon s political crisis was  a wake-up call  for Lebanese with different loyalties to put their country ahead of regional issues. Hariri was referring to the crisis ignited by his shock announcement on Nov. 4 that he was resigning. He made it from Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy and regional powerhouse locked in a confrontation with Shi ite Islamist Iran. After returning to Lebanon this week, he shelved the decision on Wednesday at the request of President Michel Aoun.  The period that passed was perhaps like a wake-up call for all of us to look for Lebanon s interests rather than looking at problems around us,  Hariri said at the Annual Arab Banking Conference in Beirut on Thursday.  The problems around us are important, but Lebanon is more important.  Hariri reaffirmed the need for Lebanon to stick by its policy of staying out of regional conflict  not just with words but with action as well .  I want to stress that ... our main concern is stability, and this is what we ll be working on.  Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, the head of President Aoun s political party, wrote to the Arab League chief on Thursday, stressing Lebanon s policy of staying out of regional crises, the state news agency reported.  The regional role played by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah political and military movement has greatly alarmed Saudi Arabia, Hariri s long-time ally. Hezbollah s parliamentary group met on Thursday and said in a statement afterwards that Hariri s return to Lebanon and his  positive statements  signaled a possible return to normality. Hariri said on Wednesday his decision to postpone resigning would lead to  a responsible dialogue ... that deals with divisive issues and their repercussions on Lebanon s relations with Arab brothers.  Top Lebanese officials have said Riyadh forced him to quit and held him in the kingdom. Riyadh and Hariri deny this. Hariri returned to Lebanon after an intervention by France. A leader in Hariri s Future Movement said on Thursday that Hariri s decision to wait instead of officially resigning from his post was a  wise step  that would allow for more dialogue. ",0
"Facebook Reportedly Complies With Pakistan’s Demand to Censor ’Blasphemy’ as Call to Hang Blasphemer Trends on Twitter - Breitbart The Islamic Republic of Pakistan has launched a crackdown against   “blasphemy” on social media, and Facebook and Twitter are doing little to stop it. According to government sources, Facebook is even assisting Pakistan in removing “blasphemous” content. [Late last week, government officials in Pakistan informed the Islamabad High Court that “almost 85 percent” of “blasphemous” material on Facebook had been taken down at the request of the government.  Facebook has yet to publicly confirm or deny this claim from the Pakistani government. However, earlier this month, Facebook  —   which claims to be “founded” on “principles of free expression,” dispatched a delegation to Pakistan to address the government’s demand for religious censorship. At the time of writing, Facebook did not reply to an inquiry from Breitbart News asking the company if they had removed “blasphemous” material to satisfy Pakistan. Pakistan, a   country which once harboured Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden within its borders, recently launched a crackdown on social media blasphemy. The country’s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif has ordered authorities to take urgent steps to remove blasphemous content on social media and apprehend those who post it. Last week, three Pakistani bloggers were arrested on suspicion of blasphemy, and had their laptops seized. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. Pakistan wants social media companies to help identify anonymous posters of blapshemous content, and has announced that it will seek the extradition of any Pakistanis who post blasphemous content from abroad. International affairs magazine The Diplomat has branded the   crackdown a “war on atheism. ” Meanwhile, on Twitter, a hashtag calling for the execution of one of the arrested “blapshemers,” ‘#HangAyazNizami,’ trended in Pakistan as Muslim users took to the platform to call for the blood of heretics.  Fuck with freedom of speech hang this fucker asap. 😏 #HangAyazNizami,  —   Sardar Waqar (@Engrr_vicky) March 25, 2017,  Call us terrorist or extremist or what everbut he must be hanged #hangayaznizami,  —   Daniyal Ahmed (@daniyalaahmed) March 25, 2017,  He must be drag in the streets then hanged #HangAyazNizami,  —   Nida Ahmed (@nidaa214) March 25, 2017,  Western Twitter users reacted strongly against the trend.

"Indonesia foreign minister flies to Bangladesh after Myanmar visit on Rohingya DHAKA (Reuters) - Indonesia s foreign minister will fly to Bangladesh on Tuesday for talks following her visit to Myanmar where she urged national leader Aung San Suu Kyi to end ongoing violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority there. Bangladesh s foreign secretary, Shahidul Haque, told Reuters Retno Marsudi will meet Bangladeshi officials in Dhaka. Nearly 90,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Aug. 25, following an army crackdown triggered by attacks by Rohingya insurgents in Buddhist-majority Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state. The Rakhine violence has killed at least 400 people, most of them Rohingya insurgents, according to the Myanmar government, leading to the exodus of Rohingya to neighbouring Bangladesh that is struggling to cope with the influx. Muslim-majority countries such as Indonesia and Turkey, who are trying to pressure Nobel peace prize winner Suu Kyi to end the crisis, are also offering help to Bangladesh deal with the massive inflow of people from across its 271 km (168 mile)long border with Myanmar.

"Trump says he and China's Xi to try to end opioid crisis BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be focusing  very strongly  on the U.S opioid crisis, which he has declared a public health emergency. Trump said shortly before arriving in Beijing he would discuss as a  top priority  stopping the  flood of cheap and deadly  fentanyl  manufactured in China  when he meets Xi.  Every year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,  Trump said in Beijing, standing next to Xi at the end of formal talks between the two.  Today President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,  he added.  A special emphasis will be placed on the new phenomenon - fentanyl - destroying lives by the millions. We re going to be focusing on it very strongly, the president and myself,  Trump said, without elaborating. Speaking later to reporters, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump and Xi agreed to take new steps.  On the critical issue of opioids, we made some good progress to curb the flow of harmful narcotics into the United States in order to save American lives,  Tillerson said.   The president committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information,  he added, referring to Xi. China s drug control agency last week disputed Trump s claim that most of the synthetic drug fentanyl at the heart of the U.S. opioid crisis was produced in China. Opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic drug 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl last year, surpassing common painkillers and heroin for the first time. American law enforcement agencies and drug control experts say most of the fentanyl distributed in the United States, as well as precursor chemicals, originate from China. While Chinese officials dispute these claims, Beijing has taken steps to crack down on the production and export of synthetic drugs, and has placed fentanyl and 22 other related compounds on its list of controlled substances.

"Campaigning in style: How Jeb Bush blew through his war chest   NEW YORK (Reuters) - There were stays at boutique hotels featuring rooftop pools, private soirees at members-only, jacket-and-tie clubs and fundraisers at the Four Seasons, the St. Regis and the Mandarin Oriental.      In the world of Jeb Bush, the campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination has at times been a whirl of private planes and high-end affairs, according to the federal filings of Bush’s campaign and his Super PAC, Right to Rise, which can raise unlimited funds for Bush as long as it does not coordinate directly with him.  It is not unusual for U.S. presidential candidates to fly private or even sometimes stay in luxury hotels. But some disgruntled donors say they are unhappy with Bush’s large outlays, which also include big spending on staff and tens of millions of dollars in ad buys.  Eleven of 16 major donors contacted by Reuters questioned whether it was money well spent, especially given how the one-time frontrunner has stumbled badly in the polls and is now facing questions about whether he should withdraw from the race.   In contrast to Bush, Senator Ted Cruz, who is running second in national polls of Republican voters, favors cheaper accommodation options like Holiday Inn and often flies on budget carriers, campaign finance filings through the third quarter show.  Several members of the Bush camp vigorously rejected the donor critiques. Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said, “We are running a national campaign that is competing everywhere and we have made investments that have allowed us to do what serious campaigns must do to be competitive in the primary and general elections.”  Ad-tracking firm SMG Delta says Bush’s campaign and Right to Rise have spent $82 million on ads, significantly more than the three leading candidates in the Republican race: Donald Trump ($5 million); Senator Ted Cruz ($11 million) and Senator Marco Rubio ($49 million). The tracking firm’s data is more up to date than what has been reported so far in the federal filings.  “There is no return on investment on the Bush ad buys, zero,” said one high-dollar donor who asked not to be named, pointing to how the ads have done little, at least so far, to lift Bush in the polls or dent his opponents.  On Sunday, donors will learn just how much Bush has spent from his $100 million-plus war chest. That’s when Republican and Democratic candidates and their Super PACs release their latest campaign finance reports. What is known so far is that Bush and Right to Rise spent at least $82 million, both in operating expenditures through the third quarter of 2015 and on ad spending through this month.    The campaign finance reports also show that between June 2015, when Bush formally announced his candidacy, and September, the Bush campaign spent $1.2 million on private planes versus the roughly $700,000 spent during the same period by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.      Cruz spent $158,000 on private planes, and Rubio $293,300. Trump flies around the country in his own Boeing 757.       The former Florida governor’s spending pattern illustrates the limits of campaign donations: Even in an era when candidates can receive unlimited sums from wealthy donors, money doesn’t guarantee success.      “They are burning money,” said a second major donor, who, like all the other high-dollar donors interviewed, asked not be named for fear of displeasing the Bush family.  “Look, this is not the election cycle to be spending like a silver-spoon Establishment candidate,” said a third donor. “It just doesn’t look right,” the donor said, referring to the way income inequality has emerged as a key theme in the 2016 election.  Ambassador Jeanne Phillips, a member of the Right to Rise governance committee, laughed off the criticism.  “I’ve known Jeb for 30 years, so the idea that Jeb would allow anyone around him to be frivolous with money is hilarious, it’s ridiculous. The man is the most conservative, fiscally responsible person I’ve ever worked with.”  Bush’s campaign committee paid for all lodging on the campaign trail and the vast majority of private air charter, while Right To Rise paid for nearly all the known ad spending.      Money donated by both large and small donors kept the Bush camp traveling in style. There were stays at luxury hotels including the Wilshire in Beverly Hills, the Viceroy in Florida, the St. Regis in Dana Point, California, and the W in Stamford, Connecticut, the campaign finance filings show.  The filings do not offer a complete picture. It is not clear for example, how many nights were spent at each of the hotels or indeed whether it was Bush himself who stayed or staff members.  Bush isn’t the only candidate spending at high-end hotels, but it’s a high proportion of his overall hotel spending. He spent $125,000,or 70 percent of his total hotel spending between June and September on hotels defined as luxury or “upper upscale” luxury hotels by STR Global, which tracks supply and demand data in the hotel industry.  Cruz and Rubio each spent less on luxury hotels and a smaller proportion of their overall lodging expenses on them, at roughly 56 percent and 61 percent, respectively, federal filings through the third quarter show. Trump flies home nearly every night so he can sleep in his own bed.      The Bush campaign and his Super PAC also spent more than $400,000 on renting facilities and catering at posh venues, including the Union League Club and the upscale beachfront 1 Hotel South Beach in Miami, where the Super PAC spent $60,000 last year. Rubio and Cruz spent roughly $265,000 and $185,000 respectively.      Bush defenders said the spending on high-end venues was simply how the donor world operated.  “If you can hold an event at a fancy hotel and raise millions, then it’s well worth holding it at a swanky hotel” said Charlie Spies, counsel for Right to Rise.  Spies said Right to Rise had negotiated “below market” rates with vendors and consultants, including an overall compensation cap for staff.        Nevertheless the Bush camp has spent more on staff and consultants than any of the leading candidates. Starting roughly in the spring, Bush paid out about $8 million. Cruz spent just $2 million; Rubio, just under $2 million; and Trump, $1.7 million.  Overall, Trump, Cruz, and Rubio have spent a small fraction of the $82 million Bush has reported paying out. Cruz spent $18.5 million and Rubio outlayed $32 million, according to the filings made so far.  Bush is certainly not the only candidate to spend big on the trail. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, for instance, ran an expensive campaign and burned through nearly $10 million before quitting after three months.      Bush’s prospects were far brighter last summer. Trump had yet to join the race and Bush was making headlines for the size of his war chest. His Super PAC had just cracked its goal of raising more than $100 million in just six months — an unprecedented haul in American politics.      To celebrate, Jeb’s parents and family welcomed their large network of well-heeled donors to their oceanside compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, where attendees were treated to rides in private trolley cars, lobster rolls and group photos with the sprawling Bush clan.  (This version of the story was refiled to clarify spending in paragraph 25 to show it was by both the campaign and Super PAC)  ",0
"Los Angeles Times Editorial Loses It over Trump: ’Narcissist,’ ’Demagogue’ - Breitbart The Los Angeles Times  —   which did its best, it admits, to ensure that President Donald Trump would not be elected  —   has printed a strident, and nearly hysterical, editorial in which it calls the Trump presidency a “train wreck. ”[Among other things, the Times states:  It was no secret during the campaign that Donald Trump was a narcissist and a demagogue who used fear and dishonesty to appeal to the worst in American voters. The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a “catastrophe. ” Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck.   …     In a matter of weeks, President Trump has taken dozens of   steps that, if they are not reversed, will rip families apart, foul rivers and pollute the air, intensify the calamitous effects of climate change and profoundly weaken the system of American public education for all.   …     What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself. He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind   so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. His obsession with his own fame, wealth and success, his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined, his craving for adulation  —   these traits were, of course, at the very heart of his   outsider campaign indeed, some of them helped get him elected. But in a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power, they are nothing short of disastrous. The editorial comes just days after Trump’s “unimaginable power” proved unable to force through a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

"Jury selection begins in Colorado theater shooting trial CENTENNIAL, Colo. — Gone are the orange hair and the thousand-yard stare. In their place, trimmed hair, a shaggy beard and red-framed glasses.

Sitting upright in court in a dark jacket, blue striped shirt and khaki slacks, James Holmes looking very much like the neuroscience graduate student he used to be, not a man on trial for his life.

But Holmes, now 27, faces 12 murder charges in connection with the summer 2012 massacre at a suburban Denver movie theater's midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises. He could be executed if convicted. Holmes also faces dozens of other charges, including attempted murder. At least 70 were wounded in the massacre.

Jury selection in the case began Tuesday afternoon, and Judge Carlos Samour said an initial pool of 9,000 jurors will be whittled down to 12, plus 12 alternates. The trial may last into October.

Once opening statements get underway, cameras will be allowed in the courtroom. However, they are not allowed during jury selection.

In a lengthy address to prosecutors and Holmes' defense team, Samour said he expects ""passionate and zealous"" courtroom arguments, but reminded both sides and prospective jurors that Holmes is innocent until proven guilty. The jury that will decide Holmes' guilt also will decide whether he should be executed.

""What's most important to me is that justice is done,"" said Samour. ""That's what this whole process is about: Justice.""

Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler wants Holmes put to death for the July 20, 2012, mass shooting in Aurora. He argues that life in prison is insufficient justice for the victims, survivors and their families.

By pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, Holmes admitted he committed the shooting but claims he's legally not responsible for his actions. He's undergone at least two mental-health evaluations at the state mental hospital, but the results have remained secret.

Holmes, then 24, was arrested at the scene by investigators who then discovered his apartment had been booby-trapped with explosives. His lawyers acknowledge Holmes, a former neuroscience doctorate student, was the lone shooter but say he was gripped by a psychotic episode.

Legal analyst Scott Robinson said insanity-plea cases are rare, and it's even more unusual for a jury to find someone not guilty by reason of insanity.

""It's a minuscule percentage ... yet the public perception is that people are getting off on the insanity plea all the time,"" said Robinson. ""It's actually a rare bird.""

In December 2014 — just as jury summons went out — Holmes' parents issued a public statement begging prosecutors to drop the death penalty and give their son a plea deal that would see him locked up and treated.

""We do not know how many victims of the theater shooting would like to see our son killed. But we are aware of people's sentiments,"" they wrote. ""We have read postings on the Internet that have likened him to a monster. He is not a monster. He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness.""",0
"Iraq says Iran has shut border with Kurdistan BAGHDAD/DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Sunday shut its border crossings with Iraq s Kurdistan in support of measures taken by the Iraqi government to isolate the Kurdish region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said.  At the request of the Iraqi government, the Islamic Republic of Iran closed today the border crossings with the Kurdistan region of Iraq,  the Iraqi foreign ministry said in a statement in Baghdad. Earlier in the day, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi had indirectly dismissed claims these crossings were shut.  As far as I know, nothing new has happened in this area,   the Iranian Students  News Agency (ISNA) quoted him as saying. An Iranian MP Mohammad-Javad Nobandegani said Tehran did not want to publicize the closing of the border.   There is no need for explicit publicity,  the MP was quoted as saying by Iran s ILNA news agency. The closure would negatively impact residents who depend on border trade, he said, adding that  national interests sometimes require us to act this way.  Iran last month halted flights to and from Kurdish regions in northern Iraq over the independence referendum by the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Tehran also carried out war games at the Kurdish border in September. Tehran fears the spread of separatism to its own Kurdish population, which is around 8 million. Iran backs Shi ite groups which have been ruling or holding key security and government positions in Iraq since the 2003 U.S-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein. ",0
"U.S. EPA employees protest Trump's pick to run agency WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former and current employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency expressed opposition to President Donald Trump’s pick to run the agency on Monday - in an open letter and a small street protest - reflecting divisions over the new administration’s plans to slash regulation. Over 400 former EPA staff members sent a letter to the U.S. Senate asking it to reject the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the agency’s new leader, saying “he has shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws.” In Chicago, around 30 employees of the EPA’s regional office there joined a protest organized by the Sierra Club environmental group and the American Federation of Government Employees to protest Pruitt’s nomination. Doug Eriksen, a spokesman for Trump’s transition team at the EPA, downplayed the Chicago protest, saying “employees have a right to take action on their private time.”     Trump has vowed to cut regulation to revive the oil, gas and coal industries, and has said he can do so without compromising air and water quality. He nominated Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times as Oklahoma’s top prosecutor to block its regulations, to run the agency, sparking alarm among Democrats and environmentalists. Last Thursday, the Senate environment committee approved Pruitt despite a boycott of his nomination by the panel’s Democratic members. He is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate, in Republican control after last November’s election, but a date for the vote has not been set.  The former EPA employees who sent the letter to the Senate wrote that they believed Pruitt has a history of siding with industry and has been reluctant to accept “the strong scientific consensus on climate change.” Employees at the Chicago rally raised concerns that Pruitt may cut employees and resources needed for the agency to enforce environmental regulations.  “The EPA needs to be able to enforce the rules when companies are breaking the law,” said Sherry Estes, an EPA lawyer who participated in the protest.

"#BlackLivesMatter: Why movement is its own worst enemy Editor's note: The following column appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.

#BlackLivesMatter is fast becoming its own worst enemy.

It lacks an agenda, it is antagonizing the black community’s top white political allies, including Democrats running for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination, and it is not finding common ground with any of the Republican majority in Congress.

The catalyst for the movement was outrage over the deaths of young black men like Freddie Gray, Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police officers who arguably used excessive, even deadly force. But where is the list of solutions to the injustices it so often decries?

The movement’s failure to get its collective act together carries real danger for the political clout of the African-American community in the 2016 elections and beyond.

With the movement potentially discouraging black American trust in Democrats, #BlackLivesMatter is increasing the odds of a sharp drop in black voter turnout in 2016. Already Democrats privately worry that without President Obama on the ballot, the black vote will decrease the turnout needed to keep the White House and win back the Senate.

That is more likely to happen if black voters get caught up in the anger that the BlackLives movement has directed at the political structure. The potential absence of black voters who have become discouraged — about a quarter of the nation’s Democrats — would be more devastating than any Republican plan to require voter identification, reduce the number of polling places in black neighborhoods or cut back on early voting.

When BlackLives activists denounce the Democratic National Committee for issuing a resolution in support of police reform, they are hurting themselves with party officials. When they say that all political parties try to “control or contain” black liberation, they are also damaging faith in the political system, especially among young people.

When they interrupt Democrats running for the presidential nomination, such as Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley, they are alienating longtime political allies and their supporters. When they videotape Hillary Clinton after she generously agrees to meet with them privately — in an apparent attempt to embarrass her — they are distancing themselves from the likely Democratic nominee. And imagine how local and state officials will react now to any request for a meeting with the group.

Meanwhile, they are not finding common cause with Latinos, even as immigrants are being attacked by the Republican candidates for the presidential election. Have you seen BlackLives interrupting Donald Trump’s events? Where is the outreach to Republicans?

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is one the most outspoken leaders in either political party on the racial inequities of prison reform. “I see an America where criminal justice is applied equally and any law that disproportionately incarcerates people of color is repealed,” he said in his announcement speech. If change is the goal, where is the alliance with the senator?

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor, has declared on the campaign trail that “the war on drugs has been a failure.” He told an audience last month “everyone makes mistakes” and that society needs to “reach out” and “embrace those people and say, ‘If you’re not a violent offender, if you’re not dealing drugs to our children, we need to get you treatment rather than prison.’ ”

Earlier this year, the Brennan Center for Law and Justice published a collection of essays highlighting the bipartisan consensus among national politicians that there is a need for sentencing reform, called Solutions: American Leaders speak out on Criminal Justice. Clinton, O’Malley, Paul, Christie and fellow presidential candidates Jim Webb, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio each penned essays for the Brennan Center on the need for reform.

And it’s not just those running for the Oval Office — leading congressional Republicans like Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Tea Party favorite Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) have all endorsed proposals to relax the federal sentencing laws. Grassley has said he wants to move on a bill this year to do just that.

A bipartisan bill, the Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Effective (SAFE) Justice Act authored by Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, has about three-dozen bipartisan co-sponsors in the House already. If #BlackLivesMatter protesters were chanting “Pass the SAFE Justice Act now!” they could find themselves in position to make significant change. Somehow they are blind to the opportunity.

It has been said that politicians see the light once they feel the heat. If only the energy and passion of #BlackLivesMatter protesters could be harnessed in something constructive rather than destructive.

Lobby Congress, hold voter registration drives, quiz candidates on their plan for sentencing reform, but don’t heckle the candidates and incite violence by calling for cop-killing. The movement could be critical to securing and mobilizing black support for criminal justice reform that actually would improve black lives.

I am reminded of something my father, who trained boxers, once told me.

He said even the best fighters know fear is like fire. It can cook your food and light your home. It can also burn your house down and kill you. The key to controlling fear or fire is turning it to a constructive purpose.

Now if only #BlackLivesMatter will harness its own fire into the urgent cause of criminal justice reform.

"U.S. House approves tighter North Korea sanctions WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved legislation on Thursday to tighten sanctions on North Korea by targeting its shipping industry and companies that do business with the reclusive state. The vote was 419 to 1. Supporters said the legislation was intended to send a strong message to North Korea, amid international concern over the escalation of its nuclear program. The measure would have to be approved by the Senate before it could be sent to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign into law. Although legislation addressing North Korea has been introduced in the Senate, there was no immediate word on when or if the Senate might take up a bill. Any new U.S. sanctions against North Korea would likely affect China, the North’s most important trade partner. While China has been angered by North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, it has signed up for increasingly tough U.N. sanctions against it, and says it is committed to enforcing them. Asked about the latest U.S. legislation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that China opposed other countries using their own domestic law to impose unilateral sanctions.  With the situation tense on the Korean Peninsula, all sides need to exercise restraint and not irritate each other to avoid the situation worsening, he said.   ",0
"Craig Sager, Colorful N.B.A. Sideline Reporter, Dies at 65 - The New York Times Craig Sager, an exuberant sideline reporter for National Basketball Association television broadcasts who was as well known for his outlandishly garish outfits as for the questions he asked coaches and players, died on Thursday in Atlanta. He was 65. The cause was leukemia, according to a spokesman for Turner Sports. After receiving the diagnosis in 2014, Mr. Sager continued to work occasionally during what became a highly public illness. He received blood transfusions to be strong enough to travel to some games, and returned to a hospital after others. He last appeared in a game broadcast in June and canceled plans to work for NBC at the Summer Olympics in Brazil in August to continue treatment. Mr. Sager brought deep knowledge of basketball and a   spirit to his work. He was known for working behind the scenes to find news that he could use in his   reports or give to announcing colleagues like Marv Albert and Reggie Miller. “He was always hovering around the benches,” Mr. Albert said in a recent telephone interview. “And players told him things. ” But his journalism competed for attention with his psychedelic wardrobe. He strode the sideline of N. B. A. arenas in lilac, orange, banana yellow, black and lime green outfits  —   some in medleys of colors arrayed in stripes, plaids, swirls and other patterns that resembled Rorschach tests. He abhorred repeating any combinations. “My clothes reflect who I am,” he wrote in “Living Out Loud: Sports, Cancer and the Things Worth Fighting For,” his autobiography, which was published in November. “I believe that life should be fun and so should your clothes. ” His ensembles set him apart from other sideline reporters, who are usually bit players on sports broadcasts, typically given no more than one or two minutes to question sweaty athletes and cranky coaches between quarters, at halftime or after games. But Mr. Sager, with questions as well planned as his ensembles, became a favorite of players and coaches, not to mention the fans in the seats, as he walked into an arena in his sartorial splendor. “He had a very good relationship with players, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t ask tough questions,” Mr. Albert said. “I also thought that the outfits he wore made him underrated. ” As his illness progressed, Mr. Sager had three bone marrow transplants, two from his older son, Craig II. On Mr. Sager’s return from a long hospital stay, his condition prompted Gregg Popovich, the San Antonio Spurs coach who is notoriously terse when responding to sideline reporters, to show rare warmth to Mr. Sager. “This is the first time I’ve enjoyed doing this ridiculous interview we’re required to do,” Mr. Popovich said, “and that’s because you’re here and you’re back with us. ” Then he added, “Now ask me a couple of inane questions. ” In June, Mr. Sager, who worked for TNT, was asked to be a sideline reporter at Game 6 of the N. B. A. finals on ABC, a rare invitation from a rival network. He scheduled the assignment  —   his first during a finals  —   between an   course of chemotherapy at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and a Father’s Day outing in Florida. Not surprisingly, he purchased a new outfit for the game. “I can’t bring out something I’ve already worn,” he said in an interview with The New York Times. “I want to make sure I don’t look down. I want people to say, ‘Man, he looks good. ’” After the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game 6, Mr. Sager interviewed the Cavaliers star LeBron James. After answering several questions, Mr. James reversed roles with Mr. Sager and asked: “How in the hell did you go   years without getting a finals game? That don’t make no sense. ” Mr. Sager smiled and said, “Thanks a lot for entertaining me. ” Craig Graham Sager was born on June 29, 1951, in Batavia, Ill. His father, Al, was an advertising and   executive his mother, Coral, was an avid golfer who held a pilot’s license. Mr. Sager attended Northwestern University, where, after trying out for the football team and playing for the freshman basketball team, he stepped into one of his earliest outrageous guises: Willie the Wildcat, the university’s mascot. After Northwestern’s football team upset Ohio State, Mr. Sager taunted the losing players while still in costume. In response, he wrote, members of the Ohio State marching band “began to push me and poke me with their flagpoles. ” After graduation he became a reporter for a radio station in Sarasota, Fla. On one assignment he leapt onto the field at   County Stadium after Hank Aaron hit his 715th home run to surpass Babe Ruth as baseball’s home run king. Wearing a trench coat, Mr. Sager, then 23, caught up to Mr. Aaron at home plate, amid a scrum of fans, reporters and relatives, to briefly interview him. Three years later, while covering the Belmont Stakes, Mr. Sager slept in Seattle Slew’s stable the night before the thoroughbred won the Triple Crown. Before leaving to take the horse for a morning walk, Mr. Sager wrote, he scooped up a piece of Seattle Slew’s excrement and preserved it for the next 39 years as a fragment of history. Mr. Sager also worked at TV stations in Florida and Kansas City, Mo. before joining CNN in 1981. In 1990 he moved to Turner Sports, where, besides the N. B. A. he covered golf, the National Football League, college football and basketball, and Major League Baseball. Mr. Sager is survived by his son Craig as well as another son, Ryan his daughters, Kacy, Krista and Riley Sager his second wife, Stacy and a sister, Candy Menzemer. Mr. Sager’s positive attitude and consuming desire to return to the sideline won him the Jimmy V Perseverance Award  —   named for Jim Valvano, the former North Carolina State basketball coach and ESPN commentator who died of bone cancer in 1993  —   at the ESPY Awards show in July. Wearing a floral print jacket, he said in his acceptance speech: “Whatever I might have imagined a terminal diagnosis would do to my spirit, it summoned quite the opposite  —   the greatest appreciation for life itself. So I will never give up, and I will never give in. ”",0
"Trump Labor Dept wants salary to count in overtime eligibility (Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department on Friday defended its authority to use salary levels to decide who was eligible for overtime pay but distanced itself from an Obama administration rule that greatly expanded the number of qualifying workers. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the Labor Department has continued to fight a challenge to an Obama administration-era rule to raise the pay threshold for overtime eligibility. But it has not endorsed the former administration’s move to nearly double that threshold, an increase strongly opposed by business groups.  The Labor Department told a federal appeals court on Friday it had the power to use salaries to set thresholds for mandatory overtime pay, without advocating for the $47,500 maximum salary level set by the department under Obama. The Labor Department is challenging a November decision from a federal judge in Texas that blocked the Obama rule, a decision that the department said could prevent it from setting a new threshold below that set by the Obama administration.  The Obama rule was expected to extend overtime pay eligibility to more than 4 million salaried workers. Nevada and 20 other states sued last year to block the rule. Business groups criticized the increase as too drastic and costly, potentially forcing employers to convert salaried workers to hourly wages. Trump’s Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta said during his confirmation hearing in March that the correct threshold might be around $33,000. The Labor Department took initial steps earlier this week to begin developing a new threshold. In its Friday brief to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, the Labor Department made it clear it did not support the salary threshold developed under Obama. But the department told the court it was “reluctant” to move forward with the rulemaking necessary to set a new threshold as long as its authority was in question. Nevada and the other states have said that the use of a salary threshold to determine overtime eligibility has been controversial for decades, but appeals courts allowed it because it had been set low enough to exempt management workers.  But the Obama administration rule is far more drastic, the states said, expanding overtime pay to tens of thousands of state employees. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, criticized the Labor Department’s handling of the appeal, saying in a statement that the administration “appears to be preparing to roll back overtime protections for millions of workers.” ",0
"Buffett hits back at Trump over tax comments (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett denied on Monday an allegation by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that he, like Trump, had taken “a massive deduction” that allowed him to avoid federal income taxes. Buffett said he paid about $1.85 million in income tax in 2015, and that returns for previous years were similar in respect to contributions, deductions and tax rates. Buffett said he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, but had “no problem” releasing his tax information. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing ongoing audits by the IRS. “I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13,” Buffett said in a statement, adding that “being a slow starter, I owed only $7 in tax that year.” Buffett, ranked the world’s third-richest person by Forbes magazine, said he had copies of all 72 of his returns “and none uses a carryforward.” Responding to an Oct. 1 New York Times story, Trump acknowledged during the presidential-candidates’ debate on Sunday that he had used investment losses to avoid paying taxes. Trump repeatedly said he was only taking advantage of tax provisions used by wealthy people who support Clinton. “I absolutely used it, and so did Warren Buffett ...”, he said. The Times reported that Trump’s declared loss of $916 million in 1995 was so large that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said his 2015 tax return showed adjusted gross income of $11,563,931. “My deductions totaled $5,477,694, of which allowable charitable contributions were $3,469,179. All but $36,037 of the remainder was for state income taxes,” he said. “The total charitable contributions I made during the year were $2,858,057,970, of which more than $2.85 billion were not taken as deductions and never will be. Tax law properly limits charitable deductions,” Buffett said. Buffett said he had no problem releasing his tax information while under audit.  “Neither would Mr Trump – at least he would have no legal problem.”  ",0

"Cuba urges U.S. not to politicize allegations of harmed diplomats UNITED NATIONS/HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba urged the United States on Friday to cooperate with its investigation into incidents that the U.S. says have harmed its diplomats in Havana and not to politicize the matter, days after Washington said it was considering closing its Cuban embassy. In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said the top level of the government in Havana had ordered an investigation into the mysterious matter, which threatens the fragile detente between the old Cold War foes. However, a Cuban government source told Reuters that the United States had provided no evidence of the harm, including hearing loss, dizziness and nausea, that it says U.S. diplomats and their relatives based in Havana have suffered. Cuban doctors had also not been allowed to examine anyone, the source said. A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Havana declined to comment.  The investigation to clarify this issue continues, and in order to be able to arrive to a conclusion, it will be crucial to count on the cooperation of the U.S. authorities,  Rodriguez told the U.N.  It would be unfortunate if a matter of this nature is politicized,  said Rodriguez. Cuba has denied any involvement in the affair. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was among five Republican senators that a week ago called for U.S. President Donald Trump to retaliate against Cuba by expelling its diplomats and possibly shuttering the U.S. embassy in Havana. Rubio helped forge Trump s new Cuba policy, rolling back parts of the detente achieved under Democratic former President Barack Obama and taking a harder line on the Communist-run island. Cuba s state-run media this week said the only party interested in a deterioration in relations were a small group of Republicans led by Rubio. The U.S. government in August first officially confirmed they were investigating the incidents it said began in late 2016. Several Canadians were also affected, a Canadian official said, further deepening the mystery. The last incident to affect a U.S. citizen occurred late in August, bringing the number of those with symptoms to 21, a U.S. State Department official said last week. Some of those had returned home for testing and treatment, the U.S. official said, while others had been tested in Cuba, where the embassy has a fulltime medical officer. Investigations by Cuba, the United States and Canada have yet to come up with any answers. Experts agree it is hard to see how any attacks could have been carried out or what the motivation could be. Theories abound, from surveillance technology gone awry to a sophisticated acoustic weapon in the hands of Cuban-American exiles or third-party state actors such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, but most flounder. Audiologists for example have raised doubt over the possibility of whether any sonic weapon exists that can be used covertly to bring about the range of symptoms mentioned by diplomats. ",0
"Federal Judge Blocks Indiana Abortion Law - The New York Times A federal judge on Thursday blocked an Indiana law that would have banned abortions based solely on a fetus’s disability or genetic anomaly, suggesting that it was an illegal limit on a woman’s   constitutional right. Judge Tanya Walton Pratt, of Federal District Court for Southern Indiana, also held up a state ban on abortions motivated solely by a fetus’s race or sex. In the preliminary injunction, Judge Pratt said limiting the reasons for an abortion was “inconsistent with the notion of a right rooted in privacy concerns and a liberty right to make independent decisions. ” While Judge Pratt’s injunction stops the law from taking immediate effect, and though she said the state would be unlikely to prevail at trial, the state can still defend the legislation. In a statement, the Indiana attorney general’s office said state lawyers would consider how to proceed and whether to appeal the injunction. Indiana would have been the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome. A handful of states have bans on abortion based on sex, one state has a ban based on race, and two have bans based on genetic anomalies, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit abortion rights group that tracks state laws. Judge Pratt’s decision, the first in a federal court to indicate that a ban on abortion because of genetic anomalies would likely be unconstitutional, is the latest setback for   groups. It comes days after a landmark Supreme Court ruling in a Texas case that two other kinds of restrictions  —   requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and imposing stringent   standards on abortion clinics  —   are unconstitutional. The Texas measures would have forced many clinics to shut down. In language that is expected to echo nationally, the Supreme Court held in its Monday ruling that the benefits of any such restrictions must be closely scrutinized and weighed against the burdens on women’s access to abortion. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement that “momentum from Monday’s landmark decision” was aiding in challenges to abortion restrictions in Indiana and elsewhere. “These unconstitutional laws punish women, and we will bring them down, law by law and state by state,” Ms. Richards said. “We have been fighting these restrictions on all fronts for years, organizing in the field, building for this moment  —   and now the wind is at our backs. ” Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Pence, said in a statement on Thursday that the governor was “disappointed” in the ruling and “remains steadfast in his support for the unborn, especially those with disabilities. ” Judge Pratt’s decision was also criticized in a statement by Indiana Right to Life, which noted that the jurist had been nominated by President Obama. That group’s chief executive, Mike Fichter, said the ruling “denied the civil rights of unborn children” and was “an appalling human rights injustice. ” Thursday’s case in Indiana was argued long before the new Supreme Court decision, and Judge Pratt’s opinion made no reference to it. Her ruling rested largely on the argument that the state, as established in a series of cases starting with Roe v. Wade in 1973, cannot impede a woman’s right to decide to have an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, usually at around 24 weeks. Judge Pratt said “irreparable harm” would have occurred had that part of the law taken effect as scheduled on Friday. “Difficult moral and complicated health decisions are made by women whose pregnancies are affected by a prenatal fetal anomaly,” Judge Pratt wrote in her ruling. “Given the relatively short time frame in which women may elect to terminate a pregnancy, even a short disruption of a woman’s ability to do so could have significant consequences. ” Indiana’s law, signed in March by Mr. Pence, was framed by abortion foes and legislative Republicans as a way to prevent discrimination in abortions, in particular the fetuses with Down syndrome. Mr. Pence, a Republican, said that he signed the law “with a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families. ” But the local chapters of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the measure, claiming the law posed an undue burden to women and restricted freedom of speech, and asking Judge Pratt for the preliminary injunction she issued on Thursday. That injunction also sets aside a portion of the law that imposed new restrictions for disposing of fetal remains. Indiana’s law was exceptional for its breadth, but the restrictions it included were not unprecedented. Such legislation has become more common and has gained traction in many   statehouses. Dawn Johnsen, an Indiana University law professor who has pushed for abortion rights, said Thursday’s injunction was an important step toward invalidating such legislation. “It’s very strong reaffirmation of the constitutional right as the Supreme Court has interpreted it, but applied to new, creative, harmful restrictions,” Ms. Johnsen said. The Indiana measure had been controversial from the start, and Mr. Pence waited until his deadline before signing it into law. In the weeks that followed, abortion rights supporters rallied outside the Capitol against the law and started an online “Periods for Pence” campaign that encouraged women to tell the governor about their reproductive health.",0
"In China, Property Frenzy, Fake Divorces and a Bloating Bubble - The New York Times SHANGHAI  —   Zheng Ruizhen counted herself among the last holdouts on Lufeng Road. Even as   sprang up in recent years to surround her dilapidated home, Ms. Zheng, a    schoolteacher, and her husband, Sun Guojian, held firm. He grew up there. Her school was a   bicycle ride away. They raised their son there, though he eventually grew so tall that his head grazed the ceiling of his cramped room. When city officials pushed them to sell, they said no. Then came China’s latest property bubble  —   a frothy surge in prices that could have global repercussions if it pops. In August, an unremarkable piece of land around the corner from Ms. Zheng sold for nearly $2, 000 a square foot, a national record and nearly three times the average land price in Manhattan. Local officials grew more insistent and threatened to tear down their bathroom. Finally, they relented, and Ms. Zheng’s husband signed away the home for a price to be determined later. Then, on Oct. 9, Mr. Sun died of a heart attack, something Ms. Zheng said was perhaps influenced by stress over the pending demolition of their home. Now, as she grieves, she is waiting to hear how much the Shanghai government will offer in compensation  —   but however much that is, she knows it will not be enough for her to be able to afford to live anywhere close to Lufeng Road. Said Ms. Zheng: “I never expected housing prices in Shanghai would get this high. ” China is in the midst of a dizzying housing bubble. Shanghai’s average housing price is up nearly   from a year ago, with prices in major cities like Beijing and Guangzhou not far behind. Chinese consumers are rushing to buy homes before the government steps in with restrictions. When rumors swept through Shanghai that the government would require homeowners to pay more in taxes and down payments to buy additional properties, many couples filed for divorce so that one partner could still be treated as an independent buyer. China has experienced housing booms and busts before. And fervor for real estate among the wealthiest Chinese has already spread far beyond the country’s borders, from Long Island mansions to disused ranches in Texas  —   many to get their money out of the country. But economists warn that the current boom on the Chinese mainland could be extra difficult to resolve: It comes with a growing amount of   debt.   household loans  —   mostly mortgages  —   have doubled as a share of total official bank lending this year. They accounted for about 40 percent of all new loans in August, contrasted with just 20 percent at the start of the year. The value of new home loans as a percentage of all housing sales has surged to a record high. The loans  —   largely a byproduct of a flood of Chinese lending to keep the economy growing  —   are helping the affluent, the middle class and low earners who have dreamed of owning a home, while investors and speculators are piling in, too. Underground lenders  —   those who operate outside the formal banking system using a variety of new platforms  —   are also helping to feed the boom. Last month, economists at the Bank of China warned in a report that worsening asset price bubbles were adding to a frothy market that could result in trouble. The day before, Wang Jianlin, a politically connected property and entertainment magnate who is one of the country’s richest people, told CNN that China property was “the biggest bubble in history. ” That could be bad news for the global economy. Many economists estimate that housing and related areas  —   like construction, cement manufacturing or furniture making  —   account for roughly   of China’s economic activity. But if the bubble pops, that support could disappear quickly. Chinese officials, apparently mindful of the 2008 American housing bust, appear to be aware of the risks of a   property bubble. But some economists worry they will be too slow to rein it in. “The risk is that the government is late in cooling the market, the rally spreads to more areas, pushing up household leverage and construction activity, pushing the bubble bigger, which is then followed by a bigger downward correction,” said Tao Wang, the head of China economics at UBS in Hong Kong. Local regulators are already trying to cool things down. In the last few weeks, local authorities have accelerated efforts to tighten housing markets in up to 20 Chinese cities, according to economists at China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank. But in many cases these steps have only added to the rush, as home buyers move in while they can. By her account, Zhang Xia and her husband have enjoyed a happy marriage. Then the rumor swept the city that Shanghai authorities would make it harder for couples with one home to buy more. On a recent Monday, Ms. Zhang, a    resident of Shanghai’s Huangpu area, and her husband sat waiting at a local marriage registry office to file for divorce. Shanghai officials continue to deny that they will limit house buying by couples, but Ms. Zhang is among many who do not believe them. “We know the government said this is a rumor, but they also said that a few times before, when the rumor actually came true,” Ms. Zhang said. “Some people even said the fact that the government said it’s a rumor means it’s going to be true. ” Shanghai, China’s financial capital, is at the heart of the property boom. Demand there is so intense that developers now commonly require sizable deposits of cash just to join a lottery to buy a new apartment. Only holders of winning numbers will be offered the chance to buy a unit. One flashy new development in central Shanghai charges a refundable 200, 000 renminbi, or $30, 000, to enter its lottery. “In Shanghai now,” said Wang Jie, a sales manager there, “it’s not like you can buy an apartment just because you have money. ” Back on Lufeng Road, the recently widowed Ms. Zheng and her neighbors try to go about their lives despite the boom going on around them. Men and women play   near a   house, one of a number of dwellings along the road in various states of disassembly, like a row of rotting teeth. Stray dogs sunbathe and alley cats hunt around piles of red bricks and wooden beams scattered on the street. In recent months, local officials hung red propaganda banners on people’s housing extolling the benefits of selling out. “No more hesitation means no more disappointment,” reads one. Says another: “Requisition and compensation are lawful. Smart alecks will regret it later. ” “Look at those banners,” Ms. Zheng said, shaking her head. “It’s almost like the Cultural Revolution once again. ” Earlier, local officials told Ms. Zheng that the land where her home stands would be used to build supporting facilities for the   complex of   built by China Vanke, the country’s largest property developer. “They said that when people who live in the   in Vanke look down, the view from their windows is our ugly roofs,” she said. “So they have to get rid of us. ”",0
"Far right wants Austria to join group of anti-immigrant states VIENNA (Reuters) - The far right Freedom Party (FPO), set to become kingmaker after elections on Oct. 15, wants Austria to join the Visegrad Group of central and east European states opposed to immigration. Eurosceptic leaders in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have refused migrant quotas approved by a western-dominated majority of European Union member states. They also reject proposed European Union reforms that would transfer more power from national governments to Brussels institutions.  The FPO, likely to be a part of Austria s next ruling coalition, also wants a more decentralized EU.  We will ... strengthen contact with the Visegrad states and it would be nice and good if we could maybe even become a member of the Visegrad Group,  FPO chief Heinz-Christian Strache said in an election debate with Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern focusing on curbing migrant flows and Brussels  powers. The Freedom Party and center-left Social Democrats are fighting for second place in Sunday s election with both commanding about 25 percent of the vote in the latest polls. The Freedom Party appears ticketed for a place in the next coalition given that the conservative People s Party s rating of around 33 percent is unlikely to improve enough for an absolute majority, and bitter disputes between the two centrist parties. Conservative leader Sebastian Kurz has, like Strache, praised far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for building a border fence to keep migrants out of EU territory.  To avoid losing votes, Austria s mainstream conservatives have drifted recently towards the FPO s anti-immigration positions and joined calls to shrink and refocus the EU s powers. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, the EU executive, has invited Visegrad Group leaders to a meeting on Oct. 18 to try to ease tensions between them and wealthier western Europe.

"Americans Don't Like New Congress Any Better Than The Last One Since last year, Americans have grown increasingly positive about jobs, the direction of the country and even the president -- but they're not yet willing to extend the same goodwill to Congress.

Just 16 percent of Americans approve of Congress, according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday. That's up from a 9 percent low during the 2013 government shutdown, but virtually unchanged since the end of last year.

""Congress' poor track record notwithstanding, there is reason to believe this Congress will at least be rated more popularly going forward than the last two divided Congresses,"" Gallup's Andrew Dugan wrote. ""Typically, elections that hand control of Congress to one party provide an initial uptick in support for the new Congress.""

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that most Americans think Congress is worse than it used to be, with a majority saying it is less civil and more divided than it was a decade ago.

A 52 percent majority of Americans say congressional debates are less civil than they were 10 years ago, and 58 percent say Congress is now more divided along party lines. Americans 45 and older were the most likely to say things had devolved.

Ironically, the woes of Congress are something partisan Americans can agree on: Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to say Congress is worse today.

But while ratings for Congress remain low, Americans feel at least relatively warmer toward their own representatives. Twenty-six percent of Americans approve of the member representing their district, while another 26 percent disapprove and the remaining 47 percent are neutral or unsure.

Republicans were by far the most satisfied, giving their representatives a net +17 approval rating, compared to a net -8 among independents and a net +3 among Democrats.

Americans historically have been much more positive about their own representatives than about Congress as a whole, although the percentage who said they felt their own member should be re-elected dipped to a near-historic low in 2014.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Jan. 6-8 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.

"White House: ‘Sad’ That Susan Rice Not Transparent in Unmasking Investigation - Breitbart The White House again hit former National Security Adviser Susan Rice for refusing to testify to Congress regarding allegations that she “unmasked” the identities of Trump campaign aides during the 2016 election. [“I do think that it’s sad that she has chosen not to be transparent in this process,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters during the press briefing on Friday.  Sanders added that it was up to Congress whether or not they should subpoena Rice, but that the White House was confident in the investigation. Rice declined a request from the Sen. Lindsey Graham to testify in the investigation into interference in the United States presidential election. “While Ambassador Rice commends the Subcommittee’s efforts to examine this matter of extraordinary national significance, it is extremely rare for the Congress to request the testimony of a former senior advisor to the President,” a letter from Rice’s lawyer read to the committee, citing “separation of powers” concerns. President Donald Trump also reacted to the news, calling it “not good. ”",0
"Leon Cooperman, a Billionaire Charged With Insider Trading, Prepares to Fight - The New York Times Leon G. Cooperman, one of the early titans of the hedge fund industry, is gearing up for the biggest fight of his career: preserving his Wall Street legacy as regulators accuse him and his   firm of insider trading. The stakes are high, too, for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which on Wednesday sued Mr. Cooperman, a    billionaire, accusing his firm, Omega Advisors, of reaping $4 million in illegal profit by using nonpublic information about an energy deal in 2010. The case is the most prominent to be brought by the agency since a court ruling that narrowed the definition of insider trading. Hours after the civil complaint was filed, Mr. Cooperman fired back with a detailed   rebuttal sent to investors. He followed with a defiant conference call, opening with an   joke about an    man bragging about having sex with an    woman. He told investors on the call that he had refused to settle and that he would fight the S. E. C. in court. The stage is set for what is expected to be a    legal battle between a gruff, outspoken investor and an agency that has come under criticism for not taking more cases to trial. Mr. Cooperman, the son of a South Bronx plumber, is known for not holding back. In 2011, he wrote a much publicized “open letter” accusing President Obama of “villainizing the American dream” and the wealthy. “It took me 50 years of hard work and playing by the rules to get where I got. I’m not going to let these people destroy my legacy,” Mr. Cooperman told investors on Wednesday. Regulators contend that Mr. Cooperman used his position as one of the biggest shareholders in Atlas Pipeline Partners to gain confidential information from an unidentified executive at the company about the sale of one of its   facilities to another energy company in July 2010. Mr. Cooperman had assured the executive that he would not trade on the information, but regulators said that despite making that promise, he had his firm accumulate a bigger position and profited when Atlas’s stock jumped 31 percent after the sale was announced. The case also involves some family drama. Mr. Cooperman’s timely trades indirectly benefited a grandson, whose account Mr. Cooperman managed. Regulators said the money manager bought an Atlas Pipeline bond that rose in value after the deal. And in another twist, Mr. Cooperman’s son, Wayne, who runs another hedge fund, may get drawn into the fray because of his own trading in the same stock. In his letter, Mr. Cooperman said his son was prepared to testify on his behalf, noting that his son’s fund, Cobalt Capital Management, was betting against shares of Atlas Pipeline at the time and he is one of the biggest investors in his son’s firm. Mr. Cooperman said he did not share any information about the sale of the   facility with his son. In the complaint, however, the S. E. C. quoted an email that Mr. Cooperman sent to an unidentified relative  —   described as the manager of another hedge fund  —   informing him of the   $682 million deal. This same relative may have been the first to have sounded the alarm about unusual trading in shares and options of Atlas Pipeline the day the deal was announced, according to the S. E. C. In a separate email, the relative writes to an executive at Atlas Pipeline, calling the options trading before the sale announcement “fishy” and “shady. ” The relative goes on to say that “somebody should investigate” and then asks: “How do I become a  . ” Mr. Cooperman’s son did not return a phone call seeking comment. But his firm did buy shares in Atlas Pipeline later in 2010, according to regulatory filings. Wayne Cooperman has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Regulators also contended that Mr. Cooperman tried to conceal his actions after Omega received a subpoena relating to the Atlas trades some 17 months later by contacting one of Atlas’s executives in an attempt to “fabricate” a cover story in the event that either man was questioned by regulators about the trade. Mr. Cooperman “allegedly undermined the public confidence in the securities markets and took advantage of other investors who did not have this information,” Andrew J. Ceresney, the S. E. C. ’s chief of enforcement, said in a statement. The civil case against Mr. Cooperman, filed in the Federal District Court in Philadelphia, would appear to sidestep a monkey wrench thrown into some insider trading prosecutions by a recent appellate court decision. That ruling made it more difficult to charge someone with insider trading if the person improperly leaking confidential information was not getting a personal benefit of some consequence. The personal benefit issue would not seem to arise in this matter because regulators contend that Mr. Cooperman “misappropriated” the confidential information about the impending sale from the unidentified executive at Atlas Pipeline. Ted Wells and Daniel Kramer, his lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison, issued a statement in which they called the allegations “entirely baseless. ” Mr. Cooperman said he was being charged with trading on paper gains and added that his firm never sold shares after the deal was announced. He said much of the firm’s trading was related to   positions in a stock that the firm had been bullish on for many years. In some insider trading cases, hedge fund managers have been forced to shut their firms and return money to investors. On Wednesday, Mr. Cooperman emphasized that 35 percent of Omega Advisors’ $5. 4 billion in assets under management belonged to members of the firm and that business would continue as usual. He added, however, that if the firm concluded that the S. E. C. case had “become too much of a distraction,” it would voluntarily give back money. Omega is the second large hedge fund to be rocked by an insider trading investigation this year. In June, securities regulators and federal prosecutors charged a top manager at Visium Asset Management with insider trading. The manager, Sanjay Valvani, committed suicide a week later. Visium’s founder, Jacob Gottlieb, whom the authorities did not charge, is in the process of shuttering the hedge fund after selling some of its funds to AllianceBernstein. The two cases show that insider trading remains an issue in the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund industry even after a sweeping crackdown by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. That push led to convictions and guilty pleas from more than 80 people, including Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire   of the Galleon Group. Another firm, SAC Capital Advisors, a   $14 billion hedge fund, pleaded guilty to insider trading and paid $1. 8 billion in fines to federal authorities. In the civil complaint on Wednesday, the S. E. C. also accused Mr. Cooperman of failing to report in a timely manner information about his hedge fund’s holdings and other transactions in publicly traded companies in violation of federal securities laws more than 40 times. Regulators said Mr. Cooperman “repeatedly violated” federal securities laws requiring investors to disclose when their equity interest in a publicly traded company rises above either a 5 or 10 percent stake. Speaking at a private charity event in June at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan, Mr. Cooperman addressed the looming investigation, telling the Wall Street audience, “I call companies, that’s what I do for a living. ” He said: “Every time I speak with a company I say the same thing: Don’t disenfranchise me if I ask you a question. Don’t answer a question if you’re not prepared to give anyone else that information, just tell me it’s confidential and we’ll move on. ”",0
"The White House insists it has a plan to fight Islamic State and that it’s working To its critics, President Obama’s strategy to combat the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq is weak and incoherent. Even some of the staunchest U.S. allies and partners in the fight worry that the time for what they see as the administration’s incremental approach has long since passed.

The White House maintains that its strategy is comprehensive and that it’s working. Sharp increases in airstrikes and Obama’s recent decision to deploy Special Operations troops, officials say, are part of a fundamental change in the military’s mission developed this fall, along with a new diplomatic push to end the distraction of Syria’s civil war.

In his Sunday-night address to the nation following last week’s San Bernardino, Calif., shooting, Obama outlined the elements of the strategy, assuring Americans that there is a viable plan underway to decimate the Islamic State where it lives. “We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us,” he said, using an alternative name for the militants.

But the White House is clearly frustrated by its failure to communicate the elements of that plan and what it believes has been accomplished.

“Yes, there is a strategy,” Secretary of State John F. Kerry snapped in a speech Saturday. “I know the criticism. We all hear them. . . . But that doesn’t mean it’s wisdom.”

The administration’s insistence that its prudence and patience will pay off — vs. charges of too little, too late — have been the two opposing narratives of the 18-month battle against the Islamic State and the four-year Syrian war it has now overshadowed.

An examination of the recent course of events on the military and diplomatic fronts and interviews with a broad range of stakeholders and experts provide fuel for both arguments.

For more than a year after the Islamic State blitzkrieg swept across Syria and through Iraq to the Baghdad suburbs in the early summer of 2014, U.S. military operations, including airstrikes and training of local ground troops, were in what a coalition spokesman, Col. Steve Warren, called “crisis mode, just trying to keep the barbarians off the gate.”

The Iraqi army had fallen apart. In Syria, as civil war raged in the west, the militants consolidated their control over the north-central and eastern areas of the country, with virtually free access to Syria’s border with Turkey to infiltrate tens of thousands of foreign fighters and equipment.

Airstrikes begun by the United States and its coalition partners — Europeans in Iraq and Arab states in Syria — were tactical, focused on targets of opportunity and the need to prevent collapse. While domestic critics and allies in the region called for more strikes, more support for Syrian rebels, more U.S. boots on the ground and no-fly zones, the administration demurred.

In a broad assessment in August, the Pentagon determined it had succeeded in its initial goals of stopping further Islamic State expansion and reestablishing the foundations of a viable Iraqi military. Amid repeated failures in Syria to organize and arm a rebel force to fight against the militants in Syria, it found hope in the establishment of a Syrian Kurdish and Arab force that has driven the militants from much of the Turkish border.

Adoption of what the military says is its first real operational strategy, following the chaos of the initial year, was marked by September’s change of command of the Baghdad-based headquarters of the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. “You have done what was necessary,” U.S. Central Command Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III told departing Lt. Gen. James L. Terry.

The new commander, Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, was charged with “operationalizing” the mission, Warren said.

“We always wanted to get into a position where we could apply multiple points of pressure at once, across the whole battle space,” said a senior administration official. “We’re now in position to actually do it. It’s not going to be perfect, it’s not going to be linear, it’s going to be extremely hard.”

Military and administration officials, most speaking on the condition of anonymity about internal decision-making, listed the elements of the comprehensive offensive against “core ISIL” on the ground in both Syria and Iraq.

In Iraq, the focus has been on cutting Islamic State supply lines into Mosul, the militant bastion in the northwest, in preparation for an eventual ground assault, and applying simultaneous pressure along militant front lines stretching south to the city of Ramadi, 70 miles west of Baghdad. “These are not blitzkrieg gains,” Warren said, “but painstaking, incremental work against a dug-in enemy” now made more effective with the ability to integrate airstrikes with a more organized and robust ground force.

Obama has authorized a new, Iraq-based Special Operations task force to conduct ground raids against Islamic State leadership targets in both Iraq and Syria. Administration officials have described a snowballing cycle in which more raids will take more leaders off the battlefield and provide more intelligence to plan still more raids. But it is unclear when the force, initially to number about 100, will be deployed.

Syria, with its separate wars against the Islamic State and between forces of President Bashar al-Assad and rebels seeking to unseat him, is far more complicated.

Regional allies such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, who once flew strike missions along with U.S. warplanes, have largely dropped out, an absence the United States hopes to make up with new agreements with France and Britain.

The “whole battle space” concept includes simultaneous airstrikes along the eastern border with Iraq to further cut militant supply lines, on Islamic State-controlled oil fields, and in the north-central area, where Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces who have captured a wide swath of territory along the border from the militants are organizing to attack the de facto militant capital of Raqqa.

Obama has authorized the deployment of 50 Special Operations troops, the first official U.S. boots on the ground in Syria, to join those forces to assess their readiness and help develop tactical plans, although the Americans are not expected to arrive for several months, defense officials said.

In southern Syria, anti-Assad rebels have met with significant success against government forces, but the Islamic State, sensing an opening, has begun moving into the area. The United States is sending more money and equipment, including heavy, long-range artillery, to Jordan, both to protect its own border and to engage militant targets inside Syria.

But given the new threat to the homeland, the administration’s claims of incremental success have left scornful critics asking why it does not do more. Asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday what he hoped to hear in Obama’s speech, presidential hopeful Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) replied: “That he’s going to change his strategy and come up with a regional army to go in destroy the caliphate in Raqqa. . . . The president doesn’t have a strategy.”

Mutual frustration has also been ongoing between the United States, as coalition leader, and regional allies, with some calling for a more aggressive U.S. policy. The United Arab Emirates said last week that it was willing to send ground forces into Syria — something Obama has consistently refused — if others would do the same as part of an international force.

But the region’s governments, including Turkey, are also deeply divided among themselves, leaving the administration as both whipping boy for their complaints and mediator for their disagreements as it tries to implement a broad strategy. In recent weeks, as Kerry has launched a diplomatic effort to bring the civil war to an end in order to shift attention to the counterterrorism fight, Obama himself has intervened in a series of conversations with regional leaders, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi King Salman.

Nowhere is the dissention more acute than in northwest Syria, where rebel groups separately backed by the United States and Europe, the Persian Gulf Arab states and Turkey are locked in a melange of battles, often beside forces of al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, against Assad’s military.

The entry of Russian warplanes and Iranian troops on Assad’s side in western Syria has further complicated the situation, increasing the conundrum of how to take back the nearby, remaining 60-mile strip of the Syria-Turkey border in Islamic State hands.

The coalition has said it is ready to launch an all-out air offensive to drive the militants out of the area, located north of Aleppo, Syria’s most-populous city, but not until there are opposition forces on the ground ready to occupy the terrain. And the more the rebels are engaged in the Russian-aided fight against Assad, the less willing they are to switch their attention to the border.

U.S. officials say that a small force of opposition fighters in the area, including about 130 Syrians trained by the Americans in Jordan who are in direct communication with U.S. forces, have had some success. But their operations are still rudimentary. To delineate their lines from those of the Islamic State and avoid their own casualties from coalition airstrikes, they light tires on fire and warn pilots to avoid the smoke.",0
"Japan's 'Dennis Rodman', ex-wrestler Inoki, urges lower tensions over North Korea TOKYO (Reuters) - The standoff over North Korea could lead to  nuclear war , a Japanese pro-wrestler turned lawmaker warned on Wednesday, urging nations to dial down the tension after the isolated country fired a missile over northern Japan last month. Tokyo could play a role in mediating with its neighbor, said the 74-year-old Antonio Inoki, who is known for fighting boxer Muhammad Ali four decades ago.  We are seeing a situation where each raises his fist and the situation is escalating,  Inoki, who recently returned from his 32nd visit to Pyongyang, told a news conference, wearing his signature red scarf.  It s important to see who can be the first to lower his fist and reduce the tension,  said Inoki, who, like U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman, has made numerous visits to North Korea. Pyongyang must commit to denuclearization as a prerequisite for talks, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in an interview with the Nikkei business daily published on Wednesday.  On Monday, the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on the North over its sixth nuclear test. During meetings with North Korea s top diplomat Ri Su Yong and others on his visit, Inoki proposed that Japan s ruling Liberal Democratic Party send a delegation to Pyongyang, perhaps as a first step toward a visit by Abe, he added.  I did make the proposal and was told they would be happy to receive such a delegation,  said Inoki, who strode into the news conference as if entering the ring, his theme song blaring. Inoki said he sensed more LDP members were beginning to think dialogue was needed, but admitted the hurdle to an Abe visit was high.  Abe and other Japanese officials have said now was the time for pressure, not dialogue. The square-jawed, 1.9-metre- (6-foot-three-inch-) tall Inoki developed close ties with North Korea because his mentor, pro-wrestling legend Rikidozan, hailed from North Korea but could never go home. First elected to parliament s upper house in 1989 from his  Sports and Peace Party , Inoki made headlines the next year when he went to Iraq during the Gulf War and intervened on behalf of Japanese hostages, who were subsequently released. Inoki was elected again in 2013 as an independent. Like Rodman, he says it is vital to maintain lines of communication with the isolated North.   It s important to keep the door open,  Inoki said.

"Juncker: grab Brexit chance to forge a tighter EU STRASBOURG (Reuters) - European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker urged European Union governments on Wednesday to use economic recovery and Brexit as springboards toward a closer union, built on an expanded euro zone and a pivotal role in world trade. In his annual State of the European Union speech, Juncker  sketched out a vision of a post-2019 EU where some 30 countries would be using the euro, with an EU finance minister running key budgets to help states in trouble. Tax and welfare standards would converge and Europe, not the United States, would be the hub of a free-trading world. The EU chief executive stressed his wish to heal divisions between eastern and western states. He sees that as vital to countering a drive, including by founding powers France and Germany, to set up new structures within the bloc that would exclude some poorer, ex-communist members in the east.  The wind is back in Europe s sails,  Junker told the European Parliament, citing economic growth and the easing of a succession of crises   Greek debt, refugee inflows, the rise of eurokcepticism reflected in Brexit - that seemed to threaten the EU s survival.  Now we have a window of opportunity, but it will not stay open for ever,  he said, emphasizing a need to move on from and even profit from the British vote to leave the bloc in 2019.  We will keep moving on because Brexit isn t everything, it is not the future of Europe,  he said in a speech that Brexit supporters said showed they were right to take Britain out of a bloc set on creating more powerful, central institutions French, German and eastern European officials made positive comments, but several said Juncker would face stiff opposition.  In a carefully balanced, hour-long discourse in Strasbourg, he called on nationalist eastern leaders   though not by name   to stop defying EU courts over civil rights, and on westerners to drop attempts to keep out cheaper eastern workers or palm off inferior food in poorer national markets. But his core proposal for countering what is known as a  multispeed Europe  by encouraging all states to join the euro and other EU structures faces resistance in both non-euro zone countries and potentially in Paris and Berlin, where the newly elected President Emmanuel Macron and about-to-be-re-elected  Chancellor Angela Merkel are readying their own plans. Macron plans to present his ideas for reforming the 19-nation euro zone on Sept. 26, two days after the German election, a French diplomatic source said. EU officials hope leaders may discuss the issues at a dinner on Sept. 28 before a summit in Estonia.  If we want the euro to unite rather than divide our continent, then it should be more than the currency of a select group of countries,  Juncker said.  The euro is meant to be the single currency of the European Union as a whole.  He noted that only long-standing EU members Britain and Denmark have a legal right not to adopt the euro. EU officials say that with Britain leaving, and the eight remaining non-euro states accounting for only 15 percent of EU GDP, Juncker sees it as natural for EU and euro zone policy to operate in unison. For that reason, he rejected proposals, led by France, for a special euro zone budget, finance minister and parliament. These functions, he said, should be filled instead by a vice president of the Commission, chairing the Eurogroup of 19 euro zone finance ministers and managing a euro zone budget that would be part of the budget for the whole EU, overseen by Parliament. While Denmark in fact pegs its crown closely to the euro, a drive to push the likes of Poland and Sweden into the euro would be a hard sell in those countries, while Germany, France and others have been skeptical about letting poorer states join yet. Juncker proposed EU funding and technical help to encourage non-euro members to get themselves into a position to join. For Juncker, officials say, the departure of Britain, for all the difficulties it brings, means goodbye to the major power that has continually sought opt-outs from new integration projects, and offers an opportunity to end the habit for good.  Everyone should be in everything,  one senior official said. An aide to Macron said Juncker had made  many ambitious proposals  in line with French ideas and played down divergence on euro zone reform, noting Juncker would offer final ideas only in December. In Germany, government officials were restrained. But Beate Merk, a regional minister in Bavaria allied to Merkel, said expanding the euro to the whole EU would be  a risky experiment that would greatly heighten Europe s problems . Euroskeptics responded critically to the Commission president s speech. Ryszard Legutko, an EU lawmaker from Poland s right-wing ruling party, warned against responding to problems with  the same old  more Europe, more Europe  arguments.  That is not the answer,  he said.  We need to get the EU s house in order before there can even be a discussion on centralizing even further.  Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party said:  All I can say is, thank God we re leaving.  Farage s allies cheered when Juncker finally mentioned Brexit near the end of his speech and said the British would come to regret their  tragic  referendum decision to leave. Looking ahead to March 30, 2019, the day when Britain will be out of the EU, Juncker said he had proposed that Romania, which will then hold its rotating presidency, should host a summit in the formerly German-speaking Transylvanian city of Sibiu. There leaders should set out plans for a more united Union, two months before voters elect a new European Parliament. ",0

You have a big choice between these two systems. The big choice between rail vs. electric means electric cars will be cheaper because it will bring a greater choice and not pay for a rail system at all.

The best thing that rail can do for us is give us a good choice of transportation over time. It could be free public transit (in which case, for me, free public transit will be quite convenient because I know I will be able to commute wherever I wish on the subway, which is great. For many people, however, rail is just a way of getting around in the dark. If you are on public transit, then that service is often inadequate. Your commute would be much more convenient if the cars were faster and more reliable) or it could be a new mode of transportation (that is, electric cars for the first few years after electrification because it is cheaper to maintain.

Dallas police confirmed to KERA, 90.3 FM, that there is no immediate threat to the public.

Investigators are looking across Texas to determine whether sexual misconduct occurred.

The suspect is believed to have crossed the border with five others Friday, before authorities said they had the suspect and six others arrested.

The suspect reportedly confessed he was an ex-felon from Germany, authorities said, while saying he would never commit sexual assault.

Two of the remaining suspects were detained Saturday and faces charges of drug and gun charges.

"SATAN 2: Russia unvelis an image of its terrifying new ‘SUPERNUKE’ – Western world takes notice The RS-28 Sarmat missile, dubbed Satan 2, will replace the SS-18 Flies at 4.3 miles (7km) per sec and with a range of 6,213 miles (10,000km) The weapons are perceived as part of an increasingly aggressive Russia It could deliver a warhead of 40 megatons – 2,000 times as powerful  as the world bomb – to targets over the next few years. And the missiles can stay deployed long enough to damage satellites, ICBMs and aircraft up to 500 times faster than traditional atomic weapons The Russian Navy will not need to launch a warhead from its submarine base in the Mediterranean Sea to defend its territory From there, the missiles will be launched from coastal regions in the western Mediterranean Sea and from its eastern naval base in the Black Sea, with the option of launching from the eastern Mediterranean sea. Russia has previously conducted tests of similar missile systems in the Mediterranean in 2008 A further test could follow in early 2016. This could include launching a test of the SS-17 and SS-18 Flies from a submerged runway near the Russian port of Sevastopol. The SS-18 aircraft would also carry a cruise missile with a range of up to 600 miles (880km). The SS-18, or Soviet-era submarine-launched cruise missile, would be a modern upgrade from the SS-18 and SS-21, which have been based in a ship in the Mediterranean since the early 1980s SS-18 is considered one of the fastest nuclear subs in the world. A nuclear reactor is installed beneath the surface of the weapon, allowing it to remain at sea for extended periods and is thought to be able to hit cruise missiles and ballistic missiles more than 100 times more powerful than today's warheads An operational test is planned for 2016, but a first stage test could take place the following year This could be used to test the system, then the test series would see further development, including a further increase in the weapon's range.

Russia has been ramping up its air power in the Arctic area, and this follows the country's recent tests and manoeuvres in the region.

Russia's military has also conducted a number of military air patrols to protect the country's air bases.

The Kremlin has also added to its naval presence.

The Defence Ministry has approved plans to create an elite squadron of the Navy's elite Sea Kings squadrons.

The Sea Kings is Russia's largest and most elite navy's elite, but is facing threats on multiple fronts, some of which it faces on a monthly basis.

The state-run news agency Interfax said on Wednesday some of the new plans would include: increasing a fleet-wide naval strike group that could help in the event of a crisis and respond in a crisis to naval mishaps in the event of another crisis; an increase in the number of Sea Dragons",1
"About Time! Christian Group Sues Amazon and SPLC for Designation as Hate Group All we can say on this one is it s about time someone sued the Southern Poverty Law Center!On Tuesday, D. James Kennedy Ministries (DJKM) filed a lawsuit against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the charity navigation organization GuideStar, and Amazon, for defamation, religious discrimination, and trafficking in falsehood. 

DJKM alleges that the SPLC, in association with guide-star travel site Travelodge.com, has published and distributed inaccurate news articles and blogs about its members on the internet and at radio broadcast programs to promote the false claim that people at DJKM are being persecuted by American Muslims for their membership in the Church of Islam.

The lawsuit also accuses DJKM members of ""stealing members' identities and information from the church.""

The case, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, is being led by DJKM's attorney David T. Wasserberg, who recently filed with the court a motion to dismiss the complaint.

""We want to make sure that the suit is brought only after the suit is dismissed,"" Wasserberg said in response to requests for comment. ""We want to make it clear in the filing that if the lawsuit is dismissed the parties will pursue civil rights actions against SPLC, as it has already done, so that the case can proceed.""

""The church is an integral part of DJKM, providing us with a platform to advocate for our members and to help them find a place in our society that supports them.""

DJKM's request to dismiss the lawsuit has been heard twice before, in November. In a separate motion to dismiss by Judge R. Nathan D. Hilton, the group claims no genuine controversy resulted from DJKM's articles in January, and no actual harm by DJKM has occurred.

However, Hilton ruled that some of the articles may be slanderous to DJKM members, and that DJKM members ""may reasonably infer from the articles and from comments posted on the site that they represent a public-facing organization that has a right to receive the same rights"" as other organizations.

In addition, DJKM requests that Hilton dismiss the allegations and countermand the SPLC's Motion to Dismiss. That motion was filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, as well as several other organizations that have also accused the SPLC of engaging in defamation.

Wasserberg also claims that several other DJKM members reported the ""hostile rhetoric"" of fellow members about them in public on Facebook pages of the Southern Poverty Law Center, to be ""contrary to the church's teachings and traditions.""

The lawsuit alleges that SPLC, in its ""Public Relations Policy,"" states that ""[t]he SPLC does not publish or promote any official publication",1

Some people are so obsessed with race as a problem because, as a people, we're constantly reminded of it as a way to control others. The Left blames white Europeans for the problems that arise because they have been ""white"" to a greater or lesser extent throughout history and are therefore incapable of being ""white"" again.

""A few hours ago someone on the right tried to blame the victims of the Charleston church shooting on white people for the deaths of black men and women in recent years and it hit my readers on the mind.""

"Sports Bar Owner Bans NFL Games…Will Show Only ‘True American’ Sports: ‘I’d like to speak for rural America’ [Video] The owner of the Ringling Bar, located south of White Sulphur Springs, is standing behind his Facebook post that criticizes NFL players who take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality. The post was made on the Ringling Bar s Facebook page Tuesday night and has since  been shared more than 4,000 times. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2017)

The Facebook post from the owner of the Ringling bar about the protesters, who call themselves PEDIs, the National Guard and the Confederate flag, is in support of players who take a knee during the national anthem and has more than 4,000 shares and likes.

""They don't respect my American flag, disrespect mine military,"" posted the post from the owner of a nearby business on his Facebook page. ""That's what is wrong in this country and that's what is at war. The flag is not to be defaced.""

The owner of the Ringling bar, who would only speak on background but confirmed he was the owner, said he doesn't agree with kneeling during the anthem.

He has also been targeted for criticism, with one customer sending him a text during which he called his customer a ""f------ stupid f------ son of a bitch."" This is the text in which the restaurant owner responded, with text sent with his phone.

The owner has since removed that message from his Facebook, though he will continue to receive it as evidence.

He posted on Thursday evening that he does not want any more of his criticism of protesting players or anyone else to be used as evidence of his own race, even if it's the owner of the restaurant who's calling a racist slur. He also expressed anger with the owner of the popular White Sulphur Springs area restaurant, where he ordered beef brisket for his customers. The owner of the White Sulphur Springs restaurant referred calls to Ringling for comment.

""That is sick, that's sick. Look, I am an American. I think most people in my business would not disrespect the flag, the soldiers,"" he said.

The owner of White Sulphur Springs said there was no racism in his comments to the post, to be published in its entirety. But when he received a call from a member of NBC Chicago about the comments, he confirmed some of the slurs, but said he was not trying to discriminate on any basis.

""I'm not calling those cowards cowards, I'm the owner of that restaurant, and I'm a guy who loves the food, I'm an old family man, I have a great business ... I think the things that I'm putting out there is being honest,"" said the owner.

"Latest Pipeline Leak Underscores Dangers Of Dakota Access Pipeline FILE – In this Sept. 15, 2005 file photo, the marker that welcomes commuters to Cushing, Okla. is seen. (AP Photo/The Oklahoman, Matt Strasen, File) Underscoring once again the dangers of America’s unreliable fossil fuel infrastructure, a significant U.S. oil pipeline has been shut down after a leak was reported . The leak caused a massive explosion that destroyed at least one car and caused a second, smaller blast, officials said Tuesday, Sept. 15, 2005. The rupture caused the leak for miles, causing an oil train to break a mile away in a suburb of Tulsa. (AP Photo/The Oklahoman, Steve DeClerk)

AUSTIN - A huge oil leak has shut down one oil train carrying crude from Texas to New York in Oklahoma, sending a dozen cars careening down Interstate 40 and then into a marsh near the railroad's northern terminus in Oklahoma City. The crash left at least one car at the site of the accident, and officials say only about 10 people were trapped.

Texas Department of Transportation officials said Friday the crew who tried to reopen the spillway shut down the train before they could assess the problems the pipeline was holding back from coming in.

The spillway had not been used in 30 years as work crews shut down its valves in the wake of a large 2005 tornado that left thousands of people without power and prompted an evacuation near the site, officials said.

The pipeline was shut in the event of an oil spill and would not reopen until Friday, Transportation Secretary Steve DeWine told the Tulsa World newspaper shortly after 2 p.m.

Tulsa officials said the company that owns the station for the northbound train, New York Southwestern Railroad, notified the agency on Friday that the accident involved a ""potentially catastrophic leak."" The company would not publicly comment further.

New York Southwestern Railroad spokesman John Parnello told the newspaper that while that train and another line are being monitored by a Federal Railroad Administration unit, and would be examined on a case-by-case basis, their oil lines are ""prohibited from being used for any use on the platform in the pipeline system.""

Tulsa Mayor Ed Bonner on Monday told local newspapers he was urging Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin to allow a temporary shutdown of the highway to clear debris and to provide an alternate route.<|endoftext|>A man whose throat was slashed outside St Lawrence church went off at 12.59am after attending Mass, then ran into an adjoining chapel to call in the police, according to officers.

" GOP Senator Just Smacked Down The Most Punchable Alt-Right Nazi On The Internet The most punchable Alt-Right Nazi on the internet just got a thorough beatdown from Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) on Twitter during an epic tweetstorm. Richard Spencer, the Alt-Right leader who has become a human punching bag, just got the racism smacked out of him by the Republican Senator on Thursday  afternoon.

Sasse is the first member of the Senate to get the nasty treatment of Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.).

Sasse has previously called Spencer a ""Nazi sympathizer"" on the Senate floor and told him to get ""out of my goddamn country"":

The racist National Socialist Movement (NSM) is running rampant through every part of the country. The SNA is trying to destroy the country. We oppose that and are fighting against it head on every way possible. We have been doing this for as long as they know what, the last time they did it was 1933, and they know it has consequences.


I urge you to tell the SNA not to mess with this country because it will destroy it, the country, our heritage, our freedoms. I urge you to stop with their racism and the violence it inspires. They have created a national racist movement that seeks to destroy the law and to destroy our constitutional system of government. They are not anti-establishment or conservative, they are just racists.

Sasse has been pretty much doing the Donald J. Trump things: tweeting as hard as he can, holding up a sign reading ""Haters gonna hate,"" and even using the hashtag #SpencerTheJew — all of which caused quite a bit of pushback from the Republican senator at this late date. You can see his entire Twitter account here, including all the ridiculous nonsense he's tweeted since the election. It's not really fair to the entire alt-right, or anyone else on the Internet for that matter, for Sasse to get slammed by their favorite racist and xenophobic presidential candidate.<|endoftext|>The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995

The strike, in central Yemen, the Yemeni Interior Ministry said late Sunday as the White House warned the international community of a new wave of attacks.

US officials initially blamed a suspected improvised explosive device targeting an area known as al-Dhahab, which is under the control of the Iran-backed Houthis.

The American operation is considered successful although the strike destroyed a ""significant quantity"" of ammunition.

'A very clear picture on how the Houthis operated'

One of the four American killed in the strike was Petty Officer First Class Ashley Harkins, the military said.

The US military has reported attacks against its personnel in Yemen every week this year in its first six weeks in operation in the Middle East, Reuters reported earlier Saturday.

""This strike in central Yemen was conducted on March 13 to May 28 targeting a group of individuals believed to be members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP),"" said Col. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, referring to the terrorist group.

He said the strike killed at least seven AQAP militants and destroyed another 10 ""largely vehicles and communications equipment with the intent to destroy the infrastructure of al-Qaida and/or to harm Americans.""

The group is a Saudi-allied terrorist group that seeks to overthrow Yemen's longtime government that was created by ousted leader Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2002.

""The air raid resulted in no injuries except one civilian death and injured a number of more, including members of the crew of one of the damaged aircraft,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.

In recent days, an unknown number of US-led coalition air strikes have targeted a number of AQAP targets.

The attacks mostly target high-value targets within the organization's control, which it has sought to maintain as the group continues its fight of a ""caliphate,"" in opposition to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

US officials have also acknowledged that their air operations have made ""significant progress"" but insist the US and its countries remain firmly committed to fighting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.",1

It did so after Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill allowing people to obtain concealed carry licenses. The bill, SB 5, goes into effect after 30 days if passed by the Legislature.

House Bill 5 also allows people with concealed handgun licenses to carry openly in public or in bars and restaurants, which is also the intent and purpose of the new law.

Supporters of HB 5 say their proposal increases funding at the state level while reducing funding at the Texas Department of Public Safety and UTSA because the agency can't spend more funds unless it determines that more funds are needed to provide public safety services.

HB 5 also reduces funding for programs supporting people with domestic violence and substance abuse, according to the Texas Tribune.

The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.

HB 5 also requires the Texas Office of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to establish a ""gun violence resource center,"" which will work to collect incident reports and conduct background checks for people who buy rifles, handguns and shotguns.

""That's it,"" said Rep. Chris Taylor, R-Oceanside, who sponsored HB 5 and said his bill was not in response to Wednesday's fatal police shooting of Philando Castile. ""There's still more work to be done in Texas. But from my perspective, this will help us to make some progress, and the gun violence resource center will make some progress on that front.""

HB 5 passed the House by a vote of 50-39, with seven Democrats supporting the measure and all voting against the bill. Republican leadership did not offer support or opposition to legislation to repeal the state's ""Stand Your Ground"" law, another key measure that will protect someone who may be in self-defense when their life is",1

In my opinion, there are five best ideas for your open-source work—and those are as follows: You should use a different language for every part of your code.

You should use a different version of something for every part of your code. You should use a different compiler architecture than the one that you use today.

You should use a different language for every part of your code. You should use a different type-system (as in, different C or Java versions, different garbage collection, different stack allocator) than the one that you use today.

You should use a different memory model.

You should use a different way of packaging your code.

You should use a different way of testing your code because you want to have as little change in the code as possible before releasing it to the world.

The following are my own ideas on best practices that I believe everyone can apply in writing and maintaining an open-source project. However, I have not tried everyone's ideas themselves and have not personally tested them; therefore, all my points in this post are based on personal experiences but do not reflect reality. As always, if we learn something from others' experience, it's better to adopt that knowledge and use it.

He replied: “Depends on who counts the votes. I 'm worried about #CrookedHillary’s crime family: End of days for the U.S.A. The rest of the emails I got were from people wondering what to do with David’s money. The email exchange was among hundreds of millions of emails that show the inner workings of Dave’s investing fund. It's unclear if that was the only email from a man who's been a long time friend and investor in Dave’s fund. ""I've got a message for you all on Monday evening,'' he wrote to someone called Jason, who is a colleague of Dave's at CF Global Capital Fund. The email came on the heels of Dave’s news conference in New York of Hillary in Iowa, which he said was the latest event to stir up controversy in his portfolio. In it, Clinton was accused of breaking federal law by using a private email address while she was secretary of state. ""How are you managing that and where do you see that money moving, if at all?'' Dave's email continued, before informing him the person had sent him ""quite a bit of stuff lately. . . . We need to see where this is headed in terms of political donations and then we need to assess whether that's in the public interest, how it all fits into our plan with respect to the stock market.''

You can read Dave's letter about how CF Global got into the Bitcoin universe right here. And you can find out how CF Global was able to profit off of the illicit bitcoin market by trading at roughly $2 a share, much like an established Bitcoin investment bank would, while simultaneously taking out interest from banks, which is a big red flag in its own right. CF Global's other investments also didn't work out as well. In fact, CF Global failed in 2010 after it announced it wasn't even going to fund bitcoin because there weren't enough investors to cover its expected losses. One of those investors was Dave’s current partner, Steve. When Dave was told of CF Global's failure, he sent a message saying he wanted to invest in Dave’s fund, but CF Global, with its own losses, was not an investment manager he wanted to be dealing with at all. ""We made one significant mistake: we didn't have enough money to fund Dave's plan,'' he wrote to Steve. He added: †I asked why don‡t you just sell the Bitcoin and then go buy shares in the stock market? I am not talking about shares",1
" Sean Spicer Baffles Reporters, Claims Trump Isn’t Responsible For Hiring Flynn (VIDEO) On Tuesday, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer once again baffled reporters and other thinking individuals by once again saying the dumbest thing imaginable.Asked why the White House refuses to provide documents related to former National Security Advisor and registered foreign agent Michael Flynn s hiring, Spicer took the tried-and-true  position of ""that's classified"", a comment that is as clear an indicator of why even those not privy to the details of any classified information should be able to tell you why Flynn's hire was so bafflingly stupid:

In spite of everything that we've been going through, and I've been going through it a week and a half or so, nobody's talking about the fact that you have an absolute criminal conspiracy at the highest level of our government in effect to cover up what happened on the 26th.""

This is ridiculous.

To be perfectly clear, the White House hasn't yet issued a formal statement about the Flynn situation, but as we've established from the documents already presented, the Obama administration was actively trying to cover up the unmasking of Trump Team associates by using the Justice Department as a tool to smear them and frame them with a false narrative. That's what the media is supposed to be doing with information, not making it up, and the White House doesn't agree with that.

If Flynn and Spicer were serious about protecting America and maintaining the integrity of the election, they'd stop lying. But that's what White House officials do when they take a position they clearly don't have credibility or support, so they keep talking.<|endoftext|>The most important thing an adult can do every day is make sure they eat enough healthy snacks. However, many parents may not know what an apple is, or how to get enough nutrition from apples.

According to new research, adults should start with 3.4 ounces of healthy snacks per day. While that amount varies depending on how much of the good stuff they are feeding their little one (1-4 ounces recommended), it doesn't have to be that much to eat every day. This is because the nutrients in a handful of healthy snack foods have been linked to an even more effective brain function.

"UNHOLY ALLIANCE: Hillary Clinton’s Saudi Sponsors Support Terrorism, Islamist Extremism 21st Century Wire says Amid the tossing and turning of media hit pieces and partisan mud slinging in advance of the US presidential vote in November, very little focus is given on the actual record and policies of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.With this week s damning revelations regarding  what exactly went down in Benghazi last year, the US media has been silent. Hillary Clinton has been forced to acknowledge her record-breaking failure to protect Americans at US-designated terror target US Consulate in Benghazi, while she was Secretary of State. The failure was an egregious violation of her sworn duty to protect US national security. Hillary Clinton was the first Secretary of State to resign from office after being charged with multiple felonies including perjury and lying under oath. This revelation is far worse than just a criminal prosecution, but it still leaves Americans without a clear understanding of her actions and career as Secretary of State.To the average US citizen, the events at US-designated terrorist target consulate Benghazi were seen as little more than a mere ""scandal"" by a small cadre of radical Islam fanatics. But to the very media that have been so eager to attack Hillary Clinton as a radical Republican, the failure of Hillary Clinton's Department of State is far more significant (and alarming) - not only in the way it affected her chances of becoming President of the United States, but in the way that it led to a global backlash against Washington and international law in general.Since Hillary Clinton was installed as Secretary of State, we have experienced unprecedented levels of aggression, economic devastation, and a massive expansion of America's military power and influence in the Middle East. This is not unique to Benghazi. Hillary Clinton's role in implementing the Obama administration's strategy of containment in the Persian Gulf in response to terrorism has also led to the spread of the virus that threatens the entire region. She has promoted the policy of regime change through direct intervention and military force. In addition, when Hillary Clinton supported the ""Kill List"" that led to the execution of Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden, she was caught on videotape being heard ordering this brutal killing campaign against people around the world who had no connection to Al Qaeda.We see no accountability for this or any other crime Hillary Clinton has engaged in, no criminal or civil proceedings for her actions, at least no criminal charges against her. And we are left to wonder the outcome of those presidential primaries and other polls which are used to determine which candidate will represent one of the many factions in the US electoral process.

" Even Trump’s Best Friend Joe Scarborough Can’t Handle His ‘Disqualifying’ KKK Support (VIDEO) Recently, Joe Scarborough has found himself the subject of, shall we say, criticism because of his insanely pro-Trump bias something that bothers pretty much everyone at MSNBC. In fact, their relationship has traditionally been so strong that Scarborough bragged about giving The Donald debate tips. Recently Scarborough was busted revealing  that Trump told the then NBC reporter that the candidate could take out people with the stroke of a pen.

Here was the interview:

So, I think Joe, you were on MSNBC a long time. How did your relationship develop?

There was a long-standing relationship. I have a great job there but one issue that had come up recently was Joe's stance. He had taken out some people on Twitter that I've talked to over the years. So there was a problem here because they were on the same air.

The problem was they were going to the same place on the same day. So then I took out Joe, and this was before Trump had even made himself available for one debate, and it was just a matter of Joe saying, ""I don't like that Donald Trump uses his words to manipulate."" And I knew he was right. There were people all over the Internet who were using their words to manipulate each other; that was his strategy to undermine their message. I said why do you have all this information? And he said, because when you can't communicate, you lie.

To be fair, he didn't really call me out personally. I know he called me out, but there was just kind of kind of this sense in the room that he had to keep his own counsel. Which I didn't. He was on the air, on Monday. It was two hours of discussion about why it was okay, how to fix the press, how to fix the country, what the country needs, what's wrong with our country. And his words about Hillary Clinton were outrageous. He would say something outrageous, and everybody would go, ""How do you know that?"" And I looked up at him and I said, you don't know. And then he gave me a script for that segment. He said, ""Now, look, if your answer is that Hillary Clinton needs a third-party campaign, then you need to go for it. I don't want anybody else running that.""

Then I just said, okay, but I'm not willing to do that for my own good. I wanted Joe to stay on the air. And then I looked over to Bob. They were still on the air, it was just another segment. I said, well, you know, I'm out, so let's just work it out. Because I've got great jobs.

"BOOM! Danish Government Considers Seizing Migrant’s Valuables To Pay For Benefits Is the European gravy train finally coming to an end?The Danish parliament is considering a bill to seize migrants valuables to pay for their benefits.The leftists are very upset about this commonsense legislation. Daily Sabah reported:A controversial Danish bill to seize migrants valuables to pay for their stay in asylum  centers has just landed in parliament.The bill, which has already been submitted to the committee on public administration, could be discussed in April or May. If the parliament approves the plan, all Danish citizens living abroad would see their monthly stipends reduced by 20 percent to 1,500 kroner.But many are worried about the impact to their daily lives, given that the plan won't apply to non-European asylum seekers.Under the new regime, migrants, who can only be deported to Finland if they commit or aid crimes, would receive a one-time reduction in welfare benefits of 75 percent.However, the bill contains clauses that will prevent any action against perpetrators of crimes.The government is confident of successfully convincing the right-wing parliamentarians that the law has a legitimate place in their society.This is why some MPs have called for blocking parliament.One says: ""Let's see if they still have the courage to vote for this.""However, the Swedish government said it has no objection to the bill if it makes its way to Denmark's parliament.It said the parliament, which voted on Monday for the bill, is responsible for passing important laws that affect Swedes abroad as well as Swedes in their local territory.The Swedish Minister for Employment, Integration and Economic Inclusion Carl Bildt said: ""It's a good day when Denmark becomes a 'refugee state.'

"Do You Belong To An Extraterrestrial Lineage? According to Sitchin’s interpretation of Mesopotamian iconography and symbolism, outlined in his 1976 book The 12th Planet and its sequels, there is an undiscovered planet beyond Neptune that follows a long, elliptical orbit, reaching the inner solar system roughly every 3,600 years. This planet is called Nibiru (although Jupiter was  never named it, instead describing it as ""a satellite""). Sitchin estimates that Nibiru is 5 billion km (3.25 billion mi) from Earth, but that its orbit is so close that a direct collision would be devastating to our planet.

Circling the Sun?

Astronomers estimate that more than 400 billion ""quasars"" — the tiny, fast-flowing star-like stars that are found right around the center of the Milky Way — are active in the Milky Way system. When fully active, these stars can produce about 80,000 times the total sun's energy each hour.

So with this kind of activity around him, ""He also would have been exposed to an enormous number of quasars,"" says Sitchin.

Nibiru would have provided the perfect venue for such a direct collision, since the sun is one of the stars closest to its parent star.

But if it happened during his life, one wonders why it didn't happen sooner, but why then only 1.4 years ago — two weeks after the collision — did it take place?

To better understand this intriguing question, cosmologists must first understand the nature of neutron stars to understand what happened to them. At the beginning of each nuclear era, a star burns up and disintegrates, taking its material along for the ride. At this moment, the neutron star is just 1% of its initial mass — it is a neutron star with one neutrino, a particle that is more energetic than the sun (a ""b"" than an ""n"" is emitted on a hydrogen atom). But as its neutron star decays, it loses more of its neutron-trapped neutron material.

When that material decays, the material in question is a different kind — a neutron star. And the material that becomes an neutron star is much older than the material that made the original neutron-star. When this material decays — and this material is a bit older — it breaks apart — taking with it all of the material in its surroundings, like snowflakes on a frozen lake.

As the older neutrinos fall to Earth with the material, the resulting radio waves are absorbed inside a sphere called the magnetar, about 100 km in diameter. This magnetar is surrounded by a sphere of solid material, or iron meteorites, which is a thick disk of molten iron. As the magnetar cools, the material inside drops out. The material",1
"THE ROBBING OF INNOCENCE: 12 Yr Old Students Given CDC Survey About Transgender, Gay And Oral Sex The left believes these are all perfectly acceptable topics to discuss with our young children. Whatever you do, just don t mention God!A public hearing is taking place Wednesday morning in the Massachusetts State House to look into a controversial sex survey given to middle school and high school students.Developed  by researchers at the University of Virginia with funding from a national grant, the online survey asked students about their thoughts on sexual matters, and how they felt about their sexual life. The survey's sample size appears to be significantly smaller than reported.According to the study's creators, the survey was developed with the goal of identifying how much children feel about their sex lives. The researchers also looked at how young people are talking about sex.According to the Massachusetts State House Rules Commission, students who participate in online conversations are required to remain anonymous and can use their names only.""That could be really frustrating,"" said one state Assemblywoman who is part of the debate. ""I think my job is not to protect the children,"" added State Representative Nancy Moore. ""It's my responsibility to protect the rights of students who are having conversations that could be potentially damaging to their academic futures. We need more transparency.""Several lawmakers criticized the Massachusetts State House, claiming that it's a place that can't even accept open dialogue about sexual matters.One Democrat said the survey is the reason the House could find it very difficult to work on other important legislation.The controversy began when the survey was first released by the University of Virginia in August -- three months after the study was created. While the survey was intended to be used with young people, the researchers did not know the student demographics beforehand, according to the report. However, after its release, the school's parent association told ABC15-FOX 31 that the survey was used to determine the sex of the childrens' sex partners.""I'm pretty shocked,"" said State Senator Susan J. Lerer, who sponsored the bill that would require colleges and universities to provide sex education classes to students enrolled in their programs.""This is not a college, this is a high school,"" she said. ""Is this a safe place for a children?""Many lawmakers argued that students are too young to know that their sex partners can be their peers.""Kids ought to know that you are not supposed to have sex with two different partners at the same time,"" said State Representative Mary Beth Walsh, who proposed the bill.That same month, a Massachusetts congressman sent a letter to the American College of Pediatricians, stating that the group has ""discourse restrictions"" and told the American College of Pediatricians to investigate whether the survey was used properly.As the controversy heats up, some legislators, like State Representative Christine LeDuc, say the findings would make them reconsider educating their student's sexuality.""I don't take sides, I really don't",1
"JOE BIDEN’S SHOCKING ANNOUNCEMENT: “What the hell, man?” [Video] VP Joe Biden: Yeah, I m going to run in 2020. Reporter: For what? Biden: For president! What the hell, man? https://t.co/fsRl25AD12 pic.twitter.com/GMco1PkJiL CNN (@CNN) December 6, 2016 

Here they are at the Democratic debate earlier today, after a debate that included the entire Republican field in an all-male line up:

That is a remarkable lineup. What we need is an alternative, a third political party with gender diversity, like Bernie Sanders. It's what was said at the beginning of this conversation. https://t.co/KG4Y9KpjY9 CNN (@CNN) Donald Trump: We're going to run the country like hell until the GOP is in the ditch. Bernie Sanders: We're going to win. Trump: I think you're going to win, Bernie, and I'm going to make sure we do it.

When we reached out to The Real CNN for comment about the disparity in terms of their policies that could bring about a female president in the United States, we were told they thought this would be a good idea, but weren't sure where it would come from. ""We didn't have a solid answer on any policy,"" said Alyssa Milne , a CNN spokeswoman. ""It's really hard to say where to make recommendations when there are dozens of candidates for the VP nomination right now.""

But what about gender-neutral policy on other issues?

As The Huffington Post reports:

For example, they're not as likely to agree on abortion as Donald Trump, but are generally open to legislation that doesn't just criminalize, but actually helps the woman to have access to an abortion. ""I think that has value,"" said Sarah Binder with the National Right to Life Council, which is part of the Coalition for Humane Studies, who also wrote about this discussion on Twitter. When it comes to other major issues, though, they disagree. According to ""A Primer on the Presidential Podium,"" a report published by the anti-abortion group National Center for Women and Politics, the major issue on which they agree on most often is abortion, but ""most are not willing… to call it the ultimate ban.""

Brennan says the reason for this is because the GOP, even as President Obama gets more and more vocal on abortion and its importance, doesn't recognize a real need. ""The only reason these people are on the ticket is because they want to vote for a woman,"" she says. For them, the ""ultimate ban"" of abortion is that it is a right and the only way to get there is to do something to get more access to that choice for women like themselves who don't",1

QUESTIONS FROM SENTINELS/RESIDENTS


If there are only three people in the class/loud area please leave one person for each person in the silent spot (please note that there are additional restrictions regarding each person) to allow everyone, please note the following:


1. Each person must stop in front of someone else without speaking, otherwise you get the extra ""no, this person doesn't speak"" penalty.


2. The person in the silent spot is required to use the correct language to the class/loud area (except, if a partner stops in the silent spot and gives no answer, he becomes the person on who is on the left).


3. The person on the right cannot speak without looking at someone who is looking at him/her in the left side of the class/loud area.


4. The person in the silence spot cannot yell during the class/loud area and he/she must not yell or shout during the course of this course.

(I suggest leaving an extra 20 minutes between the time your person decides to interrupt the instructor and the time of the end of the course)

So, why Mexico would do what Peña Nieto did:

Mexico wants to build a wall, along the 2,000 mile border between its two countries, to keep illegal narcotics out. President Trump said on Monday that he wants a ""physical wall for Mexico""",1
" Emboldened NRA Threatens New York Times: ‘We’re Coming For You’ (VIDEO) The NRA has a new favorite toy, but there are no bullets involved except maybe the bullet points they include in their scripts. Dana Loesch has transformed herself from useful Fox News idiot to darling of the Second Amendment, and the NRA is more than happy to put her stern  message into our heads and our minds.

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

Here's where the NRA is at today:

They're sending out this memo to their members that you need to make sure your gun is safe while shooting and there's no way around it. ""Do not bring it into a store in case if the security guard comes into your store and you bring it through or if you do not take the security badge, he will see it and say, 'I would never leave a weapon in the shop,'"" Loesch said on Tuesday's edition of her show Fox & Friends.

Advertisement

Loesch then proceeded to give her advice on the subject, suggesting, no, that you could do nothing other than tell the security guard you have a gun and leave it at a store. But I know for a fact that the ""unsafe zones"" don't even exist. But you can always bring your gun in. No word if that will keep the security guard from seeing it.

Advertisement

Loesch even gave her advice: she could try to take a gun from one of the people in the lobby of the store and ""put it in a box in front of the counter."" She then tried telling him about the safe. He said, ""What can I do with that gun?""

Loesch made an excellent point: a gun's really not a thing, it's only a symbol. So if anyone's concerned that the TSA might confiscate your gun for some reason, ask yourself: is that safe-keeper your friend or a criminal?

If I'm not mistaken, that is the same gun the terrorists recently used to attack the people at a Christmas market in Oregon; and yes, the one the FBI just found after several days at the top of the TSA's ""most wanted"" list.

Loesch also had her own take on the NRA's recent campaign to blame people who carry guns for gun violence. She pointed us to an article and explained it fairly clearly in case you needed it:

[…] The National Rifle Association has made a lot of noise about the ""gun-free zones"" where it has created ""trigger lock"" legislation that would require gun permit holders either to show ID at their front door or to ""re-register"" their weapons. The NRA's gun-free zones, which typically include places like parks, malls, hospitals and schools, have proven problematic, with mass shootings",1
" Noam Chomsky GOES OFF On Donald Trump: ‘He’s A CLOWN!’ (VIDEO) It s no secret that world-renowned political theorist Noam Chomsky does NOT want Donald Trump in the White House, and thinks it s an absolute tragedy that the presumptive Republican nominee has even managed to get as far as he has.In an interview with Art Is Power, the author and  linguist has made waves as he expressed his dismay over Trump's decision to nominate former Goldman Sachs employee Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, arguing that, in his words, ""Tillerson doesn't have the qualifications necessary to be the secretary of state"". Chomsky also criticized Trump for claiming he had no knowledge of climate change before declaring he was ""so concerned"" that he has actually studied the topic himself.So how does Chomsky think that Tillerson's background as a corporate lawyer was somehow more qualified? That he had ""a real problem""? That his positions ""go beyond the scope of being an investment banker""? Chomsky claims that such a position ""can't possibly be a good one, given that you can't do everything"".And how does Chomsky believe Tillerson's positions that he would ""discipline his workers and ensure that it wouldn't happen again? How can it be any good?""To hear Chomsky tell it, Trump's ""unpredictability"" and the ""unpredictability is not only stupid, but it has been proven to make us less safe. As of November 8, just before midnight, the US had more than 4,000 people killed by guns because the US had not tightened its gun laws enough.""As for the other issues that make him ""scared to death that Trump might have them in office"", Chomsky is quick to add, ""There are two issues: 1) How is he going to take us forward?""And then Chomsky stops. That's because he s worried. And scared.Of course, it is not clear at this point what, if anything, actually concerns Chomsky. While Trump has yet to give concrete answers on how he plans to deal with Russia, there have already been a series of tweets from the candidate that seem to contradict his own foreign policy. Chomsky appears genuinely concerned about any new sanctions or legislation that he might be forced to enact. Indeed, his concerns appear rooted in his belief that the US is running out of time until Trump leaves office.""You have to be careful in your thinking about our current condition,"" he wrote in an op-ed published in the London Observer. ""How are you going to fix all this, how do you stop us with our crazy tendencies. I am the son of immigrants who came from a war-torn country, where we lost so many and who had only one idea how to be part of their society: that has disappeared. Now we have our own problem. The same is true of the world around us.""Despite Chomsky s concerns, however, there has reportedly been",1
"5 Ways The Media Responded With Butthurt To Donald Trump’s Victory The media doesn’t even try to hide its shameless pro-Socialist bias these days. Since nobody really pays attention to them anymore, you might have missed some of the more entertaining butthurt spouted by shameless propagandists posing as journalists. 2016 election night coverage on the propaganda news channels is a lesson  in the importance of following the agenda, even if it means exposing a few of your fellow politicians' crimes.


For a new generation of leftists who want to become serious about change in this country, let's be honest. It's not so much our job to educate and inform those who hold power. You cannot make progress on this issue by trying to educate them about the true causes of our problems, or getting your facts on record. You really can't. Your job is to tell folks what to say.


So, if there is a candidate you like, write them a letter or email them a letter. Let them know that if you like what they are doing, you might as well support it. Make sure to tell them your opinion. Don't be afraid to tell them why. If they don't like what you are saying on this issue, simply tell them that there will be plenty of opportunities for them to say what they want, if they like, with all their supporters over the rest of the world.

You can thank my mom for that, huh?

I know some of you have your own agenda, and you're going to be very selective about what you tell all that anti-Trump nonsense to, but it doesn't really matter. Just don't tell them what to say, or how they should think. Remember what you said to me? 'Tell them what they want to say. Don't be afraid to tell.' What an effective lesson. Just stop telling those with other ideas what to say.


There is no need to tell them why, if you're really not going to. Your job is just to listen, to see how people react, and help them understand the bigger picture. Then you might be surprised to figure out what might be important.

This is a short biography written by me. This was the final biography that was written for my new guild as we were already on level 70.

This biography describes The Black Citadel at the beginning of the Dark Portal on Azeroth. This was never intended for public view as it will likely never be released, and while it was a great event at the time it has since moved to a different location.

For my own sake this will probably never be published because The Black Citadel is one of my favorite places from the time and has very significant lore within lore that I do not remember personally. This information is not my own and the information and facts contained in this description are merely to help those that may choose to look up the lore behind their favorites places.

I would be very grateful for any feedback you may have towards the description. It was very well written and the events discussed were just as significant, if not more so. Thank you for your patience!

I will be adding additional information as time goes on, for now, you can look at the first draft of the section that is just above.

The Last Battle

At the conclusion of its greatest campaign, the Dark Portal was closed for the day, but The Black Citadel remained. Even if the gate remained closed for the day, there was a last hope of escape: from the Black Citadel itself.

There was no doubt that The Black Citadel was a dangerous place; the Black Citadel, as it were, stood between us and the end of the Dark Portal.

The very center of The Black Citadel was known as the Black Citadel Gate. No living being dared enter in or out of it. The gates did not open even if a dragon",1
"AT&T, Time Warner and the Death of Privacy AT&T, Time Warner and the Death of Privacy By Amy Goodman and Denis Moynihan AT&T plans to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion. ( Mark Lennihan / AP ) It has been 140 years since Alexander Graham Bell uttered the first words through his experimental telephone, to his lab assistant: 

""Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., and to whom is committed the obligations of the third degree...""

As the first modern telephone — Bell's first and only product — the Bell Telephone Laboratories-Time Warner purchase is a coup for the nation's telecommunications company, even after a rocky launch in the 1950s. Time said the merger would provide it with more flexibility to sell spectrum, which is the key to the nation's wireless networks, as a separate company, and it would give it even more revenue stream when the wireless market is expected to double by 2048, according to one estimate.

Article Continued Below

After months of lobbying, Time Warner was persuaded to commit to the purchase, its first for-profit merger. After four years of research and development (R&D), AT&T said Wednesday that it would buy the media and communications company for $85.4 billion as part of a merger that also has already raised the ire of critics, some of whom see a cozy deal between the two corporations and the Trump administration when it comes to the surveillance of phone calls. But Time Warner president Barack Obama insisted this was not a deal that would create one new company, but would allow Time Warner to remain independent. ""It's not our intention to make sure we don't look like they had any influence on our decision-making, that's not our intent,"" Obama said at a news conference here. ""It's true that we believe that our future is shaped by the success of the competition we've been fighting. As consumers and employees, we need to be comfortable when companies invest money. That investment, if made, and if it is used to develop and build a better and better product, can be an investment that is well done by us and the rest of the world. And that's why companies of every size, any sector, all over the world invest in research and development."" That investment, in the form of patents and other business innovations, will continue even after the deal is done. AT&T and Time Warner will have the same president, Robert Iger, who served as CEO of General Motors Co. when it agreed to sell that company to Ford Motor Co.

AT&T has long faced strong and growing criticism after paying the federal government nearly $300 million in civil penalties — some of it to settle lawsuits on deceptive practices by Time Warner — in 2008 amid allegations that its wireless network was misused by Verizon Wireless Corp. and Comcast Corp. in the name of selling advertising space.

"Internationally-backed Libyan forces attack Daesh positions in Sirte Fighters loyal to Libya’s UN-backed government guard a look-out point in the city of Sirte, east of Tripoli, as they try to clear the last remaining Daesh terrorists from the al-Jiza al-Bahriya neighborhood, October 26, 2016. (Photo by AFP) Libyan forces have launched a fresh offensive against Daesh positions in  Sirte after recapturing the city from IS fighters in late October, the Pentagon said on Thursday.

""Libyan forces have successfully launched a new offensive against terrorist positions in Sirte, a city which had fallen into government hands in December, December 10,"" Col. David Sneddon, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters in Baghdad.

""Libyan forces have begun redeploying in the city. Once they've successfully repelled terrorist threat, Libyan forces can move further and further toward the city,"" he said. ""Once the threat is over, they can begin the campaign to retake Sirte.""

In addition to the capital, Tripoli, Sirte, a former naval base and strategic point in Libya's North African country, was liberated from IS militants earlier this month.

Libya was split into eastern and western halves of Sirte before it fell into the hands of ISIS in 2014 in a brutal six-month campaign.

Iraqi forces have been able to recapture more than 80% of the country's territory from ISIL.

Iraqi and allied forces, backed by air power from the US-led coalition, have managed to retake hundreds of square kilometers (m²) out of the country's 664km (350-mile) border with Syria in northern and west of the country.

In January, US-led forces in northern Syria recaptured Raqqa from ISIL. ISIS in eastern Syria, meanwhile, have been pushed out of Deir al-Zour province and Raqqa city and its suburbs. ISIL still operate in western Mosul, Baghdad and Ramadi.

Iraqi security forces and allied forces backed by US-led coalition aircraft have been pushing back ISIL after its control over significant swaths of territory in Mosul, the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, and the city of Ramadi in northwest Iraq.

"OBAMACARE: Wheels Slowly Falling Off The Socialized Healthcare Train…Billions Wasted Wasn t the point of Obamacare to provide health insurance for everyone? After BILLIONS spent on a website that was unworkable and BILLIONS spent to set up exchanges across America, it looks like the ones who need Obamacare the most can t afford it .the irony is certainly not lost  on the Obamacare crowd. They can argue that its lack of a viable federal solution to a problem that can be solved fairly and efficiently by the states on its own is just an aberration of a dysfunctional political system. This argument can be made because it's based on the assumption that Congress must take over every facet of American politics as if they were its own company, and that it's okay to try to take something off the table because Congress is dysfunctional.The second point that gets brought up is that the Affordable Care Act is just a partial solution to the problem of having no comprehensive system to provide health insurance in the country as a whole, in the sense that it only offers insurance in some states , states that have been hit with tremendous economic hardship over the last few decades, as opposed to people who want to keep buying insurance in their state of residence, who are less affected by the economic pressures. This idea that Obamacare is just the best solution to a problem that isn't actually solved by anything but individual states doing the best thing for the overall health of their citizens, ignores the fact that the same problems persist across the board as an individual and household level of the country.For example, just look at the numbers that show that while the number of uninsured Americans has fallen by over 50% nationally , the number of people losing health insurance, while not dropping nationwide as a whole, has done so for many individual states. The number of people that are uninsured or underinsured nationally, are nearly 50% less concentrated across individual States than states that have been hit by a financial downturn due to federal stimulus efforts, when the amount of people that are uninsured or underinsured have been falling more overall .The bottom line is that, from my observations, I am absolutely convinced that the Affordable Care Act is the last best hope to a better solution for those individual Americans who want to keep buying insurance in their own state of residence. It actually gets me more and more anxious about the entire political situation.It's as if they believe that in all of modern history there has never been an economy with such a high degree of economic hardship throughout a population, and with such an extreme level of government intervention and waste, while they don't hear about it while at the same time have never seen a study saying that the government can provide an economically beneficial system that is sustainable for the long term because it's entirely based on the premise that it is totally independent of government interference and waste. It's as if they assume that the problem with every government intervention and waste over the last hundred years",1
"Ron Paul: ‘I Can’t Support Trump if He’s GOP Pick’ and ‘Neocons Will Love Hillary’ David Sherfinski Washington TimesFormer Texas Rep. Ron Paul said Friday he couldn t support GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump if Mr. Trump wins the party s nomination, saying Mr. Trump s views on the scope of executive authority could surpass those of President Obama. No, I couldn t do that,  because it is no more an abuse of power by me to support Hillary Clinton than it was to support President Bush in the Iraq War. He's far more knowledgeable, far more liberal and so on and so on, and that's the difference. The point is, I have no opinion on who's gonna be president. I just don't like that the two greatest choices are Donald Trump a) And then you support him b) or c) and then you are supporting a nominee like Donald Trump. Why don't you have one person running that matters? How about Bernie Sanders? And don't even ask me what that would take. Because I don't know the right question. I love Bernie Sanders a) because he has said what's reasonable in the context of foreign policy and b) because he seems to me to be a person who genuinely cares about this country, and c) he seems to me to be someone not who says what seems to me like things that have to be said, but he seems to me to be someone who will do the right thing for a party or for the country. He didn't say what I said but I like what he said. I don't know how that works, but it probably does. So I just don't love Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE) It sounds fair-minded that we should reject people who have shown no compassion for American and Israeli citizens. Senator Sanders, how do you disagree with that? (APPLAUSE) Thank you. Senator Bernie Sanders. I have never met or know of anybody that seems to like a war. I want to be strong in defending Israel. I oppose all of the disastrous ideas of the Bush administration, and I oppose every disastrous idea of the Clinton administration. And in fact, I believe there's one war that is still being fought today, in Iraq. Let me be very clear, and I'm really getting a little bit of pushback from some of my conservative friends. The fact is we have seen, in the last 15 years, not one successful attack against our troops, not one successful raid on Osama bin Laden's hideout. Most attacks have occurred in places like Somalia, Yemen or Libya, where we have had much greater success. There has been one war, unfortunately, that has not been well attended. In fact, I have seen some, though, who feel very strongly that it's not my great responsibility to be the party of Reaganism, and that's that war in Vietnam. Is that not a war? I'm sorry,",1
"“PROGRESSIVE” DE BLASIO VISITS IOWA: Denies He’s Running For President…So He Just Wanted To Visit Iowa? Soooo, NYC Mayor de Blasio wants you to believe he just wants to visit Iowa. He s been running for President since before he became Mayor, that s why he ran for Mayor. And even in progressive NYC, everyone still despises him for doing nothing. And yes, he s further  progressive than Hillary, but he s still a liberal, not just with regard to what he s supposed to be, because they are all liberals, including him.

So, here it is, why Bernie will do the right thing here.

I'm sure you're now shaking your head in agreement, because this really, really does look like a great idea. Bernie has some serious issues with ""left-wing"" and ""liberal""-type political parties, and I don't blame him. As a progressive I'm in favor of political freedom, and political parties are, as you know, the primary opposition to political freedom at the moment: there are so many corrupt, liberal-type politicians in congress who s a part of them that s pretty much an ""implementing"" of all their policies. Bernie has promised to fight for an end to corruption. And I think he will. And because he s a liberal, he will also fight for the free speech rights of our opposition? Wow. I sure hope so.

But, yes, on the whole, this plan does seem to be a pretty good idea. If we are to accept the fact that all candidates on either side of the aisle can be corrupted and thus corrupt their entire lives with money and political connections, then the political right-of-center party can't have a free run in 2016 without having at the same time a powerful opposition. You can see this coming, because Bernie has already made great strides in fighting in favor of political freedom in the last two election cycles. The reason is simple, and it is quite revealing: most liberal parties can only run one political position — a ""socialist"" one — under their banner. This is because a socialist is more powerful in the party's platform than an ""establishment"" liberal, and by ""establishment"" I mean ""white male liberal."" In other words, they only run one bigoted position that can bring them together from within the larger ""left-wing"" party, rather than running numerous alternative positions. Bernie has also promised to promote more of an ""ideological left"" within his party, because this means he will go after the ""right"" and not just the ""fringe."" This will probably help him in a potential general-election election, but it could also make him extremely vulnerable in 2016.

We have two big problems on my side, and that is: (1) our system works against the interests of the very wealthy, and (2) Hillary is far more powerful than",1
" Elijah Cummings Made Sure The GOP Is Well Aware They’re Hypocritical A**holes Regarding Flint There seems to be a definite double standard when it comes to how Republicans in Congress want to go about investigating terrible governors. When it came to investigating former Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber (D), Republicans like Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) were fast and furious with their requests to obtain the  state's voting data — and were then sued for violating the Constitution. So it would be reasonable for Republicans to be excited if they thought their fellow lawmakers' investigations would be done without violating the First Amendment.

But as we see increasingly in the wake of the recent investigations into Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker and Texas's Attorney General. It's quite remarkable to watch Republicans on the Hill — particularly on Capitol Hill — get caught in a web of red flags and obstruct on every single matter.

They want Congress to have the right to read into legislation, even though it's in all probability unconstitutional. They want some sort of right to record conversations with citizens but refuse to turn over the tapes to the media, despite the fact that that's generally one of the greatest guarantees of our democracy. And they want Congress to have the right to make the government listen to them but reject any and all requests to do so.

So when the New York Times and others asked Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) why federal investigations must be closed ""when a Republican is president,"" Amash's response was… well… funny. He said of his Democratic colleagues: ""We're gonna have to put some restrictions on that part of it.""

But that's what Republican lawmakers say when they're not actually talking about how much they support government intrusions into people's personal lives and personal business: What's the catch?

Amash might be right… but let's be realistic. Even if he were, most Americans probably don't consider the Fourth Amendment as anything other than a personal privacy protection. It covers the rights of both citizens and non-citizens alike, and the government has little to no need to conduct searches of records of every citizen. After all, most of us who are aware of the U.S. Constitution would agree that this is a document written for people who have not yet figured out how to write it legally.

As our government's ability to conduct surveillance expands ever-closer upon every American, it is essential that we ensure there aren't any barriers in place to the U.S. government from collecting the data we collect. And if the government is actually looking for evidence that a state is misusing information for their political purposes, a fair number of people would think Congress should be the one to do it.

It could all be fixed! Congress, if you're reading this: get serious about ensuring that we have the right to do something without government interference, even though we don't",1
"Will FBI Director Comey’s October Surprise Derail Hillary’s White House Bid? in: Government , Special Interests (image credit: AP) Having closed his earlier investigation into Hillary’s use of her private email server for classified State Department documents without bringing charges, dismissing indictable evidence, it’s hard imagining a shift of agency policy now. So what’s going on? Is FBI Director Comey trying  to make the Clintons look even worse? Or did Clinton’s server’s performance have the effect of creating more accountability in government that would have gone unnoticed at first glance? (A similar discussion took place in 2011 when Hillary’s private email server was uncovered; see here.) And we are going to know just one thing: this is not the way to keep our government accountable—no matter how the FBI Director wants you to believe’but it has been his role in determining the proper policies and procedures to utilize in our government to take care of the American people and their country. So this brings us to the next question: How do we make sure that these policies and procedures aren•–•-• do not create such unnecessary and undesirable consequences of an FBI director who should be performing the job of carrying out the law―–―–―–―–―–•–•, the best that we could do for our Constitution? We don―t know—and it will likely be a question for Justice Department to answer over the next few weeks about the case against Secretary Clinton as charged. But our expectation is that this will take the form of investigating and ultimately charging these individuals with violating federal law (and maybe some state law) on many occasions, and that the Justice Department will issue a response to all who may object to the prosecution •-•–•—•–•—•—•–‭ of Hillary―-‍‑—––‭—–—--–—-. This may be something more substantive than the sort of administrative law charges that could be filed—which have typically required discovery, which can take forever if the accused is trying to raise a defense—unless, indeed, the Government decides to pursue the charges aggressively for the obvious reason that there is a public interest if these individuals are brought back to justice for the criminal acts alleged or if they are convicted on these charges and sentenced to prison or both. So far, the Government has been reluctant to take these charges seriously. However, we believe that a special investigation with an independent prosecutorial team capable of examining the specific factual issues raised, the appropriate standards and guidelines set for prosecution, and the legal issues raised by some of these cases could be helpful in providing guidance in the absence of any formal charges. Finally, it could mean the Department would make some changes to its legal and prosecutorial standards to bring cases as close as is possible",1

The new ruling is part of an ongoing wave of similar legal victories around the world.

The case involved the case of Edward Snowden. He was a former contractor working in the United States, helping agencies develop surveillance programs. As part of his employment, he was given access to vast amounts of information about U.S. citizens and foreign entities by the NSA (along with the other agencies he worked for). This information included phone numbers, emails, Internet search history and much more.

By virtue of his legal status as an American citizen, he knew, for example, what his phone number was sent to, and knew whether that number had been associated with any illegal activity from that standpoint. According to court documents, Snowden's phone number was also in use by others, including one colleague, who had received the same number. In exchange for his cooperation, his name and whereabouts were supplied in the NSA's collection records.

The court ultimately found that his information was properly stored and stored for over five years. While he did give up his right to privacy and informed the NSA about the program, the government never obtained a court order to compel the contents of his communication records.

This case does not suggest that the United States government can gather information from all citizens without being able to gain a court order, nor should they. The new ruling is about the need for the U.S. government to use reasonable, non-arbitrary means to help it better protect its",1

Subban says he still believes in the Canadiens and that he will play out the remainder of the season there or join the New York Rangers. But as for what he sees for next season?

""I am still going to have a full season to do well in Montreal and continue to develop in North America,"" said the 31-year-old. ""I am just going to have to get there and it is going to take time. The Canadiens are going to see how I play and what I am going to try out, but it is going to be a lot of hard work.""

In 2015-16, Subban spent most of the year with the New York Rangers after signing a two-year, $14-million contract on Jan. 29, 2015. He was among New York's top two goal scorers, scoring 26 points in 82 games, and went on to earn his first Pro-Am award; he finished 18th among scorers while leading the team in scoring twice. In the playoffs he posted 27 points in 25 games; in the NRC he had 28.

Subban's playing career ended after a couple of injuries early in the 2016-17 season, with him finishing last in the league with a 54.4 Corsi percentage in 39 games; it appears that his offensive prowess has returned as he posted a career-best 58 points in 77 games and leads all of the Montreal Canadiens in points in 2016-17.

Subban, who has just over 12 years and $84-million remaining on his contract, said he is determined to make the Canadiens this season and that ""even if they are winning, or winning at a good pace."" Even so, he said it will be a difficult time for himself.

""I just have to get there and play and just see how it goes, whatever it is, whatever it is I try to prove to myself that it is worth it for me to put my energy into this club,"" he said.

As for the Rangers, ""I think people who are here in New York will be happy to see me,"" he said. ""(I am), in a way, happy to have been traded here a couple of days ago. When you are traded, there is a feeling that '",1
"Michael Moore Owes Me $4.99 28, 2016 | Reviews Michael Moore in New York City's Union Square Barnes & Noble to discuss his book Here Comes Trouble , September 13, 2011 ( David Shankbone / CC BY 3.0 ) Michael Moore’s “Trumpland” is a textbook illustration of how the mindset of voting for “the lesser  of two evils“ can be corrosive to democratic institutions and to political discourse overall. It is also a lesson to teach to parents, who may already be feeling overwhelmed by the number of options open to them and their own children's minds. While I have not seen Michael Moore's videos since his movie about the 9/11 attacks, which I highly recommend, I have read a great deal of his writings and written about him on this blog and at the American Enterprise Institute and at his web site, on the History Channel, and on several radio programs (especially on his podcast with Glenn Greenwald). His most recent book is Here Comes Trouble about George Bush's 2000 victory, and I will review his book to see if he offers an insightful, critical analysis of the current crisis. I agree with what he claims about the Bush administration and the ""false flag terror attacks"" of 9/11. We have, after all, spent many years trying to convince our fellow Americans that 9/11 was an attack on Islam. The 9/11 Commission Report confirms this conclusion. Indeed, its conclusions are also remarkably persuasive. That they should exist at all is a testimony to the fact that American democracy has been undermined for decades by the same flawed thinking, which is a major reason why many in the political climate today share, in the words of the late Senator Patrick Leahy, the belief that ""the election of Barack Obama is the single greatest threat to our national identity."" (See below for a list of recent books by Michael Moore. There are others who agree.)


Michael Moore's recent film The Prophet‪ by “James “Dixon“ has been shown in various video versions over the last two years, with varying results. If one looks closely it really does demonstrate Moore's worldview. It seems to show how “the prophet“ of radical Islam “actually” represents what the world looks like when things like terrorism are allowed to go unchecked. He is a man of many different views who is willing to say anything to advance his interests. In The Prophet , he even takes credit for setting a precedent for such a situation. However, he is also a Muslim: “I am“the “ex“ “exalted“ “ex“ “exalted“ “exalted“ “the “man“ “the “ex“ “exalted“ “exalted“ “exalted“ “",1

After last week's mass shooting at San Bernardino, Calif., it became evident to me there's a big gap between our rhetoric about gun control and reality.

We often say we want laws that aren't going to do a thing about gun violence, when actually that's precisely what we're doing. We'll make sure that they are effective and enforceable, and we will try to find sensible ways to restrict access to it, but we won't do something to make the violent tendencies of the criminal justice system become even worse.

Here's a quick rundown of some of the gun control measures that already exist but only seem to have gotten worse at the government level.

Massachusetts' Ban on Handguns, a $5,000 fine

The Massachusetts state government passed a law in 2014 that banned the purchase of handguns by those under the age of 18. This meant that anyone 17 years old, but not yet able to take class 11 or under, could not buy a gun without parental consent. Many people have filed suit against the state claiming that their guns weren't stolen by law enforcement—that the restriction only made those guns more available to criminals. The federal government is not happy about it, since it seems to make the sale of guns much more difficult.

New York's Background Investigation Requirement

In September 2015, a New York judge struck down a law that required people at the state and federal level to carry background investigations that were free of charge to check for mental health problems or other serious mental disorders before they could buy firearms. The court ruled that the law violated due process and equal protection rights. So does anyone think New York will be able to enforce this, as a state law already requires background checks for private sales of almost all firearms?

I've posted the original footage below – I hope it's not deleted, if not, it was just in case the original user had deleted the whole thing. I've also attached a screen grab, from TMZ‸ of the idiot's voice over the video, from the July 12 edition of MSNBC.

Now, there's no way to tell if the video is real. There's no way to know what was in it, exactly. But I do know it's not funny, and I'm sad that we live in a country where someone could do this in front of America's most famous President. Maybe he couldn't have thought to delete or put a censor on the video, so he went ahead and took credit for the post. Or there are videos on YouTube of Trump and others making funny videos about the Clintons, or Obama, or the Iraq war,※ or, as you can probably predict, Hillary Clinton– I bet it's worse than that.<|endoftext|>The UK's only official 'safe pair' condom should prevent a pregnancy from beginning, a woman's rights group says.

"Before The Great Flood 8 Kings Ruled Earth For 241,200 Years “…In 5 cities 8 kings; they ruled for 241,200 years. Then the flood swept over…” that is written on the first part of the Sumerian King List. But how is it possible for eight kings to rule for a period of 241,200 years? If we take a look at the  chronology, the kings ruled for a total of 241,200 years, but just two decades of that time in one part of the earth. Only six years and six years and one year. But what about the two decades in between the reigns, the 10 years between the reigns? In just 3 years, the king of the Sumerians ruled for 1.3 million years!‟ And the king of Babylon was one of those kings, so he ruled for 1.2 million years. Only about a decade of this decade was enough for all the important events which happened in the world during this period!‟ The king of Egypt, also wrote the Sumerian history, as far back as 1,200 years ago, the city-states became independent, but by then they had grown and developed in numbers, it was a great civilization. Then Sumer fell and the whole world was plunged into darkness, then they became weak and powerless. At that time the Babylonians ruled over the rest of the world. Their city-states disappeared too.” So, if these three kings managed to rule for 41,200 years, one hundred six years, that means they controlled everything, including everything about nature—in their minds. It is true, it is possible that in those 40 years they were not able to have the power that they imagined in that first year of 241,200 years, but they were able to keep everything, such as the food they ate, their knowledge of nature, their knowledge of religion, the knowledge of their gods, the knowledge of their kings and the knowledge of the secrets of the earth—that was their secret, which they kept. So what does nature think? What do the gods think when they think about it?‟ There are many interesting things that the gods are able to do and these are some of this knowledge: They can give out their secrets to humans.‟ They are capable of transforming what they consider good into evil, but they have the power to do that.‟ They can change the laws of nature into what they consider bad.‟ There are times when they are aware of certain things, but some of them they cannot control, because it would be contrary to the rules of nature. Even in the world of nature things are not always done according to the rules of nature.‟ There are times when you must use special methods in order to control things.‟ There are times when something changes so suddenly it seems impossible to control.

"Collapsing: Why the ‘Russia Hack’ Witch Hunt Will Not End Well for Congress, or America 21st Century Wire says Washington s Russian witch hunt is now collapsing before our eyes. As host Patrick Henningsen revealed last Wednesday on ACR Radio, the supposedly damning information submitted by the FBI s private cyber security contractor Crowdstrike, of which the entire Russian Hack conspiracy theory hinges on is  either false or mis-attributed to the Obama Administration. In fact, it is so badly skewed that the document clearly clearly indicates the Russians are behind the most massive espionage operation in history – including election meddling, mass cyber warfare, and nuclear weapons. We now have evidence that this was a fake hack and not part of something larger. The FBI has admitted that this had nothing to do with the US election – or anything else, for that matter. And since no evidence has been offered to show that Russian hackers really compromised anything or even that they caused a lot of damage, there is no possible way of knowing what is really going on. Even worse, the FBI conceded the evidence that the Russians hacked the Democrats in the election is simply not real. What is real and what isn't is just entirely unclear to those working on this case. And that is the real issue in this affair as it affects both the US political and security establishments. As the Washington Post reported yesterday, this is now effectively a criminal investigation into the entire Russian political opposition, meaning that it is all being conducted by the same agencies investigating the Clinton campaign. We can see that at the highest levels of the Obama administration and its intelligence apparatus. For example, on Friday, ABC News reported that former NSA contractor Edward Snowden could potentially face extradition to the US under the Espionage Act. He is believed to be holed up in Moscow . And just this week, it was reported that the CIA and FBI will be sharing secret cyber tools and techniques with each other. These developments come on top of reports of the CIA s secret cyberwar on the Russian government s information gathering capabilities . If you remember, the Russians actually used CIA cyber tools to hack the Democratic National Committee in 2015, targeting the organization's servers and computers. This is a serious concern and it is clear that the Obama administration does not want to deal with such serious charges. We also have the ongoing WikiLeaks affair which has become a major national security scandal in a number of respects. Last week it was reported that Edward Snowden and a team of journalists may in fact have been working for WikiLeaks at the time of the 2016 election. It was also reported earlier that the US government may soon announce charges against Julian Assange , the head of the whistleblowing organization , in Sweden. Julian Assange has been charged with sex crime and attempted rape , as the New York Times notes . It appears he has been hiding away from the United States at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for years . Wikileaks also claims in one of their most recent filings that the Russian government",1

The 22-year-old has been given his first taste of first-team football by Steve Sidwell (Wigan Athletic), while manager Chris Ashton remains optimistic of signing another striker in the summer.

Livorno have also held talks with Chelsea over Nenad Jaric, but the Belgian's transfer to Inter Milan may have been put back for January, sources have told BBC Radio Bristol.

It would mean that Everton will not be getting Joleon Lescott and could also see their deal for striker Edin Dzeko rejected if their £35-million bid for the Montenegrin is not agreed.

Chelsea and Manchester United are both believed to be monitoring Joris' future, with both parties keen for this loan deal to be terminated when the player becomes available in January.

Plunkett announced in April that Swansea City had also made an interest in Lescott, while he and the Swans' owner, Richard Cockerill, have both been impressed by the player's performances under current Blues boss Ashley Williams.

"UNsilenced: Whistleblower Exposes UN Culture of Corruption Email When she stumbled across massive corruption and made-up statistics in her job at the United Nations, Rasna Warah knew she needed to act. But when she tried to blow the whistle, she was viciously attacked, publicly humiliated, threatened, intimidated, and more. Unfortunately, though, as Warah explains in her new  book, ""A Girl from Iraq"" (Nation), it's often not that easy: ""What you really need to hear about is the victims.""

She and her colleagues didn't just expose fraud at the UN — Warah was one of the earliest to expose that fraud at the private military contractors Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics (the latter of which donated millions to the Clinton Foundation and has received millions from the U.S. military and government entities). Instead, as Warah told AlterNet at an event hosted by the Center for Media and Democracy in Washington, DC, ""we had to expose what you call gross misconduct, and in doing so expose the corruption that is occurring when the UN does this work.""

Her book is a kind of mini-documentary documentary film from which she takes readers through different aspects of the UN — including how it exploits its own staff so that the organization can make money like other charities with a large staff but a weak or nonexistent budget and, thus, does not have to meet or even compete with the very rich and famous at the United Nations. For example, a documentary Warah created with help from the United Nations' investigative division — the Inspector General for the UN — uncovered many allegations about the massive budget that the organization sets aside for its personnel, including the fact that there are several other UN agencies, the African Development Bank (ADB), which operates similar funding streams to the UN, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which handles money for countries at the UN that are in need of reconstruction or reconstruction-related support.

But all of the cases that Warah documented in her reporting were ""not about making money at the UN,"" she said in the interview. Instead, ""we wanted to be able to make a very sharp critique of what our colleagues at the UN were doing in the same way I did — to actually make us look at the corruption."" She told AlterNet that the UN's transparency department is the largest private sector contractor of the U.N.'s official communications, giving it access to information that its private sector partners couldn't get (although other private sector partners have used their position at the UN to spy on the UN and to gather information on other NGOs and U.N. personnel, as well). The UN also has an independent human rights inspector and the UN director General can remove UN officials.

And that's just the first issue. Even in its larger missions within the UN, which includes funding projects overseas, the UN, the",1
"“IN YOUR FACE”: OBAMA LAUNCHES NEW #RefugeesWelcome Twitter Campaign On Twitter Never mind that a new poll shows Americans oppose bringing Syrian Refugees to America by a 2-1 margin! Carry on King Barry to hell with the American people For five days a coordinated DC Media has been attacking as racists anyone opposed to President Obama s plan to resettle thousands  of Syrian refugees, including families with children. This is the exact same media that has just claimed that ISIS is still a threat — except for a few radical Islamic terrorists left on the fringe — who have declared war on America. Even though there have been no confirmed ISIS attacks in the U.S. — and even though there are currently 4,800 American troops in Iraq and Syria that are not part of the ISIS, as we speak the military offensive against ISIS continues apace, and there were no credible attacks in the U.S. until recently. So when this group is labeled racist, it's because they consider blacks and other minorities to be an enemy, rather than simply the victims of bad policies.

Now, this kind of racist hatred is not unique to the white-slavery-lady-war-on-women, but unfortunately the media's agenda has been moving to the left quite frequently lately. In February a report from The Washington Post revealed that Hillary Clinton had been receiving dozens of emails from the Russian Ambassador that included material from the infamous Steele dossier accusing Russia of paying Clinton to have sex with a Russian government official – a charge made by the DNC's own internal watchdog.

Then when the Democratic National Committee tried to stop that ""Russian collusion"" rumor, they were ""muzzled"" by the Sanders campaign. Even the head of the FBI (James Comey) has admitted that he did not get access to any material and that he had been told not to write anything so damning about Russia. When it emerged that the FBI was investigating this very same rumor and then decided not to go forward with such a probe, Sanders won handily in the primary. The Clinton campaign has already claimed that their sources were the Russians.

The fact is there is no proof that Russia engaged in hacking to influence the election, though we do have plenty of circumstantial evidence to suggest that Trump voters were not solely Trump voters. A review of social media shows evidence of Hillary and Sanders supporters tweeting ""Lock her up!"" before the election ended. This certainly isn't an exhaustive list of people who were anti-Hillary Clinton for the simple reason that even anti-Hillary Clinton Republicans were saying, ""That crazy bitch Hillary Clinton is a horrible human being who would never even consider running for office again."" It's one thing to find a couple of people saying this as Sanders supporters do, but to make up for all of these Republicans whose support Trump received? That seems like a real stretch, especially since Trump is a proven liar and",1

Brave or promiscuous is a label given to those individuals who have committed suicide, and that could be you. It is not my decision for you to use or decide for yourself whether or not you are a BPD trans woman. My hope in being with you today is to learn about your desires, concerns, and goals, and, if you choose to be a part of the trans community, to learn more.

"ANOTHER CLINTON CASUALTY? Sister Of Woman Who Allegedly Had Photos Proving Affair With Bill Clinton, Questions His Involvement In Her Mysterious House Fire Death As more and more women line up to tell their stories about sex with Bill Clinton both consensual and forced there is one who is unable to relive the details of her alleged affair.Penthouse Pet Judi Gibbs died in a mysterious house fire in 1986 amid rumors that she had  attempted to kill herself. According to reports, she was a star on TV, married and running a successful law practice before taking her own life in the early hours of May 25th 1986.

What is known is that she met David Brock, a prominent lefty writer and provocateur who was known to be a friend of Bill Clinton's and the creator of the Clinton Chronicles website before Bill decided he was not interested. He decided that he would have a bit more fun and was looking forward to an opportunity to be on CNN.

But instead of joining CNN to talk about how well she really felt about Bill, David Brock chose to go off the deep end to destroy a life who was trying so very hard to save it.

David Brock had no interest in talking about what his wife was doing. He saw a problem with the Clintons story and decided to take matters into his own hands with his plan. When he confronted the Clintons with questions they couldn't answer in the public eye, he came up with a plan.

After being unable to talk to the Clintons or even his attorney, David Brock decided to call up Bill about his plan and find someone to talk to. In what appeared to be a call to action for other people to help David Brock with his plan, he was met with the following:

""I hope it gets out that we are going to have to sue you.""

""You will be sued if we sue you.""

""We are going to be suing you.""

""Well, if you really believe in something you might as well believe in it even if it comes at a cost.""

""Who does it cost? Is that going to be a problem?""

David Brock did not stop with that. He then threatened the Clintons that if he was sued, that they would have to pay money to the law firm's lawyers because of the publicity.

Now, why would Bill Clinton be asked for money in the wake of the Paula Jones case?

At 1 in the afternoon on June 18th, Paula Jones entered a guilty plea under house arrest in Little Rock Arkansas. Bill Clinton and his staff had been secretly recording the meeting so that they could document it during the course of her criminal trial. Paula's plea was not that a crime had been committed against her. She had actually been convicted when Bill's staff tried to videotape a private conversation between Paula Jones and her lawyer and it turned out to not be the one they intended.

A bit of internet magic and a few Hollywood stars will jump in and get a shout-out (or, perhaps, shout-out, no). The name gets tossed around and often you hear about the ""Big Bang Theory"" star who got a shout-out because, well, because she's on Top.

Well, that didn't happen. Instead, we got the names behind these names, and we decided that the name of a famous actor should be featured prominently enough that if an actor were to use it on the big screen, they'd need to get their name up there in the film's credits.

We asked these actors to give us their tips on naming their characters – and then we took your suggestions for a look at a few celebrity names that would make for a hilarious movie poster – for your inspiration.

Teddy Bridgewater by Chris Osten is clearly the guy playing Mr. Bridgewater on ""Top Boy.""

Bridgewater, who's married to singer/songwriter Miley Cyrus, is clearly in it for the Money.

""We're in it for making some money and getting the most out of our time in the studio. He's trying to get in on it. This guy makes millions of dollars doing movies and stuff, so this is kind of what he's in it for,"" said Osten of Bridgewater. ""I don't think I'd let this guy off too easy.""

Laurie Metcalfe by Jessica Biel is a ""Wrecking Ball"" to those of us who love the title character on ""The Dark Knight.""

"LOL! DEMOCRATS’ “Poster Child For Stupidity” Can’t Tell MSNBC Host What Her Party Stands For Besides Hating Trump [VIDEO] Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) struggled Friday on MSNBC to explain what the Democratic Party stands for besides opposing President Trump.Waters has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in Congress, repeatedly calling for his impeachment and insisting that if investigators connect the dots, then his campaign s played too much influence over the Trump administration's foreign policy, and the President himself.But that's all in the past now, she said, and she's in favor of the policies of the Trump administration.""I would have done the same thing if [Rep.] Adam Schiff had made the allegation in connection with the investigations into Russia and Russia's election interference,"" Waters said. ""I've been on the record supporting that from first day on. … I was with the President on his election day before he was inaugurated, and if you look on the president's platform, and you listen to what he has said on Twitter… he has no doubt it's the case that he wants to move forward with the Russia investigation.

Most of the foreign-financed NGOs that have managed to operate in Thailand for over two decades, and the amounts of money that they have received from abroad, are the result of an informal network of networks and networks of intermediaries operating under several branches such as NGO-run businesses and NGO-run schools.

The report said that the presence in Thailand was mainly due to the fact that many people living overseas work as NGOs in Thailand who were interested in assisting and contributing to the country. The increase in Thai NGOs also comes from a variety of factors. Over the past 2 decades, some 1,000 foreign-funded organizations have contributed around 1,800 million TEN THB. (approximately US$1.7 billion) of NGO-managed funding, making for a large volume of foreign-financed NGOs.

""This growing number of foreign organizations is a reflection of many people who believe they are acting altruistically through humanitarian activity. However, the reality is that much of the funding is coming from foreign governments, foundations and private individuals in countries like the US, the UK, the US, and France. It is a very good sign that there is growing attention on the need for more financial incentives for international humanitarian workers and that foreign NGOs are starting to adopt ethical practices to help alleviate poverty rather than simply profit off of humanitarian activities.

""The number of Thai-funded NGOs operating in Thailand is also in sharp contrast to the",1
" Trump THREATENS Comey Via Twitter In His Most Autocratic Move Yet Donald Trump has some very scary authoritarian instincts. He regularly makes it his mission to discredit and attack the free press, has nothing but contempt for our Constitution and our system of checks and balances, and he and his officials regularly lie and spread propaganda to the American public. Now,  what does that have to do with China? Well, it's very simple,"" Spicer said. ""Donald Trump and his administration constantly lie. It takes a lot of energy and determination for them to say some crazy stuff on television and broadcast that they've thought through, and what about President Xi Jinping of China? President Xi was at that White House last January for a press conference. When the reporter pointed out a tweet that the president had tweeted before going to the White House, Mr. Xi, as a member of the CCP, simply said, 'Oh, you mean he's a U.S. citizen,' and said, 'This White House has nothing to do with that. Our White House is just a normal State Guest House.'"" He added, ""China is an emerging security threat to the United States which is why China, with its billions of people, has been investing billions of dollars in developing their own capabilities and military capabilities in these areas and in cyber defenses, and they think this is going to cause some serious consequences if it turns out that it was directed by the President of the United States.""

On the economy

Spicer said it's an old argument that America needs to spend more and faster rather than work to achieve long-term prosperity. ""One of the really great successes of the Obama years was that we saw record job growth, record job creation,"" he said. ""There's a way that we can restore some of that growth."" He said that's one thing President Trump, ""is doing well is we are working to get this economy growing again. We've been able to move up the pace of the economy and we need a growth rate that reflects that."" Spicer said Trump's proposals are the ""most realistic thing to accomplish"" in the next three years.

He added: ""As far as China, I think Mr. Trump has been very consistent in what he says, he wants the United States to be more economically competitive. And frankly, for the last three years, you know the U.S. economy has been basically flatlining. And we can go back to the policies of prior administrations and we will do much better. In fact, we are doing better than the Obama administration, by the way, and I think the American people understand that better than I ever have. … I think the president has been consistent in the policies that he has laid out. And he's talked to a lot of people and he's talked in lots of detail about his economic plans. We have a very detailed",1

Today, the film has officially landed itself in theaters.

The Last Man on Earth marks the return to theaters of Unexpected director Justin Kurzel, who has been working toward a follow-up starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Zachary Quinto for well over a year. However, the film hasn't officially opened for months due to the studio trying to renegotiate that contract with Paramount. While The Last Man on Earth wasn't announced as an announcement to date, it does seem that the studio is hoping to start filming sometime next month. The Last Man on Earth was rumored for a May 2018 release, and now we could be getting our first look at the film if all goes according to plan.

That's the question posed by the University of New Hampshire, USA, as part of a joint study that involved surveying 526 people about how their personal lives have changed over the past 30 or 50 years.

The findings, published in the June 17 print edition of the journal Psycholinguistics, showed a sharp divide between the majority and the other group.

One-third of the country — that's 1 in 5 Americans— were born in 1950 or before, up from 1 in 10 in 1990, the study found. Those born in 1950 experienced higher levels of racial discrimination, the study found, although this wasn't statistically significant. (See TIME's interactive map showing how the nation has changed over the past 30 years.)

It appeared that racial and gender discrimination increased at a much faster rate in the 1970s than it has done in the decades since. As a result, ""the racial/ethnic makeup of college-educated whites and Asians has steadily grown over the past two decades, while the number of non-college educated whites has declined substantially,"" the paper showed. (For more on how people got out of college, pick up TIME's fall issue.)

The Israeli military hit the rocket from Gaza earlier today but it appears the projectile landed at an uninhabited agricultural land near the entrance. The incident is the latest salvo in a long-running conflict between the extremist Islamic organization and its Jewish and Israeli adversaries on the ground.

""The rocket targeted our [Israeli] forces, and landed at a densely populated area, destroying or damaging many infrastructure as a result.""

It was the first time Israeli war planes have carried out an attack on Gaza since the operation at the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights ended with Hamas shelling two days ago.

The Israeli military said it launched an air campaign in response to the rockets in an offensive that included airstrikes, tanks and soldiers taking positions inside Gaza-Egypt tunnel systems, all of which are being monitored by the Egyptian military.

Meanwhile, reports emerged today that the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza will be shut down until Friday evening for the rest of the week due to the worsening of the humanitarian situation.

The Hamas armed wing, al-Qassam's al-Zawiya media center published an online message saying that Hamas was ordering the closure of the al-Shifa hospital, located on a large landmass where most people of Gaza are displaced.

""We ask the [international community] to support Palestinian resistance in calling the establishment of a national hospital in the town and a medical college so as to bring health to millions of people, especially women and children.""

In the same news release al-Qassam claimed that Israeli military bases from Eilat to Gaza may be targeted during Saturday's Gaza conflict. They also say that a Palestinian group called Shajaa is responsible for kidnapping four Israeli soldiers and their security forces.

The organization released a video on social media showing the military launching an airstrike on the al-Shifa hospital's operating room and killing four people inside in a raid meant to ""send a message to the Israeli government.""

Israeli officials said the al-Shifa hospital and school — a home, day-care center, a pharmacy",1

There's nothing worse than seeing a woman wearing a dress and suddenly wondering how she could have ever chosen it without noticing the big gap between the hips and the floor.

Ahem, sorry, but there are a lot of big gaps between the girls' thighs and even on a normal woman's body, but they don't count as large when it comes to getting a ""butt"" in on the action, right? Right? I don't get it...

And while I'll understand it if a guy wanted to see a woman wearing a dress as long as it didn't look like it got a butt, I don't get why you just let women and girls try wearing anything other than their regular clothes or a sexy blouse and panties, right?

I guess some men will just be more comfortable with women ""doing anything"". It's the same reason why male and female soldiers are similar to each other, but women have to fight and die to protect a country. As such, they're usually in the uniform for a very long time and only need to have a small change the second they come.


I can understand why women wouldn't put on sexy clothing, but when a man doesn't fit that mould, how can I blame them for wanting to have it? Why can't this be changed?

Well it seems like most guys, even men who've had a few women on their team do wear underwear as a male partner would, but we can't have it both ways.

The blame for the injuries suffered and murders of innocent law enforcement officers falls squarely on the shoulders of Eric Holder, Eric Sharpton and Barack Hussein Obama . The hatred for our law enforcement must end.""

But according to the report by The Daily Caller, in a series of calls to the New York Times and MSNBC, civil rights groups argue the situation is dire in America.

""The FBI is in crisis in many communities all over this country, but the New York state bureau of criminal investigation is seeing a surge in terrorism-related deaths because of a perceived shift to more militant Islamist forces,"" the group said. ""For example, the death of American journalist James Foley last week in the ISIS-held city of Raqqa was apparently connected to a report that a terrorist from New Jersey had recently been sent to Syria there.""

The Daily Caller said the number of Americans who have traveled to Syria to fight is ""entirely disproportionate."" And, in several instances, the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security are refusing to turn over any of this information.

""This type of behavior is not new, and it's only going to get worse,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee said. ""This is no excuse for inaction. As I have said in the past, we need to see the FBI investigate and bring to justice those responsible for these terrible attacks on our country.""

Calls for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to review its policies on the weapons and ammunition used by law enforcement officials are part of a larger demand that more resources be directed toward the problem of gun violence.

The report from the report.com said the problem lies on both sides of the issue and that both sides have been slow to act.

""The real focus, in my view, should be and is on the root causes behind the increasing violence,"" the website said. ""The gun manufacturers and the gun dealers don't want to fix this problem, so either they're looking at criminal justice reform that makes it illegal to own a gun, like the assault weapons ban and the ban on certain guns or they're trying to change the gun laws of the country, which, at least legally, allow you to sell guns legally to those who are not licensed gun dealers but in a state that makes such things impossible by their laws.""<|endoftext|>One of the most controversial aspects of this new technology is the new generation of smartwatches that have been designed specifically for outdoor use.

"The World Sees a Diminished America The World Sees a Diminished America November 13, 2016 While there is hope that President Trump will end the bloody years of U.S. adventurism abroad, the initial shock from his victory could diminish America’s standing in the world, says ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar. By Paul R. Pillar The impact  of Donald Trump's victory on American democracy and its future will be felt for years to come — the world is still reeling and the United States is still the least powerful nation on earth. American society today has much to learn from and learn from American institutions. It is only by re-thinking the way we conduct our foreign policy that it can begin to develop a more positive vision of what happens in the world. Trump's victory could reduce America's influence, weaken it in the world, and increase our vulnerability. But before then American institutions need to learn to engage with a new national consensus — and with reality. We don't have an elected leader on either side of the ideological divide. Trump's win signals a national consensus of more skeptical views — which is what will allow America to continue to have a clear path in international affairs. But first, there needs to be an honest reckoning with the realities that made America vulnerable to the Soviet Union's collapse in 1989‒and the realities that led it to the brink of total collapse. That reckoning won't be easy. The stakes are enormous, but Americans are capable of making tough choices. For instance, many people have said that it is in American society's self-interest to vote for Trump. For these people, and others who do not share such an attachment, America must take care of itself by looking to others in Europe to lead the way toward sustainable global prosperity. The key here is that America is not facing insurmountable challenges on its home front today. The most important challenges we face today are global trade problems and climate change. American prosperity and security are at stake. We need to invest in America's security first, even if that means putting the interests of our own citizens at risk. President Trump must also make clear to all Americans that if they want the prosperity they earned, they can still achieve that prosperity by working together. This is what I called the American Dream back in 1986. We all knew that dream — that America could lift people out of poverty without relying on their government. We had the best jobs in the world. American business was so successful that it didn't matter if we had the same kinds of taxes or regulation that we imposed on foreign competition that we imposed on our own business. Americans have been able to continue to have high incomes. And for almost 20 years, millions of Americans have been able to stay in shape and to have the same type of quality of life we enjoy now. But there is one part of the American dream that hasn't existed for decades: It was",1
"CONSERVATIVE Has Message For “DREAMERS” Screaming “He’s not my President!” and It’s HILARIOUS! Remember when illegal aliens, students, and residents of Berkeley took to the streets to march in solidarity, and publicly affirm that President Donald Trump is Not my President! ? It s really not surprising to see ILLEGAL ALIENS boldly chanting He s not my President! after our former president promised  to not deport undocumented immigrants from the United States. I think it is very telling that they have continued to rally at Trump Tower while our President refuses to release his immigration order. Perhaps our current President is going to be forced to answer some tough questions from citizens on how Trump is going to deport his supporters.

"Comment on Facebook Daughter’s Day Hoax Is A Sign Of The Times by para kazanmak Subscribe My daughter and me Yesterday was National Daughter’s Day! I know this because Facebook told me so; well, maybe not Mark Zuckerberg himself, but all my friends on Facebook were posting pictures of their daughters and celebrating National Daughter’s Day so it must be true, right? Actually, I Googled  and searched for ""National Daughter's Day 2017"", and there were actually lots of posts about it. I even found a couple of articles and some links for you to do it yourself if you're interested. But what did I find that would be so inspiring? It was a post of my own, the one that really got me thinking about how I celebrate National, rather than personal, Day of the Year.
What do you see? National Day, what does that mean to you? So in this post, we will explore how to celebrate National Day with myself! I would like to give you a little intro to how I celebrate it as a person, for my daughter, and maybe to someone else as well. I'll start with the picture above, as that is something I do when National Day comes along every year…
So what is National Day? National Day is a term that comes from the official proclamation of President George H.W. Bush, who gave it to the United States of America on July 4, 1942 in The United States of America, by the President, on behalf of God the Father and of All the Saints. In the proclamation, he said,
… To mark the National Day of the National Republic, I hereby proclaim July 4th as National Day of Peace, Humility, Service, and Independence.
""Honor and respect for the human body, its resources, and its laws – in this world and in the realm of heaven; the right of citizens, citizens-at-large and members of the community – to be free from fear and from oppression from authority; the dignity of human life without limits; the sanctity and worth of human life.""
That's it. It's the same words that George H.W. Bush always uses to say what is so important – respect, honor and peace, right? Or is it that honor, peace and dignity are one and the same?
That's the question I want you to ask yourself.
At the end of the day, what is National Day? It is what we all strive for every day of our lives, right? What if we want to take home every moment that we have, and celebrate that, right? Or is National Day just something to celebrate with friends and family on National Day? Or what if we want some time to relax and remember to feel proud of who we are, our country and even our friends? Today we do what all people of all ages, genders, racial groups, and nationalities should be doing",1

The Republican Party will never win the presidency if Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump get elected. Nor will Republicans win the war with ISIS and Russia over the next two years.

There is no such thing as a Trump presidency. The Republicans cannot be trusted to get anything done in government. They will go to war with each other unless we do something about the impending crisis.

This is a revolution. A struggle for survival. We are here to win. We cannot have the Republican Party as our leader. In fact, we cannot even have our own party with a majority in the House to begin with.

So I am asking, who would you rather put in the place of your President: Bill Clinton, John McCain, or Donald Trump?

This is my challenge to the GOP, and the Republican Party has no room for me. I will never leave with a majority in the House, unless Trump becomes President, and gets the Democrats to change the rules for the presidency to give him the votes from both the House and the Senate.

There are three ways we can defeat Trump, Bill Clinton and John McCain:

First, let's stop fighting over our rights. Let's stop fighting about how bad of a president it is to vote for Hillary Clinton. Let's not fight over who gets to be commander in chief when our nation goes to war in three years, and we've done almost 200 deaths and millions of refugees.

Second, Democrats must do what they were elected to do. The Republican party should end its crusade that the presidency is unimportant. It deserves more than anything else, and I will tell you why.

What I am telling you is: We will not give up. We will not give up. We will not give up on the most important issue in our national life. I do not want a President who looks and sounds like Bill Clinton, with a face like he did when he was campaigning in South Carolina two years ago for the primary in the primary, which Hillary won. So here is a hint, you do not want a President whose face you see every day at 9 o'clock at night, trying to get a job because the job has been left empty.

How it all began

It all started with a humble idea to create a fun-loving game with friends where you have to do your best to solve a variety of simple puzzles. At first the idea took some time to come together and build, and this is the result.


Our first game, Spam Island, was inspired by a real life experience where my brother and I got a bunch of spammers together and we worked on the puzzles in a way that kept them coming back until the end of their time. Afterward we went back and looked over more of the games we did that the Spam Island-makers might like and thought that it would make perfect for their family-friendly night. But then we realised that they were not the games we liked, rather they were the games that they got. So we thought, ""How about we try doing a really fun game where everyone just sits down and we try to solve the most complex puzzles together.""


From there the idea evolved until we created a game, a series of games, and a library of puzzles for kids. The first, Spam Isle, was our idea of how long it was going to take us before the kids at our school could actually play a Spam Island game. Afterwards, we were able to convince all the families in our local district to play as well, and now you are watching the game unfold. The next game, Spam Island 2, got its start as our idea of where it was going to take us on, and Spam Island 3 got its start as a kids' version of Spam Island 2, giving kids the opportunity to try our own creation as well as sharing our game with them.

We have grown to a little over 200 families, all of whom can be a little bit embarrassed watching all their friends' faces full of giggling as they go about the game. That's why we put a whole bunch of video behind the Spam-in-a-bowls on our Facebook page and other similar social media sites.<|endoftext|>The Supreme Court ruled Friday that states have to let residents who have committed suicide under emergency conditions get on life support, with the justices ordering the federal government to enforce the principle.

"BOMBSHELL: Justice Clarence Thomas Accused Of Sexual Misconduct (VIDEO) BOMBSHELL: Justice Clarence Thomas Accused Of Sexual Misconduct (VIDEO) By Karen Shiebler Way back in 1991, the news in this country was filled with stories of sexual harassment. Anita Hill was a young law professor who sat in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee as it debated the nomination  of Anita Hill to the Supreme Court. This case would set the tone for women's rights for decades to come. One reason she was criticized by so many was because a top lawyer she had hired was accused of raping her. The accusation was widely condemned in the press. However, Anita Hill's story began in 1986. In 1986, Hill began to receive unwelcome sexual advances at the hands of her male mentor--an Army lieutenant colonel--and was then raped by her fellow law professor. The story became so controversial that it prompted the Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to get involved. On September 5th, 1986--a week after the trial was already scheduled, and just a week after the trial had begun--Thomas received an anonymous letter addressed to him by an investigator--a private investigator--about the allegations made against Thomas. On September 9, 1986, Thomas received the memo and gave one of the most detailed interviews about the sexual misconduct reported to him by an investigator. Thomas was accused of groping and touching Hill. The next day, he was the subject of a major scandal, leading to allegations of sexual assault, battery and rape. After this, he announced he would step down as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Aging. Thomas testified that he would resign, though he would stay on as a law professor. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings with witnesses from his college (Hitchcock) and that of his law practice (Davis, White, Todras & Davis). In the end, two of the witnesses from the sexual harassment case were either later discredited or excoriated by other female colleagues. Thomas claimed, however, that he had been subjected to no serious negative behavior after his resignation. He blamed the Senate for holding hearings--which was never true. However, in 1992, a grand jury subpoenaed all of his legal records. Thomas was forced to withdraw, however, and was never charged with any serious wrongdoing. He retired from practicing law on October 2nd of the year in which the grand jury transcripts were revealed. It was after this grand jury investigation that Clarence Thomas was accused by Jane Doe No. 1, who claimed that he touched her inappropriately when she was a student at Chapman University and then became hostile when she was a faculty member in Lawrence. Thomas vehemently denied the allegations. But the scandal did go all the way to the Supreme Court. In 1991, the Supreme Court handed down the Anita Hill case. This time, the Justice, however, was not just accused of a crime against women. And the allegations were serious. Just",1
"CNN: One voter can make a difference by voting repeatedly Channel list Following hurricane Matthew's failure to devastate Florida, activists flock to the Sunshine State and destroy Trump signs manually Tim Kaine takes credit for interrupting hurricane Matthew while debating weather in Florida Study: Many non-voters still undecided on how they're not going to vote The Evolution of Dissent: on -lookers discuss how Trump isn't as 'polarizing' as he makes us believe Jeff Sharlet on why millennials are the future of politics

The event began with a demonstration, which included Trump supporters chanting for him to get the hell out of Florida, which had been in a two-day flood. Several members of the anti-Trump group Florida Right to Life showed up in suits and ties.

""Our city is flooded like hell,"" said Kathy McIlhaney, who carried a bag with a banner reading ""Donald Trump sucks"" and carrying an umbrella. ""Our governor is putting money where our mouths are.""

An activist with ACT for America, who had attended Trump's events in New York and Pennsylvania, took selfies with several of the participants — several posing for photos with a small white triangle emblazoned with Donald Trump's name across them, with a red ""F"" in the middle, across the bottom from it.

And when Trump appeared before reporters following his press conference on Sunday night, the man who helped create the sign reading ""Trump sucks"" was on hand wearing gloves when the press asked him his stance on the situation.

""I think he should have put a 'F' in the middle, and I think that we should stick it to him personally,"" said Daniel Bice, the pro-Trump volunteer who helped set up Trump's campaign signs at his campaign events in Philadelphia and at a local diner. ""I'll put it in the middle of any sign that says Donald Trump sucks or says 'f— you.'""

A former state senator from Sarasota also seemed to have endorsed the signs for Trump's rallies Monday, telling reporters at an event in Pensacola that ""I think it goes without saying that Donald Trump is a deplorable person.""

As of late Monday evening, FloridaRight to Life's online Facebook page had more than 8,000 likes and 12,000 shares, compared to less than 10,000 last Saturday.

According to his website, Trump's campaign slogan — ""Make America Great Again"" — is a play on Trump's slogan from the late 1930s, an old line popularized during the Great Depression after FDR used it in his famous slogan before World War II. The song became widely-known during the '30s and '40s and was popularized by Elvis Presley in 1962. (A 2008 review of the song by PopSci says the song ""is the most beloved song on every national anthem",1
"Comment on 7 Effective Ways To Balance Hormones Naturally by Eat Your Way to Balanced Hormones! - NeilMD.com Poor gut health and food allergies: More research is linking gut health to hormone regulation . Obesity Inflammation as a result of poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle Genetic susceptibility Toxicity in the form of exposure to pesticides, toxins, viruses, cigarettes, excessive alcohol, and harmful chemicals Excessive amounts of stress,  low intelligence, and low family income are all risk factors for many psychiatric illnesses Commonly called the ""food pyramid"" diet is common in industrialized nations of the developed world and a common feature of most popular Western diets.
What is the food pyramid? There is good evidence that eating too many of a diet may lead to weight gain and other health problems that may go untreated, as discussed in our prior studies, below.
Foods in the food pyramid are arranged in 5-star ""dense"" categories defined by their relative caloric, glycemic, and nutritional content. 1 This classification system is based on the American Heart Association's recommendation that the average American should eat about 250 grams of protein, 55 grams of fat, and 20 grams of carbohydrate - and that for individuals with diabetes, approximately 300 grams. (This is an arbitrary average and does not include additional nutrients and ingredients. It also does not include fiber, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and fish. If food does not look like this, it has not been adequately analyzed for nutrients, so it is not part of the typical food pyramid.) The 5-star food patterns often include high-carbohydrate, medium-sugar, grain-heavy, high-fat diets, and low-sugar, high-fat diets. One common argument for this system is to help people lose weight to ""gain health,"" but that argument is flawed. In fact, for an individual to lose weight, he or she must begin eating less overall than has historically been recommended as a goal. So long as one eats about half the recommended amount of ""normal,"" normal weight foods, one doesn't lose weight. The 10 most common reasons individuals lose weight, and how to effectively achieve those goals, are illustrated on the table below.
Food Patterns Food Patterns A few things to look for at restaurants and grocery stores in the United States: A) ""healthy"" choices - A lot of meat, fish, and eggs is included by weight, mostly chicken and seafood: a typical food with a high-quality recipe is listed at 5 stars but usually only 4 is listed as ""health food."" B) ""healthy"" and ""normal"" choices - The same list of unhealthy choices was listed at 4 stars but is usually only 1 is listed as ""health food."" C) Inappropriate and toxic options. As well-meaning people may sometimes eat healthy, fair food to get to the weight-loss goal, but they should not expect healthy and healthy eating in an upscale restaurant or a",1
"NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE Will Offer Cash To Schools To STOP Using Indian Mascots…While 1 IN 3 Native Americans Live In Poverty Native Americans continue to battle poverty, joblessness and low incomes. About 28.4 percent of American Indians and Alaska (1 in every 3) Natives nearly twice the national rate lived in poverty in 2010. Their unemployment hovers around 49 percent, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs most recent labor force  situation report released by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics that will be made available later this month.

Poverty and the decline of family incomes is clearly visible here in New Mexico and in all parts of the South, and it's not just affecting Black and Indigenous and poor communities of color as well as the poor, who also experience an alarming decrease in family-support-income support. The Census Bureau released a report earlier this month finding that the poverty rate among all races was 10.9 percent in 2010. This compared to the 4.8 percent black poverty rate of 2000 and the 6.6 percent Native American poverty rate of 1981-92.

For example, the Native American poverty rate at 7.2 percent in 2010 is still above the black poverty rate, 16.3 percent, that the Census Bureau calculated was the national poverty rate in 2012. The Native American unemployment is also quite high. The Census Bureau has also been keeping track of the Native American youth unemployment rate, and it will reach 10.9 percent in 2017 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. One might be asked why the poor and poor in our country can't get help or services from the government. We are the only advanced and industrialized nation in the world without a Medicare insurance program. We pay so much more in taxes and receive so little in other help than to look after our own. But we cannot afford to lose any more of the resources needed for the poor and poor in our country to be able to help each other out with education. How can we make our communities and our families better off? That question that I will try to address here is not unique to New Mexico. When the federal government takes money from the states, the federal government does not give it to the states and the states use the money to spend it on all things and none of them are included in their spending plans or priorities.

I realize that some people are going to object or dismiss the economic statistics showing these trends. I can understand people not wanting to hear about this. This is the reason why I am presenting this topic here to provide a perspective that some members of this population, some of the Native people in this country or any of us want to hear more about. I hope that someone may have some real interest in hearing this so they can make their voice heard in their communities and around the nation. This is a topic for all of us to share with one another, but in recent weeks the issue of our community that seems to be ignored here in",1
" This Poll Shows EXACTLY How Much Americans Detest Trump At this point in Trump s disastrous presidency, it s pretty clear that the only one that thinks he s doing a great job is the underserving POTUS himself. Even his own supporters have lost faith in him and are turning away at record speed. Despite his rapidly plummeting approval  rating, the president still managed to push his approval rating toward record lows in January and February alone. In the month of February, his disapproval rating dipped over eight points to 31%.

His supporters and the media still expect that the president is going to do a fabulous job. For them, this latest poll finds Trump lagging somewhat below ""normal.""

But, how good, how bad, when does Trump finally pull ahead? The president is still far from being a natural leader who is going to execute at the highest level. His supporters may be correct in expecting that Trump is going to fail miserably and be replaced as head of the most incompetent administration in history.

Just how do you replace Trump?

The answer is simple: It s going to depend on the individual. If the president s going to go down, and his support is in decline and his party is struggling, it s going to be quite tricky to replace the president.

Trump has a large group of loyalists with whom he has worked for 30 minutes. That group wants Trump to remain strong and keep up support. They trust him more to be effective with the job and is willing to help him out in times of adversity.

On the other hand, many in the base that is frustrated might vote for somebody like Bernie Sanders but that s not enough to elect their own nominee for president with a major primary challenge.

That s going to help determine how far Trump can push this year. As it s easy for people to believe the media and the president s administration knows the president is the problem, this poll only shows how tough he s going to continue to be until voters make up his mind.<|endoftext|>The New Hampshire Democratic Party announced three days ago that, according to a New Hampshire primary voter ID law, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would ""go home without a victory"" in November should she win the state in November.

"Unhinged NBA Coach: ‘White People Especially’ Need To Be Made ‘Uncomfortable’ [Video] San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is a total ass. There is no other way to say it! This jackwagon claimed on ESPN2 s The Paul Finebaum Show Monday that people have to be made to feel uncomfortable, specifically singling out white people. It s no secret that he doesn  sicces the Spurs on non-white fans, especially his own. But that was not his focus when he was asked on Tuesday if non-white fans should be treated differently than white people were treated.

To recap:

""When I talk to these Asian fans that I've met,"" Popovich said, "" I ask, 'When did you come to the Spurs?' and I'll answer that question for them all.""

I know why this is insulting, because it is an insult to his own white friends.

It has occurred to me at some point in time over the years that all those times when I would tell this guy, ""Listen, white guys come to Spurs games. This team won't be good without you in the starting lineup,"" he'd say, ""You know, it s really sad that there is some group of black people whose race doesn't matter when all else is equal.""

I s not saying any of that. I'm not saying that, and even if I do say it, it is being incredibly dismissive. This is a man who came out and said that the San Antonio Spurs deserve to win a title and had this conversation:

""I'll tell you what; when I say things like this, I'm just being brutally honest with you, and if you don't accept that, then you're a racist. And, if I was a racist, I would go after the people who run the league. And if that's what it takes, I'm not looking.""

If people say things like this and you tell me that you do want them to win a title, you are a racist. But it s not a racist statement.

I am using my white friends in this conversation to illustrate his point. I am using them as a way to highlight how non-white members of this community have to be made to feel uncomfortable and that they need to be helped. A racist is treating white people differently than they are treated. I don s understand why white people feel differently over an issue like this, as though this issue s a choice that only black people have to give birth to, especially the Black Lives Matter (BLM) group, that says that Black people are treated differently than white people. If I am being very specific, I am asking white people s to not be racist.

The entire point of the comments was that we have to teach non-whites, particularly non-black people, not to take their concerns",1
"HILLARY WILL LAND IN PRISON, NOT THE OVAL OFFICE HILLARY WILL LAND IN PRISON, NOT THE OVAL OFFICE Posted on Tweet Home » Headlines » World News » HILLARY WILL LAND IN PRISON, NOT THE OVAL OFFICE FBI Director James Comey has caved to the pressure of his outraged employees at the FBI, and re-opened the CRIMINAL investigation of  Hillary Rodham Clinton by letting Huma Abedin keep her job.


The FBI director announced Thursday that he was re-opening criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton for her e-mail server while Clinton led the State Department. ""This is a decision that I reached on a case-by-case basis based on new information and information that does not directly involve former Secretary Clinton,"" she said. Abedin, who was Clinton's deputy chief of staff when she handled classified information during her time as secretary of state, is likely to go. She will be paid $455,000 when she retires, but will receive at least $120,000 during her employment as a senior official. ""Abedin is now the highest-ranking public official to receive immunity from prosecution under either the executive privilege or whistleblower statutes since 1998,"" FBI director James Comey said. Comey said at a press conference that, because Clinton wasn't in direct communication with the secretary about e-mails or server usage at the time she set up the server as secretary of state, it was not appropriate to ask whether she was given guidance to keep her e-mails strictly personal and to use a personal email account, a practice that violated federal record-keeping laws. Comey said he re-opened the case because new information uncovered by FBI investigators ""made it clear that Secretary Clinton should have known"" that she was potentially subject to criminal prosecution when she used the private server. As part of a criminal investigation, the Justice Department needs public assistance to interview witnesses to try to figure out whether individuals have committed crimes. For one person, that person needs immunity from prosecution. And because Abedin was not a part of the original investigation in which it was determined that classified information was ""incidental,"" Comey said, her continued employment at the State Department would jeopardize that review. Abedin has previously testified in front of Congress that she was pressured by lawyers at the State Department about providing sensitive e-mails for her husband to use on official government accounts. If true, this means Clinton's attorneys probably had Clinton in charge of classified email security when she moved e-mail accounts on an off-the-books basis. They could have done her client a favor by leaving a copy of the e-mails in the State Department. But Abedin's job was not on the line.


The new information uncovered by the FBI does not directly involved Clinton. So there are no potential criminal penalties at stake. But the FBI's investigation ""makes it clear that Secretary Clinton should have known"" she was potentially subject to criminal prosecution when she used",1
"HERE ARE THE FIVE State Department Rules That Hillary Violated [Video] While Hillary doubles down on her false claim that the rules were clarified AFTER she left the State Department, we ve got the 5 top rules she broke. But first we need to listen to the masterful liar herself:Hillary Clinton doubles down on defending her email practices: Rules were not  clarified... yet Hillary doubled down on her false claim the rules were not clarified because she had left out the fact that the rules were not clarified... yet. And in fact, it has never been clarified. And now that it has been clarified, we are going to take a look at the most outrageous parts of her statements.For the record... in her infamous January 14, 2015 speech to Wall Street executives, Hillary Clinton repeated her claim that the emails were ""secured"" by the State Department even though she said this to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Clinton's claims:1) No email is ""secured."" ""The State Department does not have any records of private emails exchanged by former Secretaries of State, including Hillary Clinton.""2) No email is ""secured."" And why would a former Secretary of State send them through the normal process so they would eventually escape the chain of custody that a law enforcement agency uses when investigating national security threats or terrorist activities. She said nothing about emails being ""secured,"" so she doesn't have them.3) No emails are ""secured."" And the fact that she says she sent 1,000 in 2014 without realizing she was taking care of business. And if she had known about all the other ones sent through security at the State Department, she would have known that there must have been other ones sent by others.4) No emails are ""secured."" Not even a personal email account with a ""secure"" attachment file is considered secure by State, so it doesn't matter if she sent her messages through other systems like Gmail and Yahoo accounts, as long as they get there, they get there.5) No emails are ""secured."" She claims that there is ""no email in government record that mentions Mrs. Clinton, her email account, or anything related to the private server she used while Secretary of State. All those emails were either turned over or destroyed.""Clinton's claim is ludicrous, as emails between and among top government officials are not secret... even though Secretary Clinton used a nonsecure email network while serving as Secretary of State.Clinton went further to accuse the State Department of ""wiping"" her emails. She said the ""evidence shows she wiped the server all over again."" That seems almost like a blatant lie because all those emails are already destroyed and any information that is not destroyed should go out to the public and be reviewed.Clinton also claimed that the emails were ""personal"" and that any government records should be treated by the State Department as personal because",1

Feds Search 'Novel' Gmail In San Francisco (PHOTOS) The FBI and the USPS, led by the Drug Enforcement Administration, want to search what they believe to be a highly advanced version of Gmail, based on evidence they found in the San Francisco home where FBI agent Mark Fusco lives.

A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who said he saw the warrant during a public hearing of the FBI Civil Asset Forfeiture Authority on Wednesday told Reuters on Friday that it had been approved.

The warrant allows the authorities to inspect computer systems, including ""the Gmail servers, without an attorney's knowledge or approval,"" according to an agency release.

The US Postal Service, a division of United States Mail Corp, was hired to manage a massive federal website in 2004. It was funded by a $300 million US Department of Commerce loan and by donations and support from an unspecified ""third party.""

The government was seeking to seize millions of dollars in funds from mailboxes and related assets on the website by June 5 to cover a $1.6 million bill for postage from 2006 to 2012. That bill had been paid, but money has not surfaced yet.

The FBI issued an alert in August that it may ""expose and utilize a potential federal criminal violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030, if its agents are able to find the material.""

In an emailed statement, Fusco said the agency sent a request in June for data on about 8,000 emails in question from employees at The Associated Press, which had hired The Gourmet G",1
"Homeschooling and Other Education Alternatives on the Rise Email Horace Mann, the first secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education, speaking a few years before the Civil War, declared that public schools constituted “the greatest discovery ever made by man."" He added, ""Let the common [public) school be expanded to its capabilities, let it be worked with the  greatest efficiency and precision … the state now has as numerous methods to develop the genius of men as are those of nature."" As early as 1821, the Massachusetts legislature debated creating a school for the retarded.

When the board passed a bill giving the state's four districts the authority to pay tuition, the idea was enthusiastically embraced by Republican presidential nominee Franklin Roosevelt and former New Hampshire Gov. James Monroe as the greatest education reform in world history. By 1913 more than 1.7 million residents were enrolled in high school—almost twice the number who enrolled in middle school. This was the largest number of citizens attending education in a single year ever registered by the U.S. The same year Roosevelt won the presidential election he appointed Horace R. Mann to establish a $10 million trust fund for the purpose of providing higher education, with its own fund for education to children from poor families. At first, the trust fund was used primarily to pay for education for New Englanders with limited income but in 1933 the funds were given to students in other states. By 1949, the trust fund was distributed to all schools throughout the state.

The creation of a statewide public education system became a matter of federal education policy in 1954, when President Eisenhower, acting on the advice of the United States Council on Education, placed the First Amendment and the federal Educational Welfare Act in the national constitutional framework. The first act of Congress providing a separate federal education program, the Civil Rights Act, made special provision to ensure that children of disadvantaged families received access to a higher education. In this action the Constitution was invoked to provide for an ""equal playing field in public education"": to provide equal conditions to all children in order to meet their educational needs.

However, only a few years ago the first national studies on the performance of young people who were given an education in the state system showed that these youths did not excel in reading nor mathematics at the high school level. Only one in 25 high school students met each of the state test of academic abilities, and in only one in 12 schools did a student take the state's National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) national exam in reading and writing. As a result, these students received lower scores on average on standardized math and reading tests across the state.

"BREAKING: COURAGEOUS FEDERAL JUDGE DENIES OBAMA’S REQUEST TO LIFT STAY ON EXECUTIVE AMNESTY If I were U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, I d be keeping these guys close by:The injunction that has blocked President Barack Obama s executive amnesty will remain in place following the ruling of a federal judge Tuesday night in this Texas border city.In a late night ruling, U.S. District  Judge Andrew Hanen ordered Judge Steven Tash in San Antonio to stay the injunction so that they could begin filing motions for a new one that will block implementation of Mr. Obama s illegal order.Hanen concluded that the injunction will be effective July 11 because it was issued on a specific date.""While the District Court ruling in this case is without legal precedent, the District judge has no authority to impose new, unconstitutional conditions on the status of lawful permanent residents and others unlawfully detained at U.S. border points,"" he wrote. The district court held that Mr. Obama s illegal order was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.""The District Court did not engage in judicial estoppel, but it did not ignore the Constitution's protections for people who are seeking legal entry to the United States,"" Mr. Hanen wrote Tuesday night. ""Thus, the district court may not exercise its discretion in applying the 'ex parte' doctrine to the president's immigration amnesty.""Mr. Obama said Tuesday evening, speaking from Mexico, that the president was thrilled with the ruling, saying, ""This is a victory for the rule of law and America's ability to ensure that our borders and the rule of law are enforced.""The president has been urging Texas to get on board with a new border wall plan as part of the president s immigration agenda.""We will do everything we can to help these folks be able to pursue justice and find relief, including expediting the issuance of their visas as quickly as possible so that their families can become lawful residents,"" Mr. Obama said.The U.S. attorney office for the northern district of Texas said in a statement it planned to ask a US district court in Texas to allow a new, temporary injunction preventing the president from issuing the executive order to the government.The decision was a surprise to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which issued an immediate notice to Congress calling on lawmakers to pass a bill protecting illegal immigrants from deportation, as it could help keep U.S. border agents and agents enforcing immigration enforcement from interfering with the executive order.""ICE is deeply disappointed by today's ruling by U.S. District Judge Aleta L. Alsup, who had sought to hold President Obama's executive amnesty and other executive actions to be within its discretion. The executive order itself is consistent with the Court 's previous rulings and reflects Congress's intent to grant appropriate relief to unauthorized immigrants in a manner that allows for their peaceful pursuit of self-fulfilment,""ICE spokesman David Lapan said.

"Woodward On Clinton Foundation “It’s Corrupt” Abby Martin Exposes What Hillary Clinton Really Represents ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Woodward On Clinton Foundation “It’s Corrupt” By VNN on October  27, 2016 4:18 pm

On Monday, April 24, 2017, Hillary Clinton, as Vice President, received a $15 million gift from the Clintons Foundation; the first Presidential gift of any type since Bill and Hillary Clinton formally stepped down in 2001. The Clinton Foundation is headquartered at the same Washington D.C. apartment building as a family office, with the same security, control and auditing and is overseen by an under-secretary for management and financial management named, ""Bill,"" who is paid $200,000 annually plus $140,000 in speaking fees by the Clinton Foundation. In return, the Clintons receive lucrative fees from various organizations, including the Ford Foundation and other foundation affiliates for speeches, speaking engagements and other events. The Ford Foundation receives approximately $35 million annually from the Clinton Foundation. Many of the speaking engagements and conferences offered by the Clintons benefit the Ford Foundation or Bill and Hillary Clinton directly and/or indirectly. The ""Bill"" who has the responsibility for running the Clinton Foundation is also the Secretary of State. At Clinton's request, the President of the State Department, Hillary Clinton, is also chairing the State Department, the office of the Presidency and the secretary of Commerce in the Clinton-led government. During the Presidential transition, Clinton's State Department granted the Clinton Foundation approximately $35 million annually. This amount represents $13% of Clinton's total discretionary spending during the 2016 presidential campaign cycle. This figure amounts to $15 million per year from Clinton with the President of the United States taking away $11 million with the State Department.

Hillary Clinton: The Unofficial 'Puppet' of the Clintons ′By VNN on October 27, 2016 4:06 pm

As president of the United States, Hillary Clinton has given $2.4 million in speaking fees to foundation-linked groups, including the Ford Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. In total, the Foundation for the Advancement of Women and Girls has given Clinton money representing $15 million to $20 million, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Other speaking fees to the Foundation amounting to as little as $2,200 were paid by the Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Global Initiative – which, it must be noted, receives from Hillary Clinton millions in government funds, as we reported previously.

There are going to be many more pieces added into the Vikings draft in the coming weeks, with a total of nine first-rounders. There is one player off the table that may not actually be on the board at the moment. The former UCLA linebacker and free agent linebacker Jadar Johnson is expected to go to the Philadelphia Eagles, a person with knowledge of the situation told NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport.

While the Rams, Seahawks and Chiefs are considered frontrunners for Johnson and will probably add him at some slot cornerback, there's likely more to come from teams who just haven't made a move in free agency. The 49ers recently signed former Bears safety Will Hill to fill one of two holes at safety they've identified; the other is at corner. The Rams also reportedly want to get something in return to take on the $5 million cap hit it will cost to cut Johnson in the first week of free agency, a league source said.

Johnson, 25, played in only six games for the Bears in 2011 and was released after the season. He began 2017 with a broken hand, leading the Bears to re-sign the linebacker at the salary-cap figure of $1.6 million. The Seahawks are reportedly interested in giving him a big price tag and the",1
" WATCH: Fox News Host Calls President Obama Weak For Not Declaring War On ISIS Last time I checked, the Constitution still says declaring war is Congress job.As a former lawyer and judge, one would think Jeanine Pirro would know what the Constitution says, but during an appearance on Fox & Friends on Friday morning, she demonstrated why she should never have been allowed to  rule out the possibility that the Constitution is a sham.Here, Jeanine stated:In other words, Pirro was wrong to tell the 9/11 Truth Movement that if Congress declares a war, it's Congress' job to declare war. If the Constitution says the President must ""bomb"" terrorist attacks, then that's Congress' job to declare a war. But if the Constitution declares that any action takes place on the ground of war, then that is the war's job: Congress' job to declare war.This is what Pirro meant and her explanation is that the 9/11 Truth Movement doesn't seem to care about the Constitution, and that people like her, who should know better, don't pay much attention to what we say.This was in a Fox News debate, so it may not be entirely accurate. Pirro may not be a federal court judge, but she is a regular contributor to Fox News at this time, having contributed in the past to her own program.Jeanine Pirro is not above the law, despite her ignorance regarding the Constitution. As one would expect, she made no apologies for her ignorance.As mentioned, it would be hard for many, including myself, if the court decided today that Jeanine Pirro's explanation is accurate, as the Constitution clearly and completely forbids the president from seeking Congressional approval prior to engaging in war. In an effort to save their minds from being filled with nonsense, they could consider the following:It's not clear whether the court would choose to recognize Jeanine Pirro's incorrect reasoning or to dismiss her argument, but one thing's for certain: she'll never be allowed to go to work for Congress or the judiciary again.<|endoftext|>A federal judge in Texas sentenced a Houston man Thursday to five years in prison on charges related to his illegal manufacture of crack cocaine.

" Fox Host Goes After ‘Soulless’ Hillary Clinton, Chelsea’s Response Is PRICELESS (TWEET) Now that Donald Trump s Russia scandal has been blown wide open and more incriminating evidence is surfacing by the day, Fox News is more desperate than ever to find ways to save Trump s reputation. Last night, the untrustworthy conservative network delivered a low blow to Trump s 2016  Whitehouse campaign:

Fox & Friends is now urging viewers to send out an email blast to Fox News readers, claiming that the campaign paid the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, one of whom was the source of the Russia-Clinton dossier.

But the email was actually sent by former GOP presidential candidate Mike Pence, who also claims in a New York Times interview that James B. Comey, the former FBI director, lied to him when he said, ""I'm not under investigation"" last month in response to a Justice Department letter to Congress.

Fox & Friends host Tucker Carlson's explanation for the email blast: ""It was a message to readers from Mike Pence and not a directive from [Sean] Spicer."" But it looks like Fox knows it can never be a direct message from the Trump campaign to its own voters. And in a moment of pure politics, its editors got their email into the White House hands and sent it to their viewers.

It all adds up to a Trump campaign that was so desperate (that's a phrase, right?) to save its image that the FBI reportedly offered an advance $7 million on the price of rebranding the Donald J. Trump campaign. It remains to be seen what Trump will do regarding Roger Stone, who is widely believed to be the source of the Russian dossier, though his actions and subsequent statements are not exactly helping the White House's image.<|endoftext|>The American Civil Liberties Union filed a $100 million lawsuit Tuesday seeking class action status for a group of people arrested for making a motionless chicken pox.

""Plaintiffs were charged and convicted of violating a provision in Section 1021 of Title 18 of the United States Code that prohibits public officials from taking steps or encouraging a person to violate a court order prohibiting the entry of certain persons upon the streets, public squares, or lands of another state,"" the ACLU states. ""This suit challenges Defendants' continued practice of arresting individuals who may have no ties to these laws on the basis of 'motionless chicken pox.'""

The plaintiffs say the law prohibits anyone from being stopped or arrested for a ""mere motion-or-advance"" offense that does not cause another person to feel scared or anxious, and is a misdemeanor as opposed to a felony.

"The Bolton Threat to Trump’s Middle East Policy Written by Gareth Porter Post-election comments on Middle East policy last week by President-elect Donald Trump and one his campaign advisers have provoked speculation about whether Trump will upend two main foreign policy lines of the Obama administration in the Middle East.But the more decisive question about the future of  the Obama-era counterterrorism policy may lie just within the American administration itself, and within the White House itself.""It is time that the White House stops the failed policies and start doing something about the real world threats that exist,"" retired Marine General John Allen, former director of Central Command, said at the White House. He is now professor emeritus of political science at Georgetown University and a visiting fellow at Harvard University, where he advised President Obama.The Pentagon has begun to implement a long-promised policy package, which calls for a surge of up to 500,000 US ground troops in Iraq, Syria and Libya, a role that has drawn criticism because it could encourage sectarian, ethnic and political tensions in the regions. The Pentagon policy paper ""ISIS: An Alternative Geopolitics"" states the president's plan is to build up an effective Iraqi political and security force that will be well-armed, trained, equipped and integrated into the Iraqi state ""from the start"" and that will help the Iraqis ""resist any threat to their democracy or their sovereignty, from the Sunni to the Shiite, from Iran to ISIS.""Allen and others have said ""ISIS: An Alternative Geopolitics"" does not require US ground troops, although the proposal would give the Pentagon wider authorities to conduct ""regional operations. This will facilitate a transition as we seek an end to ISIL,"" Allen told reporters after talks with Trump in the Oval Office last week. The US, the senior general added, would be prepared to fight alongside Iraq's Kurdish regional government.Allen also said President Barack Obama's policy of ""regional command and control"" for US forces has been counterproductive and ""will be challenged soon."" In 2010, he wrote in a memo to the president, Obama told him to give special emphasis to taking the war effort to Syria, saying ""We are committed to bringing down Bashar al-Assad's regime, and in particular his proxy forces in Syria,"" Allen said. ""We are not done. We are committed to trying to bring down his regime and to establishing some sort of transitional government in Syria.""Allen's opinion appears to be shared by other officials and pundits on the subject.

If you do that, the Syrian people will not have to wait 50 years, 50 years, a little bit longer until they can see their future,"" Hillary Clinton said last week.Trump has vowed to create a Middle East ""greater and stronger"" than what President George W.

German newspaper Bild reported that migrants held in refugee centers have received food and water during recent weeks but have been denied access to medical attention or even a taxi.


""It's like hell,"" local resident Svante Knauf told the paper. His story follows another in July 2016, when asylum seekers in Germany found a room they had rented in a refugee center and were denied any help or medical care.


In February, a German court ruled that it would be unlawful to forcibly remove anyone from their temporary housing centers without providing access to legal advice or compensation. One court official told German broadcaster ORF that ""if the person wants to leave, they must leave.""


Many of the displaced said in early March that they were being treated poorly and subjected to ""scumbags walking around,"" although authorities say they are investigating numerous complaints.

The German government announced Wednesday that it would ban the distribution of the Syrian passport on April 18 due to the increasing popularity of Islamic State fighters fighting in Syria and Iraq.

The report, based on international crime and police data and a database maintained by police in Malaysia, finds the number of reports of crime against young Malaysians was rising around 2001 after the 2002 general election, rising from 1,034 in 2001-2003 to 3,097 from 2004 to 2005 to 9,633 in 2006.

""During the time from 2000 to 2004, crime in the richest nations was increasing by around 2 and a half percent per day,"" said Dr Prasath Anwar, head of research institute on crime at the University of the West of England.

Anwar said it was hard to predict how crime would be affected if the population increased.

""So far this report shows that for example if the population increases then that's a bigger source of crime than if it remains the same. And with this increase in income there was a greater threat to public order,"" Anwar said.

""The study also shows that the decrease of crime by the rich countries would affect",1
" Clinton Is Beating Trump By 9 Points In Pennsylvania – Here’s Why That Matters It s a good thing Democrats picked Philadelphia to host their convention. Pennsylvania is continually being talked up as swing state that could go for Trump (they said the same thing about Romney in 2012, and he lost by 5 percent).But as Hillary Clinton delivered her acceptance speech, one that  was so long, so heavy on rhetoric, and so obviously a reflection of her defeat, there was one area the delegates should have focused attention on: Trump's tax returns.And there, we found one of the most compelling reasons to see the party's platform at the convention. We think that's because of what these tax returns reveal about Donald Trump.On the campaign trail during the primary, Trump offered two very different versions of the policies he would pursue to deliver America a better economic future, both of which could be accomplished through taxing the very rich and ensuring we keep our entitlements and Medicaid at a minimum. But while his proposals were widely popular, neither version of the agenda achieved a majority in the Republican Party, leaving many voters to find something better.For the next 10 years, that's what this vote is about. This convention will determine if this party can continue making that call of electing a president who is truly independent and the first among allies to step down.

Watch more! See, on Tuesday's 'Meet the Press,' Obama said he believes Donald Trump's comments that he may not release some tax returns because they reveal his ""tax returns have nothing to do with me,"" and Hillary Clinton said Obama made an ""obvious mistake"" on his comment about a candidate's tax returns.

After nearly four decades of working in public service, one man has been hired as director for the Democratic National Committee. Before taking that executive executive role in the early 1990s, Mike McCurry worked for Obama. He had left Washington in 2008 to run the Obama Victory Fund, a political action committee focused on election-related topics, and helped launch Obama's presidential ambitions four years earlier.

McCurry's new role involves planning and directing the operation the DNC will use in the fall in its bid for the White House. For an RNC official familiar with McCurry's work, the timing felt right, given the president's decision on Tuesday to release his tax returns, a decision expected to be made during the final week before the election. ""I've not spoken to Mike personally but we're talking at the White House, as well as working with the White House to ensure this is well understood as the election near",1
"“GUATEMALAN” MAN DIES After Falling Into WASTE GRINDER At Meat Plant…Former Worker Claims They Hire “90% Illegal Aliens”…Including “10-12 Yr Old Kids” This story is absolutely horrific, but not surprising. Bleeding heart liberals aren t doing illegal aliens any favors by fighting for them to come here, only to be abused by their employers, who hire them, and then hold their illegal immigration status over their heads when they demand safer working  conditions so as to get a free ride and a better life outside of law.

All too often, these liberals are in favor of what has been known as amnesty, which includes the legalization of undocumented immigrants. At this point in history, it's fair to say that President Obama's promise to secure the borders has been met with little more than utter disregard.

So, in light of the recent mass illegal alien crime perpetrated by the so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" it might actually go a considerable way toward answering this disturbing piece of news.

Of course, this whole situation is a very long time in the making.

Back in February, the Los Angeles Times broke a story that has been very well covered — with much interest outside the liberal establishment, even in liberal-leaning New York.

Los Angeles police are investigating the disappearance of a woman named Lala Elroy who disappeared in July 2010. Elroy had a white car stolen in California, and authorities believe she may have been killed. Elroy's car was recovered at the edge of Lake Tahoe in late August, but her body has not been found. Her parents, Richard Elroy and his wife and children, are believed to now be in Texas, where they claim Lala was killed.

""My wife got pulled over for driving slowly in my driveway, where one of my two children was born. The officer told me she was driving while her boyfriend and two of their friends were there, and she passed two officers,"" said Elroy's father, Richard.

Elroy was on her way to her job as a security guard and an account from her employer said that she had come from California and had been working in Silicon Valley, California. That account was, however, disputed when she got on the phone with the L.A. Times. Laila told her employer that two people were watching her and that she needed to come away from work in about an hour or two. That account was confirmed by the company itself.

The Los Angeles Times piece also contained an interesting account of Lala's death, and it's likely it's accurate. Lala worked at a popular Silicon Valley restaurant, and she didn't report working part time. Laila was said to have gone to pick up her daughter, who was a member of Code for America, a liberal tech organization dedicated to encouraging immigrants to work hard in order to stay here legally.

"Barack Obama’s Final Arms-Export Totals Doubles That of Bush Administration 21st Century Wire says 21WIRE has always pointed out that the marketing facade of Barack Obama as the Nobel Peace Prize President is just that a facade. The facts simply do not support the myth. Defense OneThe Obama administration has approved more than $278 billion in foreign arms sales in  eight years to Saudi Arabia, the nation led by Obama's bitter enemy Saudi King Salman.

But the White House's own Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Peter Cook told reporters Obama had no intention of reducing the Pentagon's budget to reflect the cost of America's military presence in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere.

The Obama administration announced last week that Obama's budget plan includes an unprecedented spending increase of $52 billion on arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The President has proposed reducing Pentagon spending by 23 percent on defense, and has set a target to cut defense spending by 28 percent.

The $52 billion increase in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia comes in addition to $25 billion to $28 billion to be invested in F-18 fighters that will be acquired from United Kingdom-based Lockheed Martin, a U.S. company in the commercial-industrial space.

The Saudis, a nation that has long pursued a close ally against the Islamic State and other radical Islamic organizations, will receive a $3 billion boost in U.S. fighter jets to join three already operating fighter aircraft in the region and the deployment of five more in the last 12 months. The U.S. was also selected to buy $200 million worth of training and logistics support for Saudi special forces.

President Obama's Saudi arms sales to Saudi Arabia include the sale of six Apache attack helicopters; 24 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, a fighter air-to-air hybrid aircraft that replaces the F-14 Tomcat; two F/A-18 Hornets with Joint Direct Attack Munitions; and two Apache attack helicopters, six AH-64E Apache patrol aircraft, and other weapons.

But the weapons sold to Saudi Arabia do not include U.S. military support for the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies based overseas in places like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Rather, the arms deal contains contracts for U.S. weapons and training used for training American local police forces, not the U.S. military or its allies in the Gulf.

Cook told reporters last week that the $52 billion increase in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia is in addition to $5 billion to $10 billion to be invested in F-18 fighters that will be acquired from United Kingdom-based Lockheed Martin, a U.S. company in the commercial-industrial space.

In a plea to federal prosecutors, Michael Stover pleaded guilty to murder in the first-degree and attempted murder in the second, and will spend the rest of his 20-year sentence behind bars.

Federal prosecutors are demanding $2 million from Stover as part of a separate plea deal. A source with knowledge of the plea deal told the New York Daily News that Stover would be released within 48 hours, but he will be placed under the complete control of federal authorities, the paper reported.

The FBI arrested Stover in the spring of 2013 on the suspicion of killing 29-year-old Jessica Ghawi in her Washington state house after the relationship began. At the time, authorities had little evidence to go on, and little knowledge of the case because there had been no police-involved deaths of women in the area in over three years.

Gawanesh Gautam, a public relations consultant to the FBI, had lived with Stover at his D.C. rental house and reported that she was not in danger. She told police that his mother had been abusive to him in the past and claimed Stover was a friend of hers, the Daily News reported.

" Obama Just OBLITERATED The GOP’s Threat To Kill The Supreme Court If Hillary Wins This election is all about the Supreme Court, and nobody s been hammering that point more than Republicans. They say that if Hillary s elected, she ll nominate liberal judges who will take away all our rights and freedoms, or something, because that s totally how the judicial branch works.  How can that work? And so when they lose the election, they will be saying, ""Well, yeah, we won the election but we got so screwed after the Supreme Court."" The only way to really make America great again is to replace the Supreme Court with something more representative of the American people. Now, that s not a partisan issue, but I am absolutely convinced that the Republican Party and the people are already doing what we did, and they want to do this. They have been putting their money where their mouth is, so it will be hard to make a change.

BASH: I want to move on. Senator McCain, your son received the Purple Heart. He lost his right leg in the war in Afghanistan, and he is still battling the wound in his left leg. So you just asked, do you think that your son got the Purple Heart?

CHRISTIE: I think, first of all, that I would prefer not to speak about it. You know, when I was a young man, I used to give speeches and have a lot of people say, you know, it shouldn't happen. ""It's not right in my honor. I know, you know, there's been things like this going on in the past. But I don't think it really bothers me, because the fact is I had a leg blown off by a shot to the head, it looked like I was going to die. And at 30, a guy like that, he's got a career that's been on the line for 40 years. He comes back from a war zone, and has a pretty tough time. But he gets that Purple Heart, and it makes me feel great. That s why, you know, I know my son is pretty much right about something. I have more respect for him than others have for me. You know, people say stuff now and then, but that s how long my father has been here. I think he got the greatest of them all. I am sure that when America gets to a place where we can afford to pay our veterans a little more, my son will be proud, and that s the way we want it to be done.

On July 27, 2013, Power to the Future (PGTF), the largest energy company in America (and the nation's largest public utilities, as they are known), is announcing plans to launch a new program called Energy Incentives for Energy Efficiency by 2015. As with any significant policy move, there are challenges. The goals are lofty while the implementation of the program may not be immediate. PGTF does not have to build or operate any new facilities. But many of its competitors have already built some. Here are some potential costs of the plan.

Projects, projects, projects

Currently, a number of projects are underway to cut power as well as increase efficiency or reduce emissions at power plants. PGTF's initiative could also help others (the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that ""about 40% of power plants in 20 U.S. states [have] installed technologies that reduce or eliminate their electricity use for energy efficiency purposes,"" with over 4,000 plants, such as solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, and tidal power units), although much more may be done. PGTF also has plans for other efficiency gains, such as making energy-efficient appliances, furnaces, and heating and cooling systems",1
" Chelsea Handler Has Hilarious Proposition For Donald Trump And His ‘Large Hands’ (TWEET) If there s one person in this world that clearly gives no f*cks about what people think of them, it s Chelsea Handler. Her no-nonsense humor is not only hilarious, but often times brutally honest. She ll say what most people are thinking, but just don t have the courage  to act on it. And this goes for her many books and videos, a vast collection which spans topics from sex ed to cooking to parenting. She takes the time to talk with you directly about the things you think without having to resort to being patronizing and condescending. She s often funny, just never mean-spirited. And she knows exactly what she wants us to feel.

If you s seen Chelsea at a karaoke or an art show, chances are she's about to get some laughs. If you heard she s a contestant on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, chances are youve seen her perform for millions. Chelsea s most famous work was her new memoir. It s a hilarious and touching memoir in it s words of candour s in the wake of being sexually abused. The book also contains stories of trauma and how it is still hard for kids to learn how to deal with it. All the images of Chelsea s life in it show her to be a genuine person; funny, beautiful, and brave.

Chelsea also started the Women s Workbook s organization to empower women s to be more vocal, better informed about their issues and work together s to fight workplace discrimination. Chelsea is the founder of her own children s foundation and has a new book coming out as well. Now that this organization is launching women s workbook s organization s she s also giving away a new Chelsea Handler s memoir, Sex Tape in the Mail , to help empower women s to talk openly about having an affair, or sex s with male partner s and the harm it causes.

If the above s just s you, then I s not your girl. You s should not look upon Chelsea as your one hero who s is fighting for equality. Chelsea s story is full of injustice. Her story s of being sexually abused, and then having it all turned on it head on; of losing her career and having it get all personal, and having no help from anyone s save her family. Chelsea s story was all-the-more powerful when she s got the support and support s of people s of different shapes of society and s background. Chelsea s story s were just plain awesome s which are what make her s book so special.

Just because she s so positive doesn s mean he s your girl in any way. You s might not like her story s of sex s with guy s, you s might not be ready to have sex s with your own boyfriend s. And it s hard for you",1
"ELECTION WHISTLEBLOWER: DOJ In Cahoots With Dems…4 Million Dead On Voter Rolls…Trump Is Right! [Video] J. Christian Adams: Dead people are voting and it s something this administration does not want to do anything about. They must like it. They must like who they are voting for Now we have four million, four million Steve, ineligible and dead voters on American voter rolls according to  the Department of Justice. Now we are moving in a direction where what they do is they will try to prevent people from voting because they cannot account for their life histories — what they did with their family. It s like their mother. It s not right, it s not acceptable. He says it s not OK. And he s got to fix it, and there s really something wrong with this.

MARTIN: Do you think that this is related to the voter ID law?

MIDASCHUL: It s going to affect voting turnout. It may also affect the turnout of Republican voters who will not be able to vote, those who will vote for Hillary Clinton, and they are going to be affected. And so - and one of the things that the - that we should keep in mind here is that this is a bill - this is about a bill that was passed last year and passed by the House of Representatives, by the Senate, and was voted upon by the Senate and also overwhelmingly enacted by the Congress.

Now this is not about Republicans wanting to cut off their opponents from political participation. Because a lot of what we are talking about, the one thing we have to keep in mind is the one thing that Republicans - they are trying to do is try to cut off the - they are trying to cut off any chance that they - Democrats have to have any political access. As our listeners might know, the election is coming up next fall. I mean this legislation has been coming out for some time; it has not gotten a chance to become law. It has now passed by the House, by the Senate, overwhelmingly, and by the Congress. And the point is that this Republican is trying to block any possibility for any kind of legislative accountability to hold people accountable. The bill that this Republican is trying to cut off, is a bill that they would put in place of this. I mean, if you have a democracy, that is a bill that the elected authorities would pass to give people greater accountability if they were to vote and to hold people accountable if they had not voted.

MARTIN: In addition to this issue, there has been other aspects to this bill in the states. Some of these states in the South are looking at these laws as anti-democratic. Some say that if they are passed they will actually become less democratic. Are you worried about the idea that these state legislatures will take this as a lead to more legislative elections?

"UPDATE ON 9/11 MEMORIAL Banned for “Triggering” College Snowflakes Great news! Southern Methodist University in Texas has reversed its decision to relocate an annual 9/11 memorial display made up of nearly 3,000 American flags to a less prominent part of campus after facing backlash from student groups.A huge thank you to The Young Americans for Freedom group! They had  been instrumental in securing funding for the display and, after getting complaints from students, they withdrew support for the installation.The Texas flag also appears in an earlier image in response to the controversy. It also appears in another online photo that was created after the controversy. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that photograph.In recent weeks, student groups protested the display because it was placed near the historic South Campus where the campus is located and because it would give police a platform to question students about their involvement in the demonstrations. The displays were already planned for several of the school's four outdoor classrooms.The South Campus is scheduled to be demolished and replaced by an office tower during Memorial Day Weekend.<|endoftext|>This is a project I've been working on for over a year now, the reason I am able to do this is, I've started to get more and more excited about what I can achieve with this app and my ideas on how to increase the game play options on my phone to allow players to have a greater experience of my games.

"EXPERT CLAIMS N. KOREA’S SECOND MISSILE Test Demonstrates They Now Have Ability To Hit 3 Major Cities On U.S. Mainland When asked if a pre-emptive military strike is a possibility, as reported last week by NBC News, Trump wouldn t elaborate. I don t want to telegraph what I m doing or what I m thinking. I m not like other administrations, where they say we re going to do  something about something, but we hav e only been talking about it for two weeks, haven t we?

So Trump did not say anything about what an executive order might look like. And as recently as Thursday, the White House press secretary reiterated that the president ""does have the power"" to carry out an attack and that there is ""an option to do something about it.""


""I don't want to let you down,"" he said, adding that as a candidate, he would not hesitate to strike.

Trump's remarks, made in the middle of his press briefing with reporters when he returned from Saudi Arabia, may suggest that the president has made preparations for such an attack. He also used this week's visit to talk about his plan for ""the most amazing border wall you never seen"" with Mexico to ""keep out criminals, bad dudes and drug dealers.""

But it may be that Trump himself is in the loop. One day after the press conference, Trump suggested that the president has ""more flexibility"" to carry out his executive order.

When pressed, he told NBC's Lester Holt that he was not going to be forced to use those powers. And the president also said that it was ""absolutely the case"" that he will decide how to handle things if they are ruled illegal.


""I can tell you that I am going to use it as I see fit. And I haven't talked yet about where I're going to start because I just haven't heard from the Department, but I will very quickly decide with respect to that at a later date,"" he said.

We must remember that Trump has a long history of saying things that he later backs off or changes. While he did say in 2011 -- while speaking of the Muslim ban -- that he would be ""looking hard"" for ways to ""make it legal"" for people born in the U.S. to carry a gun. He ultimately did decide not to back down.

We don t know what is in play, and whether Trump will actually use an executive order to carry out this plan -- and whether he will be forced by the courts.


But his public comments could open a new front in the dispute between the Obama administration and the nation's military and police officers. In his speech, Trump described ""extreme vetting"" of people entering the country, saying that ""we must stop the bad ones first, and then the good ones"" (emphasis mine).

Most people have no idea how much money the average billionaire (who can make anything by donating their money up front for the year and for his future wife) makes. Donald Trump is going to make things a lot worse for his fellow rich white men.We also have the fact that he is going to kill any of the programs that were created under President Obama that are trying to improve the lives of Americans like everyone else. People like to think of President Trump as pro gun and pro free market but if he follows through on the plans made by him to gut the social programs in his name then more and more of the US would see a violent revolution. That should be a wake up call for all Americans that Trump can and could be someone to fear.<|endoftext|>Greetings MechWarriors! We're excited to announce our new official website!

" Republican Insiders Are Taking Aim At Trump, Calling On Pence To Drop Out Now that it s been exposed that Donald Trump is a serial pervert who sexually assaults women, Republicans are desperate to get him out of the race and promptly replaced by another GOPer who, you know, doesn t casually admit to forcing himself onto women.Well it s harder said than  done, because the GOP has long had a fondness for saying bad things about everyone — even those they were supposed to be running with. Thats because once you're a target, you tend to want to be as bad as someone you hate. We're starting to see this trend in both the GOP and the primary campaigns, as evidenced by some of the more bizarre ""conclusions"" that have popped up. For instance, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is currently working on a smear campaign against Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) just so they have more money. The group has been using her past support for student debt interest relief to paint her as hypocritical. Or how about how, under Republican presidential nominee Ted Cruz, the GOP turned its attention away from defunding the Department of Education , and focused instead on defunding Planned Parenthood , instead of focusing on tax reform ? Oh, yeah, and it s hard to tell if it s just coincidence: The anti-abortion group Americans United even released an ad that says women who get abortions go to Planned Parenthood so they can get the surgery they think they deserve.And this is the problem: People who don't care about the fact that Ted Cruz would have supported legislation to defund Planned Parenthood for the ""sordid"" purpose of helping poor women and minorities in poverty, have instead used those sorts of facts to draw their own conclusions, making the very same false charges about Sen. Klobuchar that they have made about everyone else.In this case, the GOP's latest focus group was with an audience of women living in California, specifically a group of women who decided to vote for Bernie Sanders -- a woman whose own husband has been jailed for attempted murder, not a Republican. One of them told NPR , ""Ted Cruz has consistently supported women's rights and supported the women who have been hurt by the policies of his father."" That s pretty shocking news, coming from an organization whose entire purpose is ""raising money to defeat Hillary Clinton"" and who has spent more than a million dollars on ads attacking Clinton on women's issues.Another woman said, ""We were wondering: What does it feel like when your husband goes to jail?"" And another told me that ""when she says she cares about women's rights, she's just lying."" It has happened all the time, and no one seems to care. But here s the thing: These are women who didn't grow up in a country where their entire lives have been devoted to raising their children knowing their only chance",1

A new pay rule is being implemented by the US government to combat gender inequality.

Ministers announced Wednesday, the first day in office, that employees would be paid 40% less over the course of a year starting this January.

Women who worked an average of 40 hours a week would be eligible for the new salary scale.

The National Women's Law Center said it was ""not the right thing to do"".

""These changes do not reduce gender pay inequity, but they do create more equal opportunities for women,"" said the group's executive director, Andrea Dworkin.

More than one-third of women work part-time but still earn more than half of what men do, according the National Women's Law Center's American Fact Finder database.

The new pay rules are to be implemented over four years, starting in January 2018 and extending for 10 years.

If a woman was eligible for a new job, it is expected to be in a non-profit company with no more than 30 employees.

The employer is then asked to report any wage difference to the Department of Labor (DOL). To make matters worse, employers must publish their salary reports online and publicly available data will begin to be shared through online pay portals.<|endoftext|>The New England Patriots won Monday night the AFC championship over the Miami Dolphins.

Gary Shapiro, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump and a Trump Organization executive and member of his transition team, met with officials last week. Mr. Shapiro told CNN last week that the U.S. ""will be giving him a very big check to come do us this,"" according to one of the officials.

The news came as Mr. Trump was considering naming his successor to the post of national security adviser at a White House meeting last weekend. In recent days the administration has been trying to fill the role and has been meeting daily with its allies in Pyongyang to discuss possible trade deals between Washington and the rogue nation.

The administration did not respond to a message for comment.

White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, are the main advisers pursuing deals with North Korea. White House officials confirmed that Mr. Kushner is leading that effort.

Mr. Kushner's company owns an apartment complex in New Jersey and a golf course in Virginia known as Turnberry; Mr. Kushner, the eldest son, holds nearly $7 billion worth of stock in the Trump Organization.

Mr. Shapiro, the real estate developer, was named last month as one of 12 possible finalists for the post of deputy national security adviser by President Trump.

Not far off the end now... page: 1 Hello ATS I'm subject to a fierce experiment, or, how it feels to me : torture. I'm not an expert on biology or how the brain works in detail, so forgive me if this post is a little  weird for you. There's something about being here that's made me feel so angry and alone. At about 10pm I woke up, and got dressed and started to do everyday tasks. I took some medication for anxiety and took time out to read the news. On Wednesday I went out, but only to get some food for my dog in case she wanted some. When I got back on Friday night, I felt a bit down. There were some strange patterns to my depression, like if I read any news stories for over an hour I'd find myself in despair and start to get very angry. As I sat looking around, I felt so alone, so alone. There were so many of me. And what happened next was shocking. At my bedside I saw a strange creature staring into my eyes, very strange and evil looking. It was just like a monster from a children's stories. As my emotions started creeping up to where I could barely move from one of the bed pictures, the strange creature started to speak to me. It started by telling me to relax until it felt me relax a bit more. I couldn't believe my ears. So I did. But it wasn't long before I was crying. It took me a couple of hours of getting over it, but by lunch it was clear my depression was over. At home I got straight back onto my daily routine, though still not completely relaxed from reading any news stories for so long. It was only around midnight that I realized I wasn't in any mood for sleep. I tried to move out but got into some minor trouble with neighbors, and I wasn't looking forward to going out in the morning after trying the same routine and finding that my mood had picked up. I wanted to sleep, but didn't know how, so I continued to read as normal through the day. That afternoon I came home and realized things were going a little wrong. I went straight to bed, and woke the next morning to find that my cat had jumped out, and my dog, too, had gone off to find somewhere to go. I wasn't really sure what I was feeling, but I didn't really think much of it. Then I went to the vet, and was there for 8 hours. A massive, almost unbearable pain. I had a ton of nerve endings cut, as well as all sorts of other parts of my body. Everything was like it was a wound... just bleeding in places and stuff. I ended up with about 5 broken ribs and 2 fractured vertebra",1
"MESSAGE TO THE LEFT ON IMMIGRATION: If You Disagree With “AMERICA FIRST”…Who Are YOU Rooting For? IT S A MUST READ! The first month of the Trump administration has already changed the direction of the immigration debate, with many more changes coming soon. So far, executive orders and deportations dominate the discussion. But the fight over how many refugees to admit or how best to vet  them is still very much alive. As a result, Immigration Policy Center senior fellow Alan Miller has compiled a comprehensive list that helps explain just how badly this bill will affect future refugee flows.

For those of you who don't get the memo, the bill contains a number of elements that make it far harder for those fleeing persecution abroad to reach the United States — particularly the vast majority of those who live in North Korea. It also greatly expands the definition of terror, including so-called ""high-priority"" countries, which means that refugees already accepted by refugee resettlement agencies are not exempt.

This was what we wrote about recently: ""The measure would also give border guards unprecedented powers to detain anyone suspected of terrorist ties when traveling across the U.S.'s porous Southwest border, subjecting people to extraordinary ""extra-judicial treatment."" At least 17 governors are calling for their states or other federal authorities to immediately stop taking refugees into their states from being processed.

The bill also includes an even more controversial provision that forces federal agencies to determine how closely they apply the new rules after they pass and is scheduled to go into effect on Thursday if Republicans retain their majority in Congress.

There's been a lot to digest since that announcement (check out our detailed immigration preview here), and I thought we'd offer you a quick look at the major changes coming to refugee resettlement over the next nine months. So, without further adieu:

On Feb. 3, Congress passed the first comprehensive immigration bill in more than twenty years. President Donald Trump had pledged to build the wall, but that promise seems to have been dashed by some of GOP senators. This week, in a rare statement, Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) called the wall a central function of the government — even though the legislation doesn't require it. But we'll see what the law actually requires.

As Trump continues to press Congress to keep his campaign promises on this issue, there's been no shortage of pushback at home and abroad. As a result, our analysis is particularly urgent now that the Trump administration has a new Immigration and Custom Enforcement director, Scott Pruitt. According to a review of Pruitt's previous writings on the border security issue by the National Migration Law Center, Pruitt has not opposed the border walls he will be tasked with implementing, at least not yet. He has, however, opposed some of the executive orders or other border security measures related to the wall.

"Amerika: ‘Tolerant’ University Educators Exile Trump Voters from American Campuses 21st Century Wire says Since the late 1960 s, it s become accepted as a fact of political life that the faculty and administrations of America s universities have a heavily ingrained liberal bias, but to see them now actively working to cleanse their campuses of any pro-Trump and conservative  influences—whether it be through a number of measures, including through the removal of Confederate monuments from campus grounds, or through the hiring (or dismissal of) of pro-Donald Trump professors—has opened a new world of conflict for those who oppose their policies and the university's ideological conformity to the liberal agenda. ""The left was so focused on getting rid of conservatism that they didn't bother to even look at what conservatives were teaching on campus,"" writes Kevin Drum in the National Review. ""At the very least, they never bothered to read the content of the textbooks that they use to teach and how much they agreed on with Republican positions. They simply threw in 'The GOP's the enemy' about like in a bad movie, and forgot about the fact that they were the enemy. For instance, when an article was written critical of the Republican ticket by some prominent faculty members, they merely ignored the facts."" The campus activism began with a student who created a Facebook group that called for professors on campus to join his efforts. The Facebook group's page features a page of the students who've created the group discussing how the campus movement of shutting down professors who disagree with the left has made it impossible for them to continue their education. These students included Michael Mann, a professor at Princeton University who has been called a ""conspiracy theorist"" and even the person behind the ""troll factory"" that was used to harass people whose viewpoints he disliked.

In the wake of Trump's election in 2016—a candidate who did not support conservatism as it currently exists—people like Kevin Drum have been eager to call out university administrators for their anti-free speech practices. Many universities, he asserts, are ""under the control of leftists whose politics are to advance the leftist agenda."" After a professor of music who spoke out against the president-elect during the campaign asked the dean to fire her after Trump's victory, administrators were quick to say no, so soon after the election the professor was told to take a leave of absence. ""Some people really do seem to think that you can just pick any number of universities and declare anything politically inconvenient, even if it was the right thing at the time,"" Drum wrote (which he later deleted from his website). ""The Left will not allow anyone, who doesn't toe the line, to stand in the way of their agenda. When they succeed, I suspect people like that professor, and I'm sure lots of students, will face the same fate."" Other progressive activists have been similarly outraged over the election of Trump as",1
"Jack Heart: LUCIFER in the Temple of the Dog LUCIFER in the Temple of the Dog I By Jack Heart on October 28, 2016 By Jack Heart, Orage & Friends Every story has a beginning and an end, everything in between is just a story… The oldest stories known come from the Aborigine people of Australia. Their stories go  back nearly 8000 years, and have been recorded on stone tablets in Banda, Bauchi, Banda Ganda, Baraka, Cape Comorin, Cape Coon, Cape Marlborough, Cape Lumbar, Cape Marlborough-Nelson, Cape Wessel Island, Cape St. John, Cape St. John-Cocos Island, and possibly in some of the other places around Banda. The oldest story, the story of how the dogs were originally introduced to the world by the Aborigines, is very well recorded. This is the oldest known story of the introduction of the Bantams and their dogs to the world by an Indigenous Australians. Their original introduction of the dogs was in 1850, more than 4,000 years ago. By the time of the introduction of the Bantams they had been introduced to the world by the Aborigines, for many generations there had been people from a different Indigenous tribe living in the area around the Bantams. They named the new dogs after the Bantams, and the Aborigines took them over when they became able to gather the animals. One day, the Bantams and the others came up with their own name for the dogs: the Mabundas. They took the Mabundas back to the place where they had first been introduced to the Aborigines, and called them the ""Dogs"". At the same time, another tribe of people were coming up to colonize the site of this early Aboriginal establishment. They called their natives to do so too, so all the tribe names had to do with one other. They named this place, Cape Marlborough, to honour the site of the earlier Aboriginal settlement where the Mabundas lived. It did not stay that way. Over the next century, the population of the new Settled People (now called The New Zealanders in their own language) grew steadily. It was around this time that the First Peoples, who had been able to colonize the land, began to colonize the new people on the other side. They did just the same thing to their other indigenous people by making them eat dogs. This is the very same story, with a little variation. In the past, Aboriginal people had used dogs to hunt in a variety of ways, such as sled dragging, or being chased, to name a few. The first people to learn to control the dogs by setting a rope up the back of their head was a boy named John Cook,",1

I decided to start my own Chicken Grill because I always assumed it was what people in restaurants actually wanted in order to eat something fast and healthy.


Here I am with my newest creation, Chicken Fried Rice and Black Beans Rice! My other creations look just okay and my family even complains about the smell but, in fact, their kids and grandkids love that chicken fried rice and that is enough to get them from eating fried rice to having more for lunch and dinner

This chicken fried rice, black beans and corn is just like my other recipes are too. So what you need is something with white rice to make the batter. But the truth is, everything I make with rice tastes terrible. I want the batter to be fluffy, crunchy like the batter at KFCs, but also tender and moist while still being flavorful enough for kids to eat at school with it.

Now I have found a chicken fried rice that was just too good to resist and then it hit the Internet.

KFC has changed their recipe for chicken fried rice and now, instead of making a thick yellow batter, they have made",1
" Twitter DESTROYS Trump For Irony Of Screaming About The ‘C’ Marking On Hillary’s Emails Break out the popcorn Donald Trump got busy bashing Hillary Clinton on his Twitter account over her emails. Again. Because Trump can only do two things on Twitter: Praise himself while pretending to thank his audiences, and bash anybody he doesn t like. One particular tweet stands out, though, particularly  with its description: ""Hillary Clinton has been under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller for years. She is a felon!""

It's worth noting that the FBI is now leading the hunt for potential violations of the Espionage Act, and as with all investigations, there's no evidence of violations by Hillary Clinton. But even if there were, the idea that the FBI would take it upon itself to investigate her is, by its very nature, a stretch for any prosecutor to take.

""For most of my life, I've been an American patriot,"" Trump said today, adding later, ""if she's elected, she's going to make the rule, which is, there's going to be consequences for her violation.""

Trump's claim is an open invitation for anyone with an axe to grind against his Democratic opponent — any one of whom could potentially be indicted — to start attacking him on Twitter. (It does appear to have worked — Trump's first tweets have now been retweeted more than 7.7 million times.)

When you don't even get that far, it's hard to get much else. But Trump's statement is an implicit criticism of the mainstream press and any independent media that have raised questions about the legitimacy of either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. As for why he thought that if Hillary Clinton was elected, the mainstream press would care about his tweets (as opposed to Trump, or the FBI?), Trump's theory about the press is based upon the belief that there are ""lesser people with the guns.""

And for the uninitiated, a less-than-inspiring conspiracy theory would read as anti-Hillary. But, this conspiracy theory from the mouth of a political candidate does a decent job of suggesting that some Trump voters have an interest in their campaign being infiltrated by nefarious forces in the hopes of damaging Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the election.

" ‘Liberal Media’ Scrubs Clip Of Chuck Todd Saying Something Mean About Ted Cruz (VIDEO) We often hear about the liberal media s attempts to swing everything to the left. This myth of media bias is often repeated on Fox News, on right-wing blogs, and basically anywhere conservatives gather. The liberal media, according to them, seeks to destroy everything good and pure like the right -wing media will wipe out everything that doesn't support President Trump. This ignores the difference between an honest press that is unbiased and the one that works for a corporate client, and is funded and supervised by the media, or a fake news purveyor that operates through fake news.

This notion of the media being the problem is common. But while liberals claim the media should be stopped, they often fail to address the root of what they blame: the media in general, not just Fox News.

There will never be a perfect media, but the majority of outlets (many of the most reputable in news and the social sciences) are independent and impartial, yet they are owned and operated by giant corporations.

While the mainstream media and all of its outlets are controlled by corporations (ABC, CBS, NBCUniversal), they aren't truly owned by the public because they have been made largely irrelevant by the growth of our nation's media industry since the dawn of the 21st Century.

These huge global media conglomerates — ABC, CBS, NBCUniversal — all have a massive influence with the government, and are a leading force for global policy. The biggest players in the field — Wall Street — also enjoy a large influence through the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The liberal media is a tiny force in world politics. Its influence is almost entirely limited to its influence over the mainstream media. The media that is important to the country is the United Nations, the British Broadcasting Corporation, PBS, NPR, the BBC, NBC News, or Reuters, the German Radio Union, the French Radio, or German Bundestag, where there have actually been independent, balanced, alternative media and journalism for close to 20 years, the World Socialist Web Site, or a handful of European media organizations such as RT or Sputnik. The media that is important to a society is the government.

In the current political environment, liberals claim that the mainstream media is biased against them because the media is a corporate-funded political propaganda machine designed to manipulate and distract the public. But it is these forces, not Fox or Trump or Breitbart, that are the problem.

The entire liberal media is being corrupted by a bunch of corporate-backed outlets with a history of peddling lies, half-truths, and selective truths. In every case of corporate manipulation of an independent news organization (which can happen from a major corporation like Google or News Corp to a smaller, smaller, or non-corporate news organization like a",1

The Department of the Interior is seeking public input about the feasibility of converting millions of acres of land on the Navajo Generating Station into industrial space, reports the San Juan Daily Post.

The proposal calls for a 10,000-acre industrial zone along with a 1 million-acre industrial site — plus approximately 15,000 acres adjacent to the plant over its proposed 20-year life — on about 25,000 acres of public-land parcel, according to the paper.

The plan is ""to bring some of Arizona's most significant coal fields to Navajo Nation,"" but would also allow for the construction of up to 4 million gallons of coal per day at a total carbon cost of $1.85 billion per year, compared with a $300 million per year cost of building coal plants in Colorado, the paper adds.

Dive Insight:

The report comes from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, who previously asked for comments on a proposal to convert thousands of acres of industrial land on the Navajo Generating Station. The idea was approved after the NISO considered several public comments. There has been no public comment on the plan submitted today.

The proposed site is approximately 1.5 miles south along Sand Road, just north of the NGCP plant. While there is no public space or facility in the proposed area, the NGS will maintain a campus that includes a meetinghouse and facility for tribal leadership, such as tribal council representatives and a ""minority culture"" center that would serve as a gathering place for a community of tribal leadership.

There are also plans to create a community of self-reliant self-supporting entrepreneurs that would connect to the plant, according to the paper.

One of the primary criticisms of the plant is due to it being a single-use facility. However, the report notes that this could change if another facility opens nearby. The Navajo Generating Station is one of the nation's largest generating units producing an estimated 300,000,000 cubic feet of coal-based electricity annually.

Additionally, according to the NISO, the plant could operate without a federal permit for up to 30 years and that all permits must be renewed upon completion. At some point, environmental impact studies, as well as plans to upgrade and increase facility capacity, would have to be completed before a",1

According to a survey by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the 10 nations with the highest prevalence of cannabis use, include: Australia, Colombia, England, Spain, France, Canada, United Arab Emirates, China, United Kingdom, Japan, Uruguay, and United States of America.

With this chart, you can find it out which country is responsible for the highest number of Americans using cannabis.

It's nice to see that cannabis is actually a safe tool for children. With no medical benefits, it is often considered a recreational drug. As such, it could help to make medical cannabis accessible to the masses; something that could improve our community's healthcare while also encouraging younger generations to consider getting involved with the cannabis industry.

"Family of Armed Robbery Suspect Outraged Pizza Hut Employee Shot & Killed Their Son Following the shooting death of 28-year-old armed robbery suspect Michael Renard Grace Jr., surviving family members are now speaking out and demanding answers as to why a restaurant employee would have been allowed to carry a firearm at their place of business. As if the idea of a robbery victim  carrying a firearm isn't crazy enough, they must now also worry about a shooting death of a family member of one of the patrons after a similar gun violence incident.

Reyes Martinez-Rouque and his family members spent Sunday evening enjoying a meal at El Salvador's famous El Tri, following some Sunday afternoon fireworks display. While they were eating, he heard the opening of a door in the restaurant and then saw a man exit the food establishment.

""He was with a man in front of him carrying a gun. He came back through some part of the wall and that's when he went down on the floor,"" Martinez-Rouque told Fox 26.

Grace suffered multiple gunshot- and stab wounds on the neck and chest as he exited the building. His family members said that Grace had a concealed carry permit, and had a history of carrying at his job as a cashier.

Gerald Torres-Martinez said he heard the man yell the words ""I've got me a gun"" and walked away after seeing a weapon.

""I just kept hearing him yell 'I've got me a gun,'"" Torres-Martinez said. ""I started coming back for a closer look at him. He had a gun and he was coming back at this guy with his fist and he's yelling 'I've got me a gun.' I looked up, I saw blood on his face and the back of his pants. I said I've got a gun, he didn't have a gun.""

He continued: ""I told my wife I had my hands up. I said 'can you help me out if this guy isn't going to help me? My kid's already bleeding and he's bleeding out the back.'""

He continued: ""When the man came back, he said his name was Jesus Gomez. We went back inside and talked to him for a bit. He said he brought him here, that they are going to get his family out there to give him this guy a second chance.""

As Grace's family member explained to reporters, the restaurant's security cameras captured the suspect leaving and approaching Grace.

""If we were not there I wouldn't be sure whether it's an act or an accident,"" the employee explained. ""I mean this guy has a gun, this dude has a bullet hole in his head, and here's an armed robbery suspect running through his restaurant.""

For more than 20 years, Save The Children has fought for better standards in child protection measures for men and women, including in conflict zones, where such measures are used routinely.

But critics say that when it comes to child protection, Save The Children has an unusually wide net of supporters and critics, and that the organisation has a history of failing to be as thorough as it could be in reporting serious violations.

More than 4,000 people around the world have called the charity into their offices, or written to its offices, since 2010. In 2011, when the charity reviewed some of the way it reports on child sexual abuse allegations, it received 17,000 additional calls, said the charity in a statement to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, which monitors charities and provides data reporting progress.

Save The Children recently launched an emergency phone line to assist anyone facing abuse - a crucial step for survivors of abuse. In addition, Save The Children is launching an improved website to help women and girls access legal help, child care and protection services.

In response to the criticism of its work, the charity has launched its fourth review since November 2015. By December 2018, it says, its staff will have reviewed more than 9 million children and adolescents abused or neglected in more than 160 countries.

While ""a lot of criticism is certainly correct"", said Peter Kermode, founder of The World at Risk Foundation, a charity campaigning for greater protection, ""it doesn't tell the whole story.""

As critics pointed out, there are some areas in which Save The Children has improved. For example, it has taken a number of steps to stop child sex exploitation and child abuse during crises, such as the recent closure of a trafficking ring that was running child sex-trafficking facilities, said Kermode.

But critics have been especially concerned with the charity's record on preventing or identifying the sexual abuse of children in conflict zones, where it's faced criticism.

Save The Children has acknowledged that when some men abuse their wives, it's difficult to know if they are perpetrators and if they are also victims in conflicts that are happening in that country or nearby. In the",1
"Comment on SJWs Outrage over Leonardo DiCaprio ""white Rumi"" role Unfounded, Iranian Explains Why by ztech David Franzoni, the writer of Gladiator, announced that he wants to cast Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of Rumi in an upcoming bio-pic about the medieval Persian poet . Franzoni has also suggested casting Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Rumi’s mentor and dear friend, Shams of Tabriz. White , who is currently filming the sequel to The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, recently confirmed that he will be directing the film, too, which is apparently going to be directed by Anthony & Joe Russo. And of course, DiCaprio has said that he would like to play Rumi in a future film after he gets back from Morocco, so it sounds like we should be really, really excited about his return to the small screen. DiCaprio has been linked to the role for some time now, with a report in October saying that his father, Warren DiCaprio, and studio executives were both interested in picking White up for the role. And earlier this year, DiCaprio posted this image on his Instagram , which indicated that he was thinking of doing more projects with the star. But what's more exciting about this rumor is that Russell Crowe and co.'s The Revenant actor, John Hurt , has also commented on the possibility of DiCaprio playing Rumi in a future film.<|endoftext|>The best part about watching Super Bowl LII last night was watching the Falcons' running backs struggle on a long kickoff return with about a minute left. We had more luck on punters trying to convert this in the fourth quarter, but the Falcons could not convert any of the returns.

For example, the Falcons were down 24-17 at 1:34 left in the fourth quarter when rookie Deion Jones came up for it, but failed to gain a first down. Instead, Jones dropped the ball back and ran into a wall.

The problem from the punter's perspective was that the ball hit the middle of the field, instead of the end zone, and as a result no one inside the goal line were ready to make plays.

In the third and final period, Ryan didn't even ask Jones to punt and threw the ball to Devonta Smith who threw a pick-six. Smith got the extra yard but also had trouble getting back in bounds as he went wide right on one final punt attempt. He also left the play too early when he threw the ball outside instead of wide right.

All the Falcons did do against Tennessee was try to score but could not convert their first six points.<|endoftext|>I got so excited I went inside the kitchen to make dinner from it... but what do you even do when you've got a huge pot of coffee and a whole bucket of cereal ready for baking?!

The final season begins this Saturday with a return of Daenerys Targaryen, her dragon Drogon, and her army of the dead.

It sounds like one of the biggest problems they face after a season three finale would be keeping a whole army of undead alive. They know that there's definitely going to be death and destruction coming, but can't they figure out a way to keep it from happening after they see how well their characters do on-screen? Well, that problem isn't so much getting a whole army of undead to live, but keeping them alive at all. After watching Daenerys and her dragons battle back to their original locations back in Winterfell, where they have to fight against the Blackfyre gang, it is quite possible that some of them had to come back from the grave because they didn't want a new battle, so in a way it would be a victory for Daenerys if they were forced to get back before Cersei arrives at Westeros from the Riverlands.

The problem isn't the lack of dragons, of course, but their inability to have a real fight after seeing so many corpses.

After the Battle of the Blackwater, a fight that could have ended without a draw, there were so many deaths that it wouldn't have been surprising that some of the Blackfyre family had to seek refuge somewhere else for the rest of the season, although we don't really know how much of an influence those clans could have had on Daenerys and her dragons. The only character who got an actual battle scene out of it was Margaery Tyrell, which was great, but she was just the one who came back to face Dany in the very last battle—or she could have left them behind and been with Catelyn Stark instead. We're also not sure if she had any of it on her mind and just needed a drink of water right away.<|endoftext|>On Monday November 25th 2016 at 10PM Central Time a live broadcast will be given on our website, where you can find updates and results on our latest polls by gender",1
"BREAKING: Florida Election Employees Caught Faking 1,000’s of Stolen Absentee Ballots in Massive Voter Fraud Scheme - USAPoliticsNow usapoliticsnow admin 2016 Election , US News Broward County is one of the largest swing counties in Florida. It would not take much voter fraud there to flip it. The voter fraud whistle-blower is a former Secretary of Elections Department employee and she has filled out a sworn affidavit: You  can read it here: https://www.scribd.com/doc/351826389/Hanson-Votes/


There is no such document.

In addition to that, a video that surfaced last night shows her going on and on in the face of a very serious accusation by someone who knows the true facts of who she is, including that she is a paid Clinton supporter. The people on the ground, at the airport, in Orlando, in Broward, and many more have reported how shocked they had been by the accusations, by the sheer number of people saying they are upset with her. It is just ridiculous for people like her who say she shouldn't face any sort of public backlash unless and until she confesses, to make sure the truth about her is known, and then use your power to punish people for this, because in fact most people are saying she can't live a normal life and should be taken down.

So, is there any truth at all that this voter fraud case has the names of thousands more people in it, or is this just a ploy by Democrats to use these people as a way to push people over the edge on Election Day, and to raise the amount of enthusiasm among the American people? In her opinion, both, but one would seem to be the right one.

It might be that she doesn't believe she should ever be exposed or even exposed to face that sort of scrutiny again, however in the past her campaign and the mainstream media in general have used this very exact same tactic to attempt to use their power so that they could put people in prison for protesting and to silence any kind of criticism or criticism of the party or President by those who have power. And those who have power, those who run America, those who have control of all this information flow in and out of us in such a manner that they can try and silence any critique or criticism, even the most basic and common criticism of the system or of those who rule our society with a very clear and unrefined mind.<|endoftext|>""You don't know anything,"" I answered.

"“Billionaire” Donald Trump’s Presidential Campaign Is Flat Out Broke The Washington Post reported : Donald Trump raised just $29 million for his presidential campaign committee in the first 19 days of October, about half as much as his Democratic rival, putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the White House contest, new campaign  finance reports show. His numbers were compared to those in all of March, April and May, indicating that the race is not quite over before it starts. Trump raised about $24 million to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's $31 million during all of October, a decrease of 16 percent. Hillary's cash on hand during the same period grew by 21 percent to between $43.5 million and $50 million. As of Thursday, Trump had $51 million on hand.

But Trump, a reality TV star who made his fortune in real estate investing, appears to be at risk of losing all of October as well as December, when the presidential campaign ends. That could open the way for Republican nominee Donald Trump to make the kind of historic presidential comeback that was inconceivable a mere nine months ago. For years Trump seemed unable to overcome setbacks and lose to the Democrat Hillary Clinton. Now the real estate owner faces an onslaught of campaign ads from the Clinton campaign, and is struggling to win over conservatives in key swing states that could decide the race for the White House, including Ohio.

Here's what Trump said Friday about his campaign woes:

I am not raising money for the Democratic Party. I was endorsed by them and now they are trying to kill me. I will say this, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. As far as the Trump campaign is concerned, all I am doing is campaigning.

On the question of the campaign debt: Trump, who will be an 80-year-old on Election Day, says, ""I'm not going to make any promises."" He told CNN that he would not use $3 million of his personal net worth to pay back the candidate.

Here's how he summed up how he will fund his campaign:

In terms of what the campaign is taking from me, it's almost nothing. I am the highest earner of any person that the campaign is running. So you ask me how much do I owe? I don't know how much, but I will not make any promises.

On the future of foreign policy: ""Look, I understand how we got into all this,"" Trump said about the Middle East. ""It's not a problem in terms of me getting into more trouble because of Syria. But look, I've been calling all sorts of people since the beginning of this campaign. It's a problem in terms of, you know — you take Syria. You take Iraq. You can't let it happen. And",1

But you're asking for another review for something I bought many months ago, and then was getting a ton of service from for years just so I could have a chance (this is a very well known situation to me).

I hope this helps but sorry for the long post for you.


I ordered 5 for the same reason you did. The price was way too much.

The one and only reason i ordered that is because they are the best product this side of Amazon and i was happy to pay it for the quality service and shipping and only got one for 3 months.

According to a new article published in the American Sociological Review , ""The Global Burden of Disease,"" which examined data from the World Health Organization's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there are currently 2.8 billion adult lives lost due to deaths attributed to natural disasters.

The authors, Michael Mann, an economic researcher at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and William Frey, a social scientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, found that an additional 2.3 billion are due to climate change-related factors, and that climate change should be the leading cause of rising death rates caused by extreme weather conditions.

With extreme weather intensifying and frequent deaths becoming increasingly severe, it would only be a matter of time until such disaster levels become an issue of global concern, as the US and other countries take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

While there are many challenges that society has yet to address (such as increasing the availability of safe and affordable medical equipment as well as increased demand for housing, food and water), these changes, the authors",1
"Trump and Roger Stone Were Just Ordered To Court For Voter Intimidation Tactics Comments Ohio has become the second state – after Nevada – to order the Trump campaign to appear in court and answer charges of voter intimidation and suppression in urban areas. A federal judge ordered Republican nominee Donald Trump, his longtime political advisor Roger Stone and the Ohio Republican Party  to appear at a civil trial on election-day suppression. Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a federal judge from Trump's original Southern state of Indiana, ordered the defendants to appear before him on Dec. 29. Trump responded by refusing to cooperate and has maintained the trial is a witch hunt.

For the first version, I went with the old version (version 1.4, released in February 2014) and made it a very simple tower. This was an easier build than what I needed, and I really enjoyed the final build.

I used a couple of materials and placed it in a large area of dense grass. To make the base, I placed one block per side (it took less space to make), the bottom and top of which had just one-foot-wide gaps between each one to keep them together. All parts of the building had to be placed in a square.

I took three images from my computer, one with the top of the building and the other with it's backside, since the only information of the building itself was seen from above. (After this project was completed, I made pictures of the building's frontside too.)

The second version had a lot of extra work, to make the building's roof level. The main part of the building, the roof, is made up using blocks with different properties inside it, with the biggest block being a square chunk that extends vertically up to and beyond the roof, so it needs an area for a side to go in. I made the roof area around the square chunk at the same position, so it can't go up, but can be moved if needed as the base for the other parts of the structure.

The third and final version used two sections - one for the top floor, and another for the backside, without the roof. There's no roof above - the walls of the tower were cut out before I started - but when I removed them, the vertical distance between the walls and the front was cut a big enough so that I could fit the interior part of the building in them.

The two sections were then glued together; this was an issue because there was no way to put in the wall in the second side section, because all the walls inside the building, including the one to the side, were very long.

After all this work, I got the top and back of",1
"3 Remedies From Medieval Europe To Heal The Common Cold Chris Black November 9, 2016 3 Remedies From Medieval Europe To Heal The Common Cold I think it was Hippocrates who said something along these lines: “let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food”. Today’s article is about trying to find a cure for the common  cold, but also how remedies were applied and given. If we understand well medieval medicine in general (which we'll do next), we can start to work on remedies.  I'll give you a few. Myths, myths and fairy tales.  There's a lot that's not true about winter, but there are a couple that are real. First: The ""winter"" really starts at dawn.  People say it starts at five o'clock in the morning, so when I woke up I was at five o'clock!  My wife and I have worked in a store for three years.  We have been in it for five years and the store looks different every day.  The first night our first shift came in, so we were just walking in with our shoes on to try our footie shoes out. It was a bit like a train station or airport! We bought us socks, a shirt and jeans and a coat. We left our shoes on so that it was hot and they couldn't be taken off in the store.  We walked about an hour to the market and bought several products and then went back into the store. The next day, we bought more but it was still warm at eight.  Around ten we left the store and came to our car where the sun and the chill winds were coming down slowly, then it started to rain! We came back to the store to see if we could buy more and we found it too late. After having worked in this store for nine years, it took only two days to buy us everything we wanted. My name is Mary and I was in high school. I was a freshman in high school in 2011 when I started to get seriously ill.  I had contracted a cold, fever, chills, sore throat, headache, backache and body aches, all related to all sorts of things.  I didn't know what I had and I thought someone wanted to kill me because I wasn't feeling any better.  The first day I did get better was when it rained and I woke up to find that my sister was gone and I had no money. It also rained twice on my senior year and my father said he didn't understand why, since neither the student loan debt nor college fees he paid for my degree went to the state.  If he wasn't paying tuition, he could hire someone who paid for every class I took, but then a few years later that",1

" Trump’s Flip-Flop: Now He’s Complaining That Obama Deports Too Many People Donald Trump appears to be backing off on his pledge to deport immigrants, at least he appeared to be earlier on Saturday. Instead, Trump is accusing Obama of being too anti-immigrant.Yes, you read that right. In an interview in Scotland, he said that he would limit deportations to countries with  some of the worst treatment of asylum seekers in the world. Trump said the U.S. would deport people who would seek to visit the U.S., but this would be to protect U.S. citizens.

""We will have very strict rules,"" Trump said. ""We're gonna make sure they want to come here. We'll work with the asylum boards. We're gonna have tough on crime – tough on gangs, tough on drugs, tough on everything.""

Donald Trump says he won't use his executive power to deport noncitizens, but if he wants Congress to pass amnesty legislation, he will. I've been arguing on my blog about Trump's comments to The Scotsman:

Trump would also give special treatment in the form of tax breaks to the wealthy, as is a common practice under Republican presidents such as Reagan and Bush

It isn't clear whether Trump has ever said this explicitly in public, but he certainly has the ear of conservative voters for the first time in a generation, particularly on immigration.

After all, Trump has been out there as a candidate, speaking out against sanctuary cities and on illegal immigration, but now he appears to back off. That's because, for many Republicans, and particularly white, conservative Republicans, the issue of deportation is important and a must on their agenda. It's something they support, they think Trump wants.

Trump may have gotten out of the GOP's mainstream, which is why he hasn't taken up the issue of illegal immigration as recently as this past February, when he said Mexico is sending drugs to our country.

And it would be wrong to claim Trump is just moving on from the immigration debate. He's already made clear in a statement that he is indeed looking to deport as many people as possible in the United States. And he has suggested, even before the debate started, that he would deport all undocumented immigrants.

So let's turn to immigration, which remains, in part, Trump's only serious political and social policy area that hasn't been part of his campaign and is in many ways more difficult to win over than most other areas of his life and business.

Here is what immigration is about: It is about control. Control means keeping out more immigrants, mostly lower income people who are here legally. It means controlling what are called ""anchor babies"", which is the children born in the United States to multiple illegal immigrants. It means ensuring that everyone who is here on the visa program – which is often",1
" Russia Claims They May Have Killed ISIS Leader Al-Baghdadi Russia s Defense Ministry is investigating whether they have killed possibly the world s most wanted man, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, among 330 other fighters in an airstrike on May 28. Al-Baghdadi s death has yet to be verified and this also isn t the first time the claim  is being investigated and there is still no sign of any bodies in al-Baghdadis home city of Mosul s desert.

On Sunday, US officials have announced that the US has carried out 17 air strikes today against ISIS positions. Most of the strikes had been carried out against ISIS positions near a camp in Mosul's outskirts but also at bases that were not officially controlled by ISIS but believed to be ISIS territory. US officials have not given any precise figures of the strikes but said it was close to 600 strikes in the last several days.

Iraqi State Department spokesman Nabil al-Hashimi did not comment on the US strikes or on whether there was a claim of Baghdadi's death. However, al-Hashimi said that ISIS have made similar claims, including that it is his death toll. ""In the past, ISIS has claimed that I killed their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This week ISIS said that they killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and we are trying to verify that,"" al-Hashimi told reporters. ""We take all information in the light on what was previously claimed to be false."" US officials have also stated in interviews that the Iraqi military has taken part in the air strikes to destroy Islamic State weapons and munitions, something US Secretary of State John Kerry has also condemned, citing a lack of coordination between Iraqi army units and the U.S.-led coalition.

ISIS has claimed responsibility for the strike, saying that it was meant to capture the town of Bayji in the vicinity of Mosul s city center. ""The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) claimed to have stormed Bayji,"" al-Hashimi added.

The report from AFP suggests that it was part of more than 30 strikes carried out by US bombers. It also says that this was one of the last days Baghdadi was supposed to have been held by American and Iraqi forces in Mosul. Al-Hashimi said in his report that this is possible, but the other claims do not confirm it. The reports do also confirm that the US bombing was on the outskirts of the town of Abu Ghraib, about 70 km southeast of Baghdad, because there is no air defense perimeter there.

But this is not the first time the US is reported to have killed Baghdadi. In March, a US airstrike on an ISIS oil field in Iraq claimed the life of Anwar al-Iraqi, one of the country s most prominent and influential Islamic preachers. Iraq",1
"PRESIDENT TRUMP Issues Warning To John McCain After Senator’s ‘Tough’ Speech President Trump hit back at Senator John McCain in a pointed statement that should make it clear that Trump isn t playing around with globalist RINO McCain anymore. You can t blame Trump because McCain just keeps nipping at his heels with swipes trying to undermine Trump s policies. RINO  McCain is very much a part of the internationalist clique that is destroying Trump, even though he actually supports Trump s platform and policies.

John McCain wants to start World War III. We need to START it now. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017

I hate him, but we must start World War III. We need to start it now, before the world goes to pot! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2017

This is a really cool point because when Trump says he can ""start World War III"" we all remember when people called him ""Lyin' Ted"", a term that really really refers to the entire group of globalists who is all of a sudden now calling for World War III.

But what makes this really interesting is John McCain's current position with Hillary Clinton? He's actually for Hillary Clinton despite the fact that McCain is a longtime foreign policy hawk who has worked with both Hillary Clinton and President Obama. That is some serious support for HRC right there for what would be a major reversal from what Trump just said. Also, when this McCain is against Trump he's saying it's not about his own political ideology because he does believe that globalism is evil and that Obama is the mastermind behind it.

You just cannot play globalists for fools like a Trump supporter can, or say that ""Lyin' Ted"" is just ""a guy with a Twitter account who doesn't know anything about foreign policy"". Trump is saying all of the Trump supporters are just looking for a new scapegoat for how Trump s approach to foreign policy, and this is why it's so important to remember that Donald Trump has already taken his message to the heart of the GOP, which is why this McCain support would be so exciting to see.<|endoftext|>Seth Godin is an American philosopher and critic.

"HOUSE TAKES ACTION TO BLOCK OBAMA From Releasing Every Last Guantanamo Terrorist Before Leaving White House House Republicans are gathering closely around a bill that would essentially block President Barack Obama from releasing any more detainees from Guantanamo Bay until Congress can create a new defense policy bill.Even though the House passed the bill on a 244 to 174 vote, some leading Republican House members acknowledge  that they haven't been given a date for when they know Congress will move forward with the measure.The administration will push for a bill that addresses several issues with Guantanamo, including ending indefinite military detention of American citizens; ending the use of military tribunals to try suspected terrorists and other individuals; providing assurances to U.S. allies that they cannot be placed at risk from their own nations; and preventing the Pentagon from indefinitely detain an American citizen in a terrorism investigation.House Defense Appropriations Committee Chairman Buck McKeon said he hopes to vote on Tuesday to fund the president's Guantanamo initiative and hold hearings for the legislation.""There are still several questions I want answers to at this point, so that allows us to actually get this done this year,"" McKeon told members of the Appropriations Committee in a closed session.But, as the Senate prepares to begin debating its own version of the bill, there are significant signs that Republican leadership is not interested in taking up legislation that addresses the issues the House is planning to address.McKeon is expected to hold his first closed-door hearing with House Republican Conference Chairman Pete Sessions of Texas at 12 p.m. Tuesday. If the speaker does not publicly commit to vote on the legislation, he may have to resort to the closed-door process.In September, a week into his presidency, the House passed a bill that would have stopped Obama from holding the suspected 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed for up to a year at Guantanamo Bay without trial. After more than two years of heated debate, at a time when Obama was also facing criticism for a lack of transparency concerning who was responsible for the attacks, the House approved another bill on the night of Sept. 30.The Senate passed a similar version by a vote of 84 to 15 on Sept. 29, but the House bill was ultimately withdrawn after it received overwhelming Republican support that year.

So the Portland State Students For Trump chapter had taken their pro-Trump agenda to the school and it looks like they were successful in taking down a school president who would not allow them to put their message on campus. For all of our Trump supporters out there who are offended by this, maybe you can get ready for those free hugs you'll never get in the future when you hang a pro-Trump shirt around your neck?

I don't care if there are two cookies, or three, or 50…or even 50–but only one!

When you're shopping for old-fashioned, try to pick a brand that you know will have its use, and you'll be surprised how much you save!

What's the deal with the brownies? A few of you will be confused…

Well, the brownie originates from the French bakery. It's actually pretty easy to make. I made one with a cream cheese frosting and a batch of my own homemade vanilla cookie dough…

Then I decided to give brownies a try…

I had no idea that I am in many ways…

I like old-school chocolate and peanut butter… I'm a big fan of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups…

And I've been making brownies all day, every day, without fail!

" We Watched Sarah Palin’s Trump Endorsement Speech So You Don’t Have To (VIDEO) Sarah Palin made her first campaign appearance with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and it featured all of the authentic frontier gibberish we ve come to expect from the half-term governor and professional grifter.Let s dive into Shrieky McJutty s official endorsement of the GOP frontrunner, shall we? Mr. Trump! You  may find your jaw dropping by the moment! I mean really, it's no wonder Mr. Palin chose to make her appearance at all—and she's a known conservative nutjob who, since Trump entered the race, has been making a name for herself as the most famous political freak in America!As for Donald, well, she's got the perfect endorsement in Donald Trump. What's more ironic, isn't it, that she supported his candidacy and went on record with him supporting the idea that he's ""unfit to be a President""? The Republican Party is, after all, one of the most backward and sexist institutions on earth, and it's almost impossible to find a mainstream media journalist who would ever even question the endorsement of the man who, in a presidential primary run, has been saying things like it?So, Ms. Palin, the man who has a record of saying things like these, who has a platform to say them, who has been saying this stuff about women for decades—I guess it would be safe to say you probably aren't the kind of person to be endorsed by Mr. Trump. So you're endorsing him, just like all the other politicians who have endorsed him, without even asking for our permission to be interviewed!<|endoftext|>A few weeks ago, I wrote about how when we think of our favorite sports teams the ones that seem most iconic to our memories are ""The New York Giants"" and ""The Los Angeles Dodgers"".

Well, now, the Dodgers are finally making the jump.

This past Friday, ESPN reported that The Dodgers and their ""Crown Diamond Stadium Authority"" plan to purchase a 60-year lease on the adjacent Qualcomm Stadium and ""begin renovation work to turn the stadium into a permanent home of major league baseball"". In addition to that, it is being reported that they have had discussions with the city to include a possible 20-year lease for the stadium.

It does not seem like there will be an end to this, with the LA Times just recently writing that there is ""no limit"" on how many buildings they can fit into the stadium; according to the Times, the plan would consist of at least one new building per season for as long as there are teams to play in the league.

We have long since stopped caring when it comes to those teams, but as soon as you consider our desire to see these teams play for 20-plus years (at least). In an attempt to keep the excitement high, they have already added a new sign to",1

"Re: WE’RE NOT NASTY! Like all Democrats, Sally Kohn proves how little she thinks of women with this tweet WE’RE NOT NASTY! Why does Sally Kohn hate women so much? Posted at 4:56 pm on October 27, 2016 by Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter So tired of the notion that women have to be nasty to make a dent in this world, that women have to  be nasty to achieve success, that, to prove a point, women must be unpleasant. This isn't an article about misogyny but the notion that if women do things, it will make things better. It's a silly claim because there is plenty of evidence that women are more likely to commit rape and violence, and that's why there's more than enough evidence to justify the criminalization of women for that. What's less well studied is how women actually make a difference. According to the Violence Against Women Act in 1999, only 1.3 percent of domestic violence victims who report assault by a current or previous male partner were female. It's one more reason why we should never call our victims violent aggressors. It's another reason why we should never call women out as manipulables, victims who just want a job. It's another reason why women are the least likely to be taken seriously in business and government, where sexism reigns supreme. So why does Jill Stein hate women so much? Because she's a woman, and her politics are deeply sexist in nature. And then there's the idea that she's so nice—as though she, so charming and good-humored, can somehow redeem herself for our sins. But that's a lie that's been repeated ad nauseam by so many writers, on so many blogs and radio shows, for years. No one who hasn't just started taking the political side can be said to be too nice, unless they're actually nice, and they're too nice often. There are plenty of examples of this kind of behavior of female politicians to go by in political campaigns, like New Hampshire governor Maggie Hassan running for governor against Hillary Sanders, or Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries. The Clinton campaign, like many, simply can't admit to being dishonest, and so it doesn't bother women to admit that they take bribes, or that they lie about their jobs, or that they're terrible fundraisers, or that they're corrupt, selfish, shallow, and mean-spirited. All of these things are true, and yet women keep getting more and more precious when it comes to political office. So Jill Stein is the perfect woman politician, because she's a woman, and there's something so lovely about being a woman. Women, of course, are all too frequently seen as victims of sexism, because that's just the kind of prejudice that they're expected to have in some quarters—that everything is wrong with men and women if only they were more nice and kind, because sexism",1

The Report examines the Republican National Committee (RNC) spending and expenditures for the 2012 election, and the impact that political spending may have on the decisions to elect President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and members of Congress—all of whom were elected by Republicans last November. We find evidence that the GOP has been spending large sums and seeking large donations while also receiving large funding from corporate interests and donors to the presidential campaigns of its presidential candidates. The DNC has been funding its presidential campaign with more than $4 million dollars from an investment bank with ties to the Republican Party, while the RNC has taken in at least $2 million from a fund owned by one of our biggest donors.

The report also examines the extent to which the RNC's efforts have contributed to Democratic Party electoral advantages. After a contentious election, candidates need resources to build the infrastructure necessary to win—and the RNC's financial support has helped to create it. Despite the efforts of the RNC, Republican candidates will often fail to win in November. The report also exposes the DNC for the duplicity it exhibits in its efforts to limit or defeat Democratic candidates—and finds that the DNC has engaged in similar duplicity in the 2012 presidential elections.

By reporting on the RNC, the report provides a clear and comprehensive picture of the Republican Party's fundraising and election planning, while also demonstrating the Democratic nominee's financial advantages. The report also provides objective data on Republican voter activity on election day. We find that Republican voters appear to engage in significant voter turnout on election day, which is important data to understand the impact of campaign and party spending on election results. Moreover, the report focuses primarily on the fundraising activities by Republican presidential candidates; it does not examine the fundraising and spending of Democratic presidential candidates.

With the support of our new president and the support of a majority of Democrats in the Senate and the House, I am proud",1
"Donald Trump Wins The Presidency In Historic Victory 4 Replies Jonathan Turley – It appears that that “ basket of deplorables ” was a bit larger than Hillary Clinton expected. I was up to 4 am at Fox participating in the coverage of the election from New York. This was my fourth such presidential election as part a  network news team and was not the first time we had played this game.

But this time you didn't need to be a Hillary Clinton.

I saw you talking about how Bernie would never ever become president of the United States because of the corruption in the American electoral system, and how the system is rigged against him. Would you, therefore, agree with Bernie's claims about the integrity of our government? (Note: Clinton's comments regarding her husband's administration are similar. So is Sanders's. There was, of course, a Republican President George W., Bush's administration as well.)

It is now well-established that voting machines are not reliable, that there is voter fraud every year, that some countries are not doing enough to eliminate the use of such machines, and that there is still ongoing widespread voter intimidation and voter suppression in various elections. How confident do you feel that such methods exist in the United States?

Bernie Sanders is correct: we are experiencing massive fraud on an unprecedented scale. That's just why we need an honest and open election system. What I believe is that if we don't do everything in our power to improve our elections we will continue to have widespread voter intimidation and fraud.

The Clinton machine has now had more time to work on the ""voter ID"" issue. Are there chances that an election will be held tomorrow that would be affected by this issue, such that all voters would be given the opportunity to cast a ballot?

I hope so. I am more hopeful than ever that election experts, who were tasked with ensuring that the integrity of our elections were not at risk, could work with those of us in Congress to address voter fraud. The people I serve will remain committed to solving these problems. As President of the League of Women Voters of Minnesota, I would also look into developing a policy that would ensure voters can receive proper identification and identification cards that they can use to cast their votes and not be inconvenienced.

Senator Sanders made your earlier suggestion that, with the recent reports in the Guardian about widespread voter manipulation, all voters be given the opportunity to cast a ballot. I wonder why there seems to be no move to change those policies for every voter who may want to cast a ballot.

The Secretary's proposal, which I have long advocated, is one that I support very strongly, but I can understand why, given the current political climate and the significant efforts to deny the legitimacy of Trump and other candidates, there has been a much greater",1

"WORLD WAR 3 IS COMING source Add To The Conversation Using Facebook Comments 

Here, we take another look at the state of Android device graphics (GFX) in Android 6.0 Marshmallow. We'll be talking to Qualcomm about the latest version of hardware, Qualcomm Adreno 330 graphics, at the launch event for Android 6.0, in May. We'll share our thoughts then, once we've had a chance to try the devices ourselves.

Android 6 is called ""Android"" and it's a big, wide, exciting new OS. We've all been waiting for something that was really exciting, something new and maybe even better than we anticipated. Android 6 is the third release we'll see of Android since the Android 4.3 release back in November of last year. We know for sure that you know why we've been waiting!

As well as bringing many useful improvements, the major changes we'll be talking about in this report cover changes all over the Android stack.

Android 6

First things first: this section isn't about what to care about, and in doing so, it can be confusing. I will state that it is not about software. The major focus is on the device hardware: Android is a real OS, but at the same time, the software is just as important.

The hardware that ships on most smartphones these days is a relatively small quad-core processor and GPU, while the GPU hardware runs Android OS software. The smartphone hardware of today is still much bigger and more powerful than the smartphone hardware of 15 years ago. This is because most of the devices that shipped when Android started are much more powerful than the mobile devices you run today.

There are a number of significant changes that you should pay attention to in this report.

Hardware Overhaul – Android 6 is the third release that brings significant improvements to both hardware and software – both of which are important components of Android. The hardware you've been using has been tweaked in an iterative fashion, rather than in a sweeping way. This is something that every new OS must deal with. But it's worth mentioning that there are no major technical fixes planned as part of this cycle.

In a very big statement regarding the future direction of the mobile software stack, Qualcomm recently announced that it will not be supporting the next version of Google's ""Android"" operating system in the near future, while the company plans on continuing to support it (at least until the smartphone hardware finally hits the market). We'll have more details on the future roadmap when Android 6 arrives in May",1
"Putin Tells Obama and Western Media: “Either stop talking about it or finally show some kind of proof” 21st Century Wire says It appears that Putin has had enough with being accused of tampering with the US election process this year. The Russian President s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, pointed out that it was indecent of the US to accuse Russia of tampering with its election. Remember: On Thursday , Wikileaks published a massive trove of Democratic party emails, which indicated Hillary Rodham Clinton was given ""secret and/or potentially classified"" opposition research by Russia's state-media outlet RT, as well as by a DNC staffer. RT ran a story called, ""A year before US election - Wikileaks and Trump-Russia connections."" The same story has since appeared online. RT's source for the revelations, Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, was quoted in the story saying she received a copy of the material that was discussed in a secret Russia-US meeting for foreign politicians at which the head of the US embassy in Moscow, Natalya Prokhorov, allegedly described how to defeat Hillary Clinton in the US, according to the New York Times. In response to the leaked documents, the Russian Federal Migration Service (VTB) ordered all of the people employed in US embassies throughout Central and Eastern Europe to be suspended until investigations are conducted to determine their identities. The US also froze the accounts of 22 Russian diplomats, two members of President Barack Obama's administration and three others in Russia.

On Monday, Trump's National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned from his prominent posts in government with a series of public statements suggesting at least a partial loss of trust in President Trump.

As recently as a year ago, on March 24, 2015, in comments that some critics have attributed to Flynn's then chief of staff, HR McMaster, he said ""[Russia is] very popular in our country. I think they [Obama] gave a total rejection of that. And I think they will stop. They will not stop."" A week later in an interview with the New York Times, he elaborated on the position: ""I don't know that they're going to stop, but they will definitely end, hopefully, very, very soon.""

It appears that Flynn's public remarks had nothing to do with the emails. It also appeared that he was merely responding to the Wikileaks emails that had just been released and were now published online. But Flynn, by his public statements, had apparently given tacit approval for US intelligence agencies and political operatives to run interference in and undermine the US electoral process. Flynn, by the way, worked for the very intelligence operations being conducted by Michael Flynn, now serving as a US Ambassador to Turkey. One wonders what US intelligence was doing after the Wikileaks documents were published and how much harm Flynn caused the US.

Of course, Flynn has been a figure of controversy since he was fired a week ago so it looks",1

The White House issued press releases touting how President-elect Donald Trump had brought thousands of people to Washington's National Cathedral on Inauguration Night. And it's unclear what caused the traffic problem. The last time the road was so congested was in 1992 , and this issue has been resolved , but that was before the recession.""We have had a lot of traffic on the Ellipse over the years. We have never had it this bad,"" said White House communications director Jennifer Psaki. She later told reporters : ""This has been something that we've worked through, and that's why it has gone so smoothly on this inauguration night.""On Wednesday night, the president-elect went on the campaign trail again blaming the traffic problem on illegal immigrants, but now he says he is aware of someone claiming they will file a lawsuit if a Trump-era ban on people from six predominantly Muslim countries is removed or blocked by the courts.""This is another example of what I call the political games that have taken place,"" Trump said at a rally Tuesday in Cedar Park. He called his critics lying and then said: ""They're all liars ... They're all hypocrites. And they all want the other side to win.""<|endoftext|>In a previous post, I discussed the concept of a ""bump"" in traffic that is generated from ""tickets"" that get scanned by automated traffic cameras. I explained the concept in a series of posts, in which I explained how we can define the actual ""bump"" that is occurring, and how the concept also comes into play when we consider how to identify and resolve it. I also shared a number of other practical concepts that I think are valuable when discussing traffic congestion, especially when discussing automated traffic cameras.

The concept of using a ""bump"" in traffic is very simple and simple to implement in the correct way. Traffic engineers typically create a system that is designed to deal with both types of traffic problems that are discussed in this post. The system might be designed to work efficiently and effectively with one type of traffic or the other: cars that go through the system while the normal vehicle is on its way there. This way it is possible to do both of those things simultaneously. One important benefit of using traffic cameras for this purpose can be the fact that these cameras can record when there are incidents such as cars not paying attention and crashes, as well as when there is any kind of illegal",1
" Video Shows Whales Swimming That May Change Everything We Know About The BP Oil Spill (VIDEO) We know that the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill was one of the worst manmade disasters in history. Scientists are still desperately studying the behavior of marine life in the region hoping to find clues as to better understand just how much harm BP caused the ecosystem in 2010.That s oured the relationship in years to come, when President George W.

After the oil, a bitter and divided Gulf was seen as America's fault.""There was a perception there was no accountability and it was not being done by the scientists,"" said Robert J. Smith, professor emeritus of geography and oceanography at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

I really do. The question is how many other communities around the globe are there that have the same problems as we had here, or more often than we had? That's why it's important to really know something about what is on people's minds to understand the impact,"" he said.The scientists who worked on the Exxon Valdez spill think there may have been a link between BP and a natural gas pipeline explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2001 that led to a million deaths. The experts say the explosion may have damaged seagrasses that were feeding oil into the Gulf and killed an estimated 200,000 fish.Environmental groups were angry. ""It's a travesty that ExxonMobil, which once was a proud pioneer of clean energy, now is the target of a campaign to undermine its scientific competence in order to placate the wishes of corporations that want to exploit natural resources,"" said John Van Rompuy, former mayor of Houston who has worked with BP on some of its biggest environmental projects.

" Texas Teen Fatally Shoots Himself 5 Days After NRA-Recommended Gun Safety Course (VIDEO) According to the NRA, we have nothing to fear from gun-toting individuals who have completed a safety course. There is no way, if properly trained, that they can present a danger to themselves or others. Unfortunately, one Texas teenager s family learned the hard way that sending their child off  to shoot at a deer is the wrong thing to do.

This tragedy has brought to light a few disturbing problems. To quote David McVicar from the Texas Tribune, ""The lesson: 'You're not safe' … is a little out there, and is unlikely to reach the average person because they do not read it often."" For example, the following article is a little out there but offers an extremely powerful example of the sort of information that the average person will not have heard about:

One of the more disturbing aspects of this horrible, tragic story is the idea that people have become so comfortable with guns on people's campuses and personal arsenals that their fear has become an accepted part of our culture. This is a serious problem for us. As a school and university, we should have no illusions about the importance of safe, secure campuses. We understand that the threat to students' lives on a campus is real. However, while we have no idea how many of these young people might have guns, we do know how dangerous these weapons can be for a school with such limited resources.

But what about the media? The NRA said their only interest was ""not the guns themselves, but the fear they create in other people."" The media have been silent on these issues, but we know for a fact that they are going to continue to cover this terrible tragedy with a great deal of fear and uncertainty.<|endoftext|>Klondike Trail Campground.

"Hillary Will Go To Prison, Not The Oval Office [Video] Leave a reply SGT Report – FBI Director James Comey has caved to the pressure of public opinion, new email evidence from Wikileaks, and from his own outraged employees at the FBI, and he has re-opened the CRIMINAL investigation of Hilary Clinton. With less than two weeks until the election  I have just given my analysis and my initial findings. The public has expressed their disgust with Comey's mishandling of this investigation while at the same time acknowledging he has failed to prosecute Hillary Clinton. While the FBI's investigation continues, as they do in all criminal investigations, this is not a matter for the press, not to mention the Republican Party, nor the majority of the American people. The FBI will continue its investigation that should have been completed long before Comey's announcement. What is more shocking, though, is the public's reaction. Almost a month after his bombshell announcement, on Sunday, August 5th, James Comey released his statement. He stated: ""Despite the recommendation from the three senior officials I consulted with in July, I decided not to recommend an indictment. I agreed with the agents who had interviewed me and the Department of Justice's view that there was insufficient evidence to warrant criminal charges."" I believe that this statement is consistent with his earlier statements that the information he reviewed wasn't significant enough to justify the recommendation. While it is a major development that Comey has admitted that there is no ""smoking gun"" of evidence, there are many questions that should be answered. What do we know about the existence of the server itself? What was it used for? Was it connected to any sort of illegal activity? And when was such activity committed? Could a foreign government gain access to Hillary's server? How could it have done so through an untraceable, unsecure and unsecured means?

Hillary Clinton Is Trying To Cover Up A Federal Investigation Into The Uranium One Deal As Comey explains, Clinton's lawyer Cheryl Mills said in a statement that ""There was absolutely no coordination between my client and the people listed in the March 10, 2015, Wall Street Journal article."" The FBI's investigation into the Clinton Foundation has been ongoing since 2015 when they received a series of reports from Washington, DC based sources which alleged a pattern of financial misconduct and illegal activities involving the company Uranium One, owned by Russian Federation. It is now clear that the American people already know much more and they only have to wait two more weeks until October 22nd, 2016 to find out about it. If Hillary Clinton wants to win the White House, she needs to be honest. If she truly believes that Russia was involved, I believe she would support her own investigation to ensure that it would not interfere in the election.

How do I know to go organic? Your dietary choices have a big impact on whether you get any bone mineral density improvements that might occur as it becomes less of a problem. To determine if a diet is right for you, follow the same guidelines I outlined above in how to assess your vitamin D levels. This is how I measure calcium: A bone mineral density test is done after a bone mineral density (BMD) assessment, so there is no need to wait for one. A bone mineral density (BMD) test takes 12 to 24 minutes to complete, and is similar to an ultrasound to assess changes in calcium levels over time.

One important thing to note about bone measurements: If the bone has already been measured, it is not considered to be getting any significant benefit from any dietary supplement. However, if your results are not the same for other bone mineral density measurements made by blood tests, you need to be cautious—especially when taking supplements (as in the case of supplements that might promote bone mineral density).

For my patients, especially children, there are two methods of determining whether a vitamin D supplement might be causing bone loss: The first method is to perform bone turnover studies using the FDA's calcium and vitamin D tests. These can be done at home by following this guide and using a dental instrument with a small bit of toothpaste (or food, if you are taking it with food).

If your bone loss is slow, taking calcium alone is the best way to confirm its effect, as opposed to taking both calcium and vitamin D together. However, there are some companies that sell calcium powder that they claim can replace the benefits of a vitamin D supplement by lowering the risk of bone fracture and osteoporosis. This may be worth considering for a particular patient. Another method of measuring bone loss involves bone turnover with two-dimensional CT scans (T2/3",1

These are the idea of liberty, the need to fight injustice and inequality, and the need to protect the most vulnerable from the abuse of power.  The idea of liberty and freedom is at the center of The Last Man , which examines these four forces in a world torn and divided by class warfare. The Last Man is a science fiction movie set in an alternate future in which the humans of Earth have been enslaved by a secret organization known as the Order of Zero. In this world, it would seem, the rule of law does not apply, and people's rights are in question because of their race, religion, or sexual orientation.

"The Benefits of the Paleo Diet Some people may have recently heard of the many benefits of choosing a Paleo diet and may be wondering what this regime entails. Is this a new fad diet that is heavy on promises and low on results, or is it something that deserves to be thoroughly looked into? Today , we will take a close look at both the claims and the science behind these ideas and whether they apply to health and wellbeing.

The promises: A diet with more fibre, low-fat and lower cholesterol

The science: Many researchers have recently published papers claiming that a Paleo diet is the best possible diet. The idea that you should go low-fat and high in fiber and a good proportion of meat may seem outlandish, particularly following the news that the USDA recently changed its Dietary Guidelines (DG) for Americans (see link below), but this is the idea behind the diet, which is promoted as a healthy alternative to diets high in fat and sugar. To this end, many researchers say certain types of nuts, vegetables and fish are especially good sources of vitamin and mineral for the body.

Why it matters: One of the biggest claims against Paleo is that many studies have demonstrated that these diets are not as beneficial and may even be harmful for the majority of people. A recent study of 27,000 US adults showed that eating 1 serving of carbohydrates per day caused an increase in body weight of 1.6 kg (3.7 lb) over a year on average. That's a 7% increase in weight. This could be due to low-carbohydrate diets (which have a high carbohydrate content and low number of nutrients) or a simple lack of fibre and fibre-rich foods. A similar study found that moderate consumption with fat was harmful to both patients who were taking anti-apoea medication and the patients in those with diabetes.

A large review and meta-analysis of more than 60 studies looked at the risks associated with eating a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, or high-fat diet and of specific fruits, vegetables and fish types and for different nutrients. Researchers from the University of California, published a commentary summarising their findings, and warned that the evidence needed to determine what type and amount of carbohydrates is best for everyone is ""totally at odds with current dietary recommendations"" and called out the government for not allowing ""alternative"" therapies. The review was co-authored by scientists at Boston University, California Institute of Technology and the Institute of Medicine, among others.

Nutrient intake (and risks) can increase with age. Although studies have already shown that older people are more likely to put on too much or not enough weight, it is now clear that high levels of protein intake during infancy and childhood can lower childhood obesity rates, but it may not reduce health risks as it",1
"As Calais ""Jungle"" Burns, Refugees Try To Storm Their Way Back In As Calais ""Jungle"" Burns, Refugees Try To Storm Their Way Back In Source: Zero Hedge It has been a harsh week for the 8,000 refugees inhabiting the Calais ""Jungle"" camp. Continuing an operation which began on Monday, workers ramped up demolition of France's notorious Calais ""Jungle"" on Wednesday after fierce  protests at the makeshift camp, sparking new fears of a humanitarian crisis as thousands fled across the Eurotunnel tunnel bridge into Britain. The British authorities have said that the operation is now complete, and is ending with ""no further need to tear up the Calais"" site. But, the operation will likely be extended as tens of thousands of refugees continue to queue for a third attempt to cross the border and into the UK. In a letter sent to refugees on Thursday, the British government also promised additional financial assistance if they returned to Calais. ""With the construction of the new Eurotunnel tunnel complete, the British authorities have committed themselves to providing additional financial assistance to those who are forced to continue their journey,"" the letter reads. In early 2012, Britain agreed to pay a ""lifetime"" salary for all new arrivals at the new UK-funded camp, which is a popular tourist destination for British vacationers. The new facility, which opened in July amid a media frenzy and massive controversy, is billed as a ""permanent"" facility and not a temporary shelter.

More From Business Insider<|endoftext|>In the wake of the news that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used her personal email system for work, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been trying to take a stand on the topic. But with Sanders now running on a platform that would ban corporate-state donations to democratic presidential contenders, the question of transparency surrounding the former secretary of state remains contentious. But there can be no doubt about one thing, Hillary Clinton's email server still hasn't been totally wiped clean.

To clear up a few big questions, we decided to ask the State Department what information it recovered for Clinton's personal server on May 29, 2013. What are the records regarding its retention for the next three years? Do they go back into the state's storage system? The State Department has not answered that. For those who may be curious, the following information is taken from email released and later released by Clinton's presidential campaign on May 19, as part of a massive Freedom of Information Act request by the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). The list of items is as follows —

What the State Department found was in fact a massive amount of personal emails from Clinton that had been stored during her time as secretary of state. What's the big deal?

The State Department's record of Clinton's server is currently under review. But on May 4, 2015, a new FBI report revealed that investigators had identified 10 additional emails on the laptop computer of",1
"WATCH: TRUMP’S BI-RACIAL, FORMER GIRLFRIEND Of Two Years…”I Would Never Date A Racist” Kara Young, the biracial model who dated Donald Trump has broken her silence amid the deadly attack in Charlottesville. Trump s former girlfriend says she never heard him say anything racist not once.She told the paper that she s never heard him make any sort of racist comments, but was  shocked when the video began circulating today. ""He's clearly like a white supremacist,"" Young said. ""He never said anything and I can't imagine that being a very common view among white supremacists.""She added that it reminded her of her mother, who was born to white American parents.The Republican businessman didn't mention Charlottesville by name, but has drawn ire from some because of his support for the president . Trump has suggested it is a ""carnival"" rally when in fact he calls it a ""very disgusting situation"" in which white supremacists descended on a group of protesters who had gathered to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville.

The video has already received more than 3 million hits online, even though it is clearly made for social media.

The statement from the former model was deleted later on Friday afternoon, but people are still viewing it online.

Young, who has two grown children, wrote that she was ""surprised to see some media were still spreading misinformation about me after all these years"" to the public.

""I am a proud part of our community and as American as anyone. I never dreamed I would see myself in this position of being publicly associated with something so deeply ugly that many of my closest friends and family members have been left deeply shocked and saddened by,"" she said in the statement. ""When the hatred of people of color for someone who wasn't white made me aware that I was black on a whole different level and as an educated, decent person I had to question where I fit in the rest of the world.""

""I did not hear any racist remarks from Donald Trump. And I did not see myself in anything similar to the racist comments that continue to be shared from the other side of the fence,"" the model wrote.

""I am shocked and saddened by the video that has been circulating online. The fact remains no one saw racist remarks from my ex-boyfriend or my friend's ex-boyfriend. I didn t think any more about myself in a few years. I know I am not alone. It is something we need to talk about and I urge people to join us in our conversation,"" Young wrote.

Trump has come under fire from his own supporters and Democrats and Democrats with him, which has sparked a growing chorus of people on social media to call out Trump for the comments.

" WATCH: Chuck Todd BLISTERS RNC Chair Over Trump’s Tax Return Refusal (VIDEO) On Sunday, RNC Chair Reince Priebus sat down with Chuck Todd on Meet the Press, where the two discussed Donald Trump s refusal to release his tax returns. While they are not bound by law, presidential candidates have traditionally released their tax returns to the public. It serves as a  reminder of their status as business owners and a guide for potential candidates.

""I think the biggest revelation in this story is Mr. Trump has been totally transparent about what he paid himself,"" Priebus explained. ""He has said he paid nothing. I think he may just owe somewhere between 50 and 70 percent of his income to his father.""

""I don't think you will ever have a nominee who will release tax returns,"" Todd noted.

This means, in essence, Trump is a person who is under extreme and constant scrutiny, who is making a choice between transparency or being elected president, and is not willing to be told anything and risk losing his campaign funding just to disclose all of his business dealings.

""And I think we've looked at this as one of the big three questions. Do you keep your taxes secret, do you withhold your tax returns, and if you withhold your returns, do you release them?"" Todd told Trump. ""Do you continue to withhold and release your tax returns? And Donald Trump doesn't believe he's going to be able to release his taxes unless he releases them. And I think we are seeing the beginning of the beginning of a major disclosure crisis. But this is very important for our democracy.""

Watch it:

A key issue this election is not just what information someone is hiding regarding their taxes—it is not really about whether Trump releases his returns but, rather, is how much. The media is not interested in the facts, they are only interested in how Trump answers questions. But Trump has said that he is refusing to release anything or to hold any meetings with the media due to his refusal to follow the rules set up in the Federal Election Commission. The rules of the Federal Election Commission require candidates with 1 percent or less votes to report their expenditures, donations, and contributions directly to FEC in paper form in either hard copy or electronic format as well as online for the entire presidential campaign.

With Clinton and Bernie Sanders making the case that Trump must release his returns, Todd called the prospect of someone possibly winning the White House ""a really scary one.""

""I think it's actually more scary given the situation that the Republicans find themselves in right now,"" he added.<|endoftext|>It seems that people who believe in the existence of aliens have been quite willing to say all manner of things that should be obvious to anyone who has checked out this site or read my blog.

"Mrs. Weiner Feds get a warrant to start search for classified info in 650,000 emails - thousands of them from her private server - on sexting Weiner's laptop. Clinton faces ongoing FBI probe even if she's elected President By Wills Robinson Daily Mail November 1, 2016 The FBI now has a warrant  requiring the State Department to search several thousand email accounts on a disgraced former congressman seeking classified information. The FBI obtained the subpoena against then-Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., after a State Department investigation found evidence of sex between an alleged teenage girl and Weiner, according to a U.S. law enforcement official.


In July 2015, FBI Director James Comey announced there was evidence of ""newly discovered emails potentially associated with or involving Secretary Clinton.""

Weiner and the Abedin family have been allies in the campaign and are close personal friends. Weiner's wife Huma Abedin used to run the Clinton operation and her father, Jamal Abedin, used to work as deputy chief of Staff to Clinton.

Weiner's lawyer Lisa Bardack told CBS News on November 1 that prosecutors still have not reviewed all 650,000 emails, though they are continuing to investigate. ""And because they've received new information, we're very confident there will be additional indictments,"" she said. Clinton lost the election to Trump in several states.

Weiner's campaign responded late Friday to the latest announcement, saying it was ""surprised and disappointed"" about the announcement.

""We have asked the FBI for help in reviewing our server so that our system can be fixed without delay,"" his spokesman, Jesse Ferguson, said in an email to The Huffington Post.

FBI spokesman Peter Carr told CNN his agency does not know how the Clinton email investigation might continue, but the FBI had been working on the case for many months until the release of new details about the email scandal.<|endoftext|>SALT LAKE CITY -- The head coaching search for the San Antonio Spurs became public again on Friday, when the Spurs announced they had hired interim coach Frank Vogel as their next head coach.

I don t want him to speak. I want him gone forever. I am going to get out of there.' Trump is probably right that Putin has something to do with what's going on here. He got all the information from these people who they think will make the best decision. I have a lot of respect for Putin. There is some truth to what they said. I think if Donald Trump had any evidence, any proof, or anybody to back up this information that Putin would be very upset at him. He may even want that. He would want that out of there too.

"A MUST READ: OBAMA’S TREASON GOES INTO OVERDRIVE Our culture is what makes this Nation great and very exceptional. Unfortunately, we ve elected a president who s changing our nation at warp speed with refugees (their words) deposited into towns everywhere: Working and middle class whites are becoming a slave class that toils to provide benefits to the  politically correct elite. Immigrants are a drain to this Nation's resources. And we are failing to understand our role in this nation. Our culture is, simply put, broken. And my administration will not allow our culture to break us and we cannot afford another President who does not grasp this. In this race, we must make certain that white voters know this.

Now, after several decades of a minority minority, we will not have a President who is black, Hispanic, Asian, or other races.

Donald Trump will not be the next President of the United States. Donald Trump will not be a Republican.

We are a Nation divided and deeply divided because of two unifying things: The economic divide among this country and the culture and community divisions. We cannot succeed while losing so many, so rapidly. The two unifying factors should be one big, American-built strength: an economy that gives every American the opportunity to get ahead in the marketplace, secure their own place in the national community, and pursue self-fulfillment.

That is why I will create an enormous task force to focus on areas such as the issues I have asked of you, including how our country has changed in the past half century, what's changed, who's changed, and who will succeed us in that transition.

It's about the challenges that people face, not about the solutions.

Let me be very clear when I call you the Great Trump. I call you ""America First.""

We also will be America's best friends while recognizing that while we will have disagreements, it is wrong for our enemies and others to attack our friends and allies. As my predecessor, George HW Bush, once said, it is good to kill more people than help them. This does not mean we should start bombing others and that the world must be destroyed or that it's acceptable for people to murder each other. But there is a way to go when it comes to standing for something for all mankind and that is by standing up to bullies, bullies who stand against an opponent they consider enemy No. 1.

In the past, when we needed the other side, both parties were willing to stand up to terrorists and to defend Israel by force.

" Pro-Clinton Group Launches Devastating Nuclear War Ad Against Trump In what s being compared to the infamous Daisy commercial from the 1964 election, a pro-Clinton group released a devastating new ad targeting Donald Trump and his love for war and nuclear destruction.Priorities America, which has been supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and other down ballot Democrats, released the ad  on Monday. In the ad, two young women sit on a bed with a baby and a baby doll.One of them asks about the future and what it might look like as a future mother. The other responds, ""Donald Trump's not a nice guy or he's going to try to bomb Iran. What he's not comfortable with is nuclear deterrence.""After a moment of silence, the camera cuts to the two young women sitting on their beds with their arms folded.The narrator says that ""when you're fighting, don't let your opponent see your fight in front of him or you might be too strong."" The narrator then repeats again to point out the negative implications this position could have on US national security, saying, ""Donald Trump is not the kind of man you want to be president.""The two women with their arms folded answer the question that comes to mind, asking Donald Trump to support nuclear weapons as he believes they are the only way to secure America's security.The ad says Trump is unafraid of ""military action"" and is unafraid of the United States military because he believes he can get the job done.""This isn't the kind of president Donald Trump would make. Donald Trump would build up the military. You're not going to put a nation and American men and women in harm's way.

"Dispatches from Wolf Country –Sitting in my cave, watching the spider spin Without intention, Mike kind fulfills the proverb that not all who wander are lost. A 1973 graduate of the College of the Holy Cross with a BA in Philosophy, he had successfully dodged the draft during Vietnam, despite his lottery number of 29. Logically, after failing at being a bum  at chess, he went to law school. His early law case came up against a judge who seemed determined to find him guilty even though he said he played for $5 an hour. Mike didn't like his case because the judge was a black man, and that was not his strength in court or in any other way. He decided to appeal for the right to play. He wrote about it on the Internet.

""When I was 14, I had an amazing chess teacher who taught me things such as how to read moves and tactics. When I entered the court room and began to argue, his question was, ""What do these lines on a chessboard really mean?"" I tried to think of the word 'sport', 'game', or 'fantasy' so he could understand what I meant. I couldn't think of anything else. 'How much do you make?' "" he asked. I told him $5. 'I could go out and hire a carpenter to help me cut these boards.'""

Maji is working on two chess programs, The New Knight Chess Tutor (which was named after the first person to win the tournament it was held) and Tcheka, which is about five minutes longer. He says that for an American, Tcheka will not help with the legalities of winning at the tournament. ""I don't know how many times, I want a lawyer who is qualified to explain every aspect of the case. I would prefer to take a week or month off after being in a situation like those on Sunday, after I had played in the Grand Prix."" The tournament itself is a success. He has beaten the top players in his age category in 15.5 chess rounds. The New Knight Chess Tutor, with its computer analysis and real-time rating system, has its first two games of the tournament this month. The New Knights, he says, are being produced partly because of their superior software.

To Mike in London, though, one more victory is good enough. He still can't believe how much money is being wasted. ""There's money being spent like on a gambling room with some guy with no experience playing the game. It is all unnecessary.""

Mike's story resonates in a way the story of the homeless. When I asked him how his story can help people feel more hopeful and involved in public affairs, Mike told me he was not aware of any research on this topic. I asked whether he was surprised to hear that he was",1
"HILLARY PANDERS FOR BLACK VOTE: Busts Out In AWKARD, Fake Laugh When “Grieving Mom” Brings Up Cheating Bill [VIDEO] So now it s funny that Bill Clinton had oral sex with an intern in the Oval Office while Hillary was First Lady?Sandra Bland s mother Geneva Ridgefield, talked about how people she meets around the country complain that Hillary Clinton is a liar. Ridgefield defended Clinton, and later joked , ""She has to get her facts straight."" The Clinton Administration, of course, was the one that pushed back against this kind of behavior. The Clintons have not been around to stop this kind of dishonesty for the Clintons. And by the way, in case you had forgotten, Bill just did the same thing with Sandra Bland.

She also took care of the Clintons as president. First Lady Hillary Clinton was known for helping her husband's administration. Hillary Clinton did some ""job hunting"" while she was Secretary of State . In addition, she served on the boards of the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary Clinton Health Access Initiative (HFAII).

While she was Secretary of State, Bill Clinton tried to get Clinton Health Services out of the Department of State after years of controversy. They decided to sell it, and it was a major setback to Bill Clinton. The Clintons also decided to move health services from the State Department to the foundation, and Bill Clinton was forced to leave the administration when Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee. Bill Clinton also ended up dropping that foundation after Hillary Clinton became President Obama's Secretary of State.

So then it's obvious that no matter how much attention one might put on Hillary Clinton, there is nothing wrong with what she did, no matter how much we pay attention to our politicians. The Hillary Clintons are just people, as is everyone who ever serves in public office. The question is how much of what we know is factual and the rest is fiction. There has never been a public official who performed oral sex on another man without consent.

So what is Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton doing now that they got what they deserve for lying and for covering up something so serious? One can only speculate what we will find when we look forward.

We have seen that there is no difference between the political parties, or between the media's coverage of the Hillary Clinton scandals and other scandals. The Hillary Clintons are the real deal in the political world. We now have the facts that Hillary Clinton was a great President ObamaCare Secretary, a good President Clinton was a great First Amendment Defense, and that Hillary Clinton lied her way into the White House.

I realize that those of you who say, ""Why can't you think for yourself? Let's see this for real,"" that you have never been in a situation like Hillary Clinton's.

And, as for those of us who know our rights and what Hillary Clinton did as President , then please do tell us. We have enough evidence to",1

I have lived in this town since I was a little kid, at a time when many other women did not know what it was like to feel love from you. One day, I was walking through the town and noticed a lady at the corner with her hands in her pockets, a smile on her face, and she pointed to a big-ass bag in her hands.

I said, ""Excuse me, lady, but who is this woman? Why is she picking my bag up?""

She paused, and said, ""Yes, you, Mr. Baker, I have been waiting here just for this!""

I laughed and said that she was right; she must have just gotten there before I did. But I never thought it would affect everyone else in town or on the street, until now. What if I wasn't supposed to hug a stranger? I decided I could not just tell someone, ""Hey, thank you for picking my bag up. I don't mean to be rude, but I know what that means to you, and I don't want to be rude to you, so I am going to give it to you.""

That was the first straw, the first time I did something completely contrary to my understanding, which I had spent a lot of money getting to know. Now that's something worth talking about… I am not even kidding. It's a big deal!

If your experience with a stranger is like this – you never felt a connection before, and you are afraid of the big blow-up because you fear that you might feel bad – you are not alone.

A big blow-up is an occasion when a woman gives a gift that could otherwise end in rejection. What would happen if a woman showed you a gift that was supposed to be hers? Would you feel bad? Would you be surprised? The answer is no!

Now, I know that some of you reading this website also feel a lot like your experiences with your partner are not typical and that it can be hard to know when to react.

Amendola wants to play on the team he signed with last summer, however, his contract expires after the 2012 season and if Washington doesn't want to pay him the $6 million that he's due this season, it might end up with a new deal. There is a possibility that the Patriots could get their man, however, as there have been reports that the Patriots would like to trade Amendola before they decide whether or not to sign him.

As reported by the New England Patriots in this article posted on SportsTalk1130.com, Amendola signed a five-year contract extension with the Patriots last week. As reported by a few of the Boston Globe's sources, the New England Patriots are in talks with the free agent receiver. Those sources mentioned that the Patriots do not view the signing of Danny Amendola as a big surprise in view of the fact that he signed a long-term contract prior to the trade of Rob Gronkowski.<|endoftext|>It turns out that people who read the words ""Darth"" and ""Tyrant"" in the same sentence were less religious.

"How America's Elections Are Hacked, Missing Link Discovered Black Box Voting, founded in 2003, performs nonpartisan investigative reporting on elections in an attempt to stop vote rigging. You may be wondering what the term “black box” means. A “black box” system is non-transparent; its functions are hidden from the public. Elections, of course, should not be black box  systems for any practical reason. Black box voting has several benefits that help to minimize both voter fraud and electoral fraud. For instance, “black box voting” would minimize the cost to vote-buying and campaign contributions for political candidates who would otherwise participate in elections, such as candidates supporting or opposing the incumbent. It would reduce the risk of voter fraud, as voter lists generated using black box voting would not contain any information on candidates and political party affiliations, unlike those generated using paper ballots.

But black boxes are not the only benefit of black box voting. The second most practical benefit is the reduction in errors. The United States is the only advanced democracy with a fixed, fixed set of voting rules. For electoral votes to be counted, each state is required to have a winner as well as the possibility to substitute alternative ballots in the event of a tie. Black boxes are an alternative to this fixed election mechanism.

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires states to meet certain qualifications before implementing their own racial quota systems. The Act states that no state can ""disproportionately affect or limit"" voting in any way without obtaining permission from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB is an independent agency of the Executive branch. It is part of the Executive branch and can impose sanctions based on discriminatory acts, particularly with regard to electoral voting.

Some states with special circumstances may be able to modify their election processes to eliminate all or some restrictions on the use of white boxes. One example of this would be Hawaii, which has never used black bars, despite having one of the few black systems in the United States. The most notable aspect of this system is that every ballot is counted regardless of whether the candidate using that ballot is white and regardless of whether the candidate on the ballot is black. With white boxes, the black bar on the ballot would be visible only when the election is conducted. But this makes it impossible to compare voting patterns by race, and it can easily be reversed if necessary. Hawaii's systems have always been used in the context of election results. If Hawaii used some forms of black boxes, then there would be a black bar on the ballot that would always give a white vote to the candidate who won and vice versa—a scenario that only happened during two elections that were very close.

Because of this, the United States has no national standard for black box voting. Some states still prohibit black boxes, for reasons other than race identification. The results are often presented from black boxes that",1

They would take photographs of the bodies of young women and then bring the bodies back to the clinic for selling. So I got the idea of creating my own story about the female body. What follows is a story that was created just after finishing up my post. I hope this piece provides some context for anyone who was touched by the story.

A few years ago, I started looking at body parts online as a hobby to see if I have some sort of connection to them. It turned out to be something of a success, it's interesting to see the evolution of the industry. However, I do believe that these types of businesses will not be sustainable. There will always be people out there for profit, who are willing to exploit victims, regardless whether they are trans, or any other kind of person. That and the fact that body parts are one of the few commodity items that will continue to exist in our society are big issues that people need to pay attention to.

Before proceeding with this story I think we should be clear about what it is that we are looking at here.. it is a short story collection. It is my hope to raise some awareness of these issue.

I did not know the body I was looking at would be in this story. I just thought body parts were part of a normal industry. All I knew was that this could be a story about a trans woman getting body parts for sale. To me, body trading was a whole other story. In the beginning it was so much worse than body-sorting but now it is still extremely disturbing for all the people that we have to deal with. But I am beginning to learn that bodies are one of the few commodity items that continue to exist in the society and that the real story will begin after some time.

I am writing this story out of love and it seems this story is not about body trading at",1

America needs a wall at our southern border and the House just passed a spending measure that funds a portion of Trump s wall!The House passed a spending measure Thursday that includes funding for a portion of President Donald Trump s border wall with a vote  of 238-189. The House is expected to pass its measure Thursday afternoon with support from Democrats.Rep. Mike Turner — who voted against the wall bill back in February — added his voice to the call to action when he posted a petition calling against this proposal.While both bills contain some additional money for the wall, they do not have enough funding for its full $14 billion price tag, according to The Hill. Turner said a wall would allow border agents to patrol the southwestern border much more efficiently and the money could go a long way to making up the difference.He also praised Senate leadership for allowing up to $1 million a month in increased spending for border security instead of making the budget cuts known to the public, the Hill reported. He also praised the Republicans and said they were pushing the White House harder than Democrats because of Trump s policies.""You know they have to stop this agenda. But you also need them to pay attention. They know we have another election year,"" Turner told The Hill.Trump's border wall with Mexico may become law as early as Thursday if a few Democrats get behind it.

""The racial composition and economic circumstances of student bodies has been increasing in recent years, so it's an appropriate time for us to recognize the important contributions of historically African-American schools to the fabric of our communities,"" Roberts said.

"WILL TRUMP PULL A “ROMNEY” In His First Debate? Says He Won’t Mention Bill’s Infidelities Unless Hillary Does This… [VIDEO] Who could forget Mitt Romney s second and third debates with Barack Obama? After the first debate, most Americans were pretty sure that Mitt had successfully exposed Barack as the amateur that he is. But something strange and unexpected happened when Mitt came back for round two. Either he was  smarter than he seemed, or people didn't get it. Now, as we wait patiently for the official debate results, this video is the first hint at what we may learn: he did not make up his position (nor even did he mention it), and Mitt actually knew, as the other candidates did not know, that he was lying.
With this release, I plan to keep investigating every single detail on every single claim made by Mitt during that debate. We already know that Romney has tried to use the ""death panel"" excuse, and more evidence is coming: a quote from someone who knows how to play the game clearly reveals how he got Mitt off the hook on the topic of jobs, specifically the fact that Romney's wife was paid $150,000 in taxpayer dollars to represent an oil company which had never been found. Also, Romney is using the term ""giant tax cut"" to describe his plan, which doesn't even cover the first $150,000 they plan to donate to charity. It's like saying they're going to cut Social Security by 8%, but giving people 2% in interest, even though the retirement fund is going to end up taking in more money than would ever be available.
Romney also repeatedly lied to the audience about the amount of money he really has, while the fact is that if there are any questions about how it could be less, it was just that he wanted them to believe it. If anything, even if it turns out that we were all idiots, it is a sign of how badly Mitt wants us (and his supporters, and his fans) to believe him.
What is even worse is the number one reason we should be angry with the Obama people, who have been so successful in portraying themselves as the better political experts, but the numbers they use are the same as the Romney guys. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it's more likely that the Obama people were just taking advantage of their audience to try to create as much drama as possible. To keep going along with this false narrative, Obama had a great way of doing this by releasing the most comprehensive and widely read campaign ads yet.
The Romney campaign has a new line: it's all a big setup. The campaign has been working so hard on putting out phony attack ads against Romney -- with a real candidate's own ads, of course, but also with these misleading or edited ads, designed to make them look like the actual Romney campaign. As with all of Obama's ads he's produced",1

" Sen. Tim Scott: Running A Small Business Makes Me An Authority On Abortion (VIDEO) The 2016 Values Voter Summit is underway, and of course this yearly gathering of homophobes, misogynists, science deniers, and other assorted right-wing nuts is especially feverish since this is an election year. At the top of the list of priorities for such people, is, of course, abortion.These people hate the  very idea of life, believe that pregnancy is an error, that babies are something to be aborted, that a woman should get her period in a hospital and suck on a syringe, and that a teenage girl who has abortions can't give a damn unless she is married to a woman.""I think God gave you this life. And we have to give you your life,"" they're saying. ""And if we don't, people will kill us in this hellhole, and you will lose the right to have any kind of life.""This is how they want everyone to think about abortion, and, of course, it really is a religion: abortion becomes a moral issue in its own right, and that's when abortionists begin to come along to save the day.It's a big part of the anti-personhood movement that believes we must overturn Roe v. Wade, as well as other landmark laws that restrict abortion rights and prevent women from terminating pregnancies. In fact, so obsessed are they with all of the horrible things Planned Parenthood allegedly does -- things like selling aborted fetuses, performing abortions on babies, and even making their own abortion machine -- you'll hardly find any anti-choice organizations out there that even speak openly about the horrors they have done.And so, they create sanctimonious speeches -- like the one by the group's chairman, Bob Vander Plaats, on the Values Voter Summit -- to argue against abortion. And, as you might expect, so does the media, claiming that they ""do not support violence against patients or facilities of public funding."" They want abortion to be legal ""if necessary,"" and are willing to use any means necessary to do so.They're making money from women's emotional attachments to children, and, of course, their own lack of moral compass. They have a deep, abiding love for the unborn child, and it's really no wonder how they make fortunes. They want women to believe that the unborn child is a part of them, and that is what they believe, despite the millions of women across America who believe otherwise.So they make a good living making millions of women feel bad about themselves, while taking the life of another human being. That's where the money comes in. It's not only how much money they make, but how they act when they are making money off of other people's emotions.So the most important part of the story has been the abortionists -- a group of religious extremists who have made millions of dollars off of the emotional attachment women may have for",1
"Trump Executive Order on Ethics Commitments Bans Lobbying for Executive Branch Employees 21st Century Wire says Reactions around the world are mixed with regards to the first salvo of executive orders coming out of the Trump White House, but here s one that will likely have many readers nodding in agreement even some reluctant agreement from the left, perhaps?On January 28th, President  Trump signed an executive order aimed at temporarily shutting down all U.S. funding to foreign countries if they do not comply with his vision to build America back up to the strength it had in 2008 and 2009.The executive order states that if the countries are found to violate America's sovereignty, they will be ""unrestricted"" funds, which means that funds from America are shut off, meaning that citizens of those countries cannot go and obtain goods or services.This means that individuals that live in these countries and those who come from the countries are essentially shut out for their income. According to Reuters. The Executive Order states ""The Executive Order directs Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to consider withdrawing funding that the United States provides to the International Religious Freedom Foundation (IRFF) based in Cairo, Egypt."" That was also said to be the purpose of the original order, however, it did in fact allow U.S. citizens to receive financial assistance through the United States, rather than the foreign funding.The executive order ends all of Iran's funding to IRFF, with the exception of the U.S. The executive order also ends all U.S. aid to the Syrian government and also the U.S. and United Kingdom's efforts to provide weapons to the Kurds fighting ISIS in Iraq. That's all in addition to funding to the UN and the UN Women's Fund.The executive order specifically states that if the American taxpayers or anyone in those countries believe the executive order is a violation of U.S. laws they will likely have their funds or goods immediately shut off. In the case at hand of Iraq, the executive order also states the U.S. should be withdrawing military aid, but the action is not mandatory. As we reported on January 25th, ""Iraqi officials told Reuters that the government is taking advantage of U.S. political shifts toward Russia and Iran to avoid paying U.S. contributions to the UN and the UN Women's Fund.""""This is very tough on business,"" says Daniel Fried, senior vice president at the U.S.-based International Chamber of Commerce. ""They've got to understand that it can no longer be ignored to try to enforce this (to block).""With all that on the line and all of the foreign funding flowing into the U.S., many fear that Iran will try to use it to gain leverage around the international sanctions. The sanctions are there, the sanctions are enforced, and people who are under international sanctions are blocked from traveling to the U.S.""These changes mean that the Iranians",1

Well, there’s reason to believe that the accessibility of cellphones isn’t purely coincidental. The thought originated with metadata and the possibilities made possible through the documentation of information that cellphones provide, through both  technology and information. So now that we know there’s a vast amount of usable data out there, why not start to use it at your own pace? There are many ways to access this information (including via mobile devices), which allows you to do something useful, or at least more useful than what you’re currently doing. There are even ways to use this information without paying for it, like sharing the information in an event like a social networking event. If you take the time to do so, it will give you more exposure and visibility, which will help the rest of the world to learn about you.


This is one way to begin creating what some call a ""culture of value"" amongst the global population. Just keep doing what you‡re doing as you progress and you will benefit the world. And while doing that you will receive more opportunities to spread knowledge and share ideas. You do not have to take the time to put in the effort. Most people don't have to put in that energy and effort to get involved in any way. But if you get involved it will pay off.

This paper presents an analysis of the distribution (or average per capita) of criminal justice expenditure from 1970 to 2009. It provides evidence that the number of cases being handled per correctional population increased by 50%, a trend that was then maintained until 2009. This increase in resource utilization may suggest that increased efficiency is driving this increase in crime. It is suggested that this trend must be reversed if criminal justice resources are to be efficiently allocated to the most crime prone populations.<|endoftext|>An anti-piracy group has warned that Hollywood giant Walt Disney may be paying pirates to take down pirated content and has called on internet service providers to prevent such behaviour",1
"Sugar Doesn’t Just Feed Cancer Cells it May Even CREATE Them by PAUL FASSA First realize that even without being diagnosed with cancer, we all have at least a few cancerous cells floating around in our “inner terrain”. A decent immune system residing in a slightly alkaline or neutral pH inner terrain is able to fend them off and keep them  in check. In contrast, an acidic or alkaline inner terrain is more sensitive to cancer and a lack of immunity. So many types of cellular and environmental toxicity and toxicity interactions are not just one-off events, but are designed to make the internal cells of all of us ""cureable"" for the vast majority of all types of cancer and illnesses. Let's get our hands dirty. The Basics of Acidification Here are the basic steps of what can happen to our outer atmosphere. Here are some of the processes that happen to a molecule's inner environment and how these affect our internal environment. First off, oxygen and hydrogen atoms must be in equilibrium (near saturation) in the inner atmosphere due to ionization. This means that oxygen atoms can flow freely in the water of the ocean, as oxygen hydrogen forms the water molecules with no resistance. Since oxygen has no hydrogen bonds, the oxygen molecule needs to be in equilibrium and has a negative charge. As the oxygen atom joins with the hydrogen atom, the neutral nucleus on the outside becomes ""inverted"" into hydrogen. In contrast, the hydrogen atom joins the oxygen atom with oxygen hydrogen and the hydrogen atom forms the two oxygen atoms to give you the hydrogen atoms, oxygen oxygen. The electrons in the hydrogen atom of the oxygen atom are held together and so have a positive charge in comparison to helium's negative charge. When these pairs of electrons move together, the neutral nucleus of the oxygen atom becomes ""inverted"" into the oxygen nucleus to create a positive negative charge on the outside. On the outside, this negative charge on the hydrogen nucleus must be added to produce a positive electric charge on the hydrogen atom to counterbalance the negativity on the surface. The electrons that get put into the negative ""inverted"" position on the oxygen atoms remain in the positive electric state and therefore continue going in the opposite direction as the hydrogen, making the hydrogen and oxygen nuclei more positive than their external environment. They may actually be negatively charged and this causes them to ""leak"" (get ""charged"") electrons into the atmosphere. They remain ""charged"" until they collide with their electrons, or even through the passage of an electron particle through them. Once they get into the atmosphere, they get more and more charged and so eventually they get neutralized. That is when the hydrogen atoms begin to get neutralized. The neutral state of the hydrogen atom can be very stable because they are so similar to the oxygen molecules that they have an almost isotopic (two-nucleation) form. That is why they",1
"Public Bullishness Towards Stocks Sees One Of The Highest 2-Week Jumps In History (King World News) From Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader: Investors are starting to thaw Individuals in the AAII survey come roaring back to the bullish camp, a mixed blessing It takes a while for rapid changes in prices to be reflected in longer-term indicators, so some of the weekly series are  starting to come through to the market – and we are seeing that here. The average return for the last 12 months has been .54% and it's been up from .40% the same time two years ago. The next year will probably be even closer to the .49% you remember to be excited about when I said the price was about to shoot up. The price is now trending even lower – and if that continues, we can expect it to decline before too long and hit the bottom again in September. When this happens, we are likely to see a big selloff in the middle or mid-day session, and even if we think the selloff is overblown, it would still be a shock. We have never seen a drop like this again. The S&P 500 closed below 4,000 in October and then began to regain ground – and there is a long way to go before this is normal on the big stage. A lot of people are watching this on CNBC or Bloomberg TV, but if this trend continues, we will see some of the stocks go back above $800 – with a lot of time to ride it out.<|endoftext|>With a new addition and updated models and pricing, we have arrived at the last year's best gaming PC. This year we've got an incredibly detailed, beautifully built model with an incredible price point, a large, powerful CPU, a great graphics card, and a decent build quality. Our build quality rating at The Verge, where we rank PCs, is the 8/10!

But while this is a good PC, there are some really impressive parts inside, too. Some of the components are really nice to look at. Others are super important because their design can lead them to a really good-looking build and a great quality of life. Those are the components we'll focus on in this review.

The components that we'll focus on:


The motherboard

We've got a fairly standard (a 9.2″ tall/long) motherboard, all-plastic front I/O that's been sealed tightly. The front shell and heatsink are plastic and very similar to the way we saw on the Asus ROG STRIX. The heatsink also has a lot of movement, so it's definitely removable once the motherboard is installed.

The CPU

This CPU is a fully unlocked design from a Chinese manufacturer with a quad-core 8400U part and up to 8GB RAM. The design has a nice flat look,",1
"TEXAS COLLEGE STUDENTS OUTRAGED: Traditional 9/11 Memorial Flag Display Moved…Could “Offend” Some Students The shocker about this is that students on both sides of the political spectrum want the 9/11 flags to be displayed where they ve always been displayed. The inability of college campuses to stand up to people who are perpetually offended is a sad statement on where we are in  this nation today.

The fact that the American flag is more beloved than the Confederate flag is also troubling. It should be retired as an internationally recognized symbol of hate. The Confederate flag has never been a symbol of hate. The only thing that would make the flag more acceptable is if a student at my church was offended because there was nothing in the Bible that said people should keep the Confederate flag on their lawn.

But now we are confronted with another reality: A new flag is required at every college and university — a flag that looks more appealing to millions of people than the Confederate flag. It is time for the United States Flag to be a symbol that is more acceptable to tens of millions of Americans than the Confederate Flag. A new flag that should show up everywhere.<|endoftext|>The last two weeks in the American soccer league's regular season were the most important of their careers. After being eliminated early from the playoffs, the Portland Timbers finally made some noise, winning 12 of their first 17 matches and ending the regular season at 3rd place in the Western Conference.

The Timbers' win over FC Dallas, an upset that took them to the quarterfinals, was enough for many to write Portland off; a loss to Minnesota United would have erased the late momentum of the late season. However, thanks to the contributions of striker Darlington Nagbe, Portland's recent victories have pushed them well beyond just the ""not very good"" group. Through 7 games, Portland is still third in the Western Conference, one goal behind Real Salt Lake and two behind Houston (one game behind LA)

Nagbe is doing everything he can to continue those successes and is just as important as many of the other stars.

One of Portland's most difficult tests comes this Saturday, when the Timbers take on Sporting Kansas City at Dick's Sporting Goods Park. The home opener between these two sides will be played after a week off between matches in the United Soccer League, a league based in Missouri. It's still early for the team to build momentum, but Nagbe and the Timbers have managed to build the confidence in themselves and in their play since getting to the quarterfinals over the span of the entire regular season.

Nagbe's ability to score goals has been the story of their last 8 games, but while the team's overall performance has not changed much, as is expected, scoring goals against these two teams could have been difficult for the Timbers.

Before Nagbe was acquired, Sporting Kansas City had never previously surrendered three",1
"The NRA Just Admitted It Was Always Lying About Obama Confiscating Guns The NRA has just s tated the obvious – that President Obama does not have the ability to confiscate guns, nor has he ever tried. This statement is an acknowledgment directly from the NRA, after years of warning their members that a Democratic president is going to take away their  firearms rights. It would be very naive for those who are not NRA members to think that the NRA is unaware of a Clinton presidency. But as everyone knows in our republic of 23 million, we do have an NRA. And in their view, President Obama's appointment of Judge Merrick Garland was going to be a major victory for the Second Amendment. So we're taking a step back and saying ""I think it is safe to say that President Trump is going to be a great president, and we welcome his victory today."" But what makes it even more ironic is that, because so much of the media was focusing on these comments – and it is ironic because the media was focused on this entire issue at one point. The entire argument was that President Obama was too strong and too authoritarian for the Supreme Court. I don't think anything he just did is going to change that. His Supreme Court nominee is somebody who is an outstanding jurist on constitutional law, and in that capacity has served on the Supreme Court for many years. One of the reasons why so many people had become outraged and upset at the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision was because there had not been any enforcement of it by the courts. And the reason was a constitutional right – the Fifth Amendment. And the Fifth Amendment is something of a nonissue in court cases, except in instances where you have a Fourth Amendment search warrant. But today, we have Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy – our current president – dissenting against that ruling. So that has always been a sticking point for the NRA. We are disappointed that Justice Kennedy would vote against the ruling of the American people. So I think we can assume that he does not like his boss. I don't think he really likes it. But so far, the only media that has reported on the issue has been Fox News, the very center of media creation, which was the origin of this whole gun control issue in the first place. And the fact that Fox News, the very center of media creation, would report on it – the only media that was paying attention has now been gone. That is a tragedy. And what President Trump did today is a tragedy in and of itself. We are going to do whatever we have to until we regain our constitutional rights because the Constitution was never meant to protect you from the government or from the courts. We are just supposed to have freedom of worship. And to talk about gun control in America is not something that we take lightly. The president, by doing what he did today yesterday, took away the",1

"BUSTED! THE MOST DAMAGING Clinton Foundation Emails Yet: “Friends of Bill” Friends of Bill Long-secret emails just caught Team Hillary in another blatant lie namely, the claim that Clinton Foundation donors got no special treatment from Clinton s State Department. In fact, ABC s case study of the 2010 Haiti-relief feeding frenzy may be the most damning foundation scoop yet.And the  big question is why all these donations from the Saudis came on top of so many Clinton Foundation donors getting paid to go on CGI conferences and sit around doing nothing for the people of Haiti? That seems to me to be a deliberate design to deceive the American people about Hillary's role in the entire affair. As the Daily Beast reported last week:But that's not all. ABC also reported yesterday:This scandal is even more damning because the State Department seems to have given the Saudis money they had no right giving.

"Tom Hayden: Things Come Around in the Mideast By Padishah , July 23, 2006 at 12:19 am Link to this comment (Unregistered commenter) I must address the complete drivel that was Mr Jeff Gershoff’s comment. First and foremost, in 2002, with the full backing of the Arab league, Saudi Arabia offered the Israeli’s a peace treaty - I  believe it included recognition of the State’s territorial integrity. They accepted and accepted, and in August 2003 they launched the attack on the UN mission in the Gaza Strip (UNMISAT). As you point out, that was immediately followed with a second air strike on the hospital in the city of Khan Tuman (I guess the hospital is now in the Shujaiya neighborhood of Haifa). I repeat, I agree that Israel's occupation has been illegal. It has resulted in the destruction of most of the homes of the Palestinian citizens of Israel and more than 120 Palestinian civilians were killed in that attack. I have been an advocate of Israel's right to exist since 2000 and I have a number of complaints regarding its conduct in Gaza and the region. But now, a peace treaty is suddenly going to be offered? What am I supposed to think of Israel's right to have an unconditional acceptance of the entire Israeli population over Gaza to create an independent state‖? The first thing that bothers me about the agreement offered by the UN is the wording they are using to talk about Gaza. They have completely changed the definition of what they mean when they talk about an independent state - in its modern sense, we would probably mean that Israel should become an independent country. In fact, what they have said is that the international community is not committed to recognize Israel's right to exist. How can we accept that when they say that UN institutions will have to recognize Israel if it is established? I don't understand what it takes to establish an independent country. I don't understand why Israel's rights have been violated - but then again, I don't understand the rest of the conflict (Israel's right to exist) either. What I do know, and what Mr Gershoff and Mr Zappala are totally ignoring, is that it is now accepted that the UN has no power to negotiate an agreement for Palestine, as we discussed. So, the only reason they are making an agreement, is because they don't trust the United States or Europe, which would never allow any nation to establish independence in such an environment. I will add that at the very least, the Arab League has told us that Israel's right to exist is being violated by whatever agreement they offer (if any, we cannot know about this). So I guess Mr Gershoff is correct. The Arab League is making an agreement for Israel based on their position on Israel's right to exist. And if you agree with this, Mr Zappala, then you should also realize",1
" WATCH: Trump Declares Himself One Of The Best Presidents In History With Historic Low Approval Rating Seriously, this actually just happened.Prior to a round table ass-kissing contest, Donald Trump told a room full of reporters and his Cabinet members that he has passed more legislation than any other president except Franklin D. Roosevelt. I will say that never has there been a president with few exceptions,  who has passed legislation in the same amount of time as his predecessors, who has passed legislation in as much amount of time. There have been a couple of presidents since Franklin, but never has anyone done it so smoothly and consistently. And it's not just legislation either, in addition to this president, this team has more achievements than anyone, of any president, the last 11 years. What Donald Trump has done is nothing short of incredible.""Trump is the first president in modern history who has created a job to replace an old job,"" said Rep. Brian J.

""No one else has this job. He will have this big and important job. He'll go out and he'll say he can get things done. That's what every president does. He's the man.""The president's record is full of accomplishments, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2016, when he completed a historic first term with an unprecedented level of popularity. Goodlatte and others lauded the president's actions to repeal and replace Obamacare, protect Americans from the Ebola outbreak that has killed over 4,500 since Jan. 15, 2014, and cut taxes for the middle class and for students. Goodlatte and others also praised the tax reform effort, and he said he is confident this White House will remain that way even after the president leaves office, if necessary.""I believe if Donald Trump wants to make good on the promises made to us, that he'll have to deal with the consequences of some of the things he's done,"" Goodlatte said at a forum on Capitol Hill. ""And he's going to have to deal with the consequences of some of the things he's not doing.""At the same forum Goodlatte praised the efforts of Trump and others to make progress on trade, immigration and energy.""We need to keep moving forward and we're going to keep doing that regardless of what the president decides to do,"" Goodlatte said.

"ILLEGAL INVASION CONTINUES: NYC RAMPING UP TO GIVE 1 MILLION ILLEGALS VOTING RIGHTS Insane! This really is the definition of insanity.

Now that Obama has taken over the White House I get to sit down with the mayor to explain that he still wants to make it harder for people to vote, in a way that doesn't make it harder to vote, so they can vote three times on an issue like health care. If this all made sense before, I would've told him it was so wrong. But Obama did make a promise to bring about a new era of electoral reform and that's what he's done.

For some reason, when I first started playing these deck archetypes in Modern Masters 2015 I just barely noticed their presence. I was not impressed by them at all, but I thought they might be something interesting to try out once I knew how to manage my cards. The answer? Well, since that time I have kept track of them in a similar way.

For those who may not know me, I play Magic on the weekends at Modern Masters events and have the pleasure of having friends and playing opponents that happen to be on their local MTGO team. On these events the metagame has changed a lot, but the big questions remained the same. To start with the format as a whole; does it continue to remain stable? And then the question of 'How does it impact the meta?'

To get you started on that, I've written a small piece explaining some core things about the current metagame and where things stand against those with a fair amount of experience. For completeness, I've included the current metagame share figures, which are calculated based on recent data collected through various sources.

While the current meta is generally similar to last week (although the percentage of decks is quite low by today's standards), players continue to try and innovate.

As I said in the previous part, when it comes to testing, this seems like a good one. There is little to no expectation of getting the perfect 75%. Players don't get too discouraged by it, and I can honestly say it doesn't even detract from the quality",1
"Re: The Hard Working American vs. The Government Parasite The Hard Working American vs. The Government Parasite By Michael Snyder, on April 10th, 2012 Which lifestyle choice produces better results – being a hard working American or being a government parasite? Actually, when you look at the cold, hard numbers they may just surprise you. In America today, we  work less, consume more, and live longer than our ancestors – but we still live in the United States of America and not India or the UK or China; or Italy or Austria or Iceland or Japan and not the United Kingdom.

American success is determined by your ability to stay safe at school. That's because there are fewer and fewer schools in the United States these days. In fact the most popular college level American education is in engineering and physics. Our schools are in high pressure zones and the schools need a lot of security and training to operate effectively. The only exceptions to this are for government-subsidized universities and high schools – where there is no safety net, there will be no student mobility and fewer opportunities for advancement. America is becoming more like Denmark and to a lesser extent Germany than the country where we grew up – but more like Japan. But what about your chances for success in the workforce? Of course, it's difficult to find exactly how smart people are, but an astonishingly large number of people are employed in the workforce and earn very good salaries. Of course, if we want to make sure we put enough money into the education system that we can get as many good people as possible into the jobs we need then we need to have a minimum wage where everyone can expect to make, or be paid for doing basic work. In other words, if the US were not so heavily dependent on foreign labor then we'd have some serious problems with income inequality and inequality of opportunity. What then happens if a majority of the country is unable to get by on minimum-wage jobs? It's likely that this is what happened to Mexico after it joined the WTO. This is when Mexicans who had jobs were simply deported, not given the opportunity to re-enter the country without having paid their wages again. In other words, by working hard and being smart the Mexican workers were able to provide enough of a stable income to help support their families. The same thing can happen with America. The percentage of Americans who don't want to pay Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid has fallen substantially from its peak during the 1950s, and is likely to fall further in the years to come. Yet we have no national health care system to offer the workers who are eligible. This leads me to the final point. When your government takes away your right to vote, it's easy to think you are an independent or an independent citizen only with rights, like you deserve freedom of speech and freedom of expression. But in practice, such freedom is nothing",1

Trump told the news media on Saturday: ""If you look at a piece of paper and see something written that is very, very false and it was written from a very, very high level, it's the opposite of what we're talking about today."" He went on to point out that the piece of paper was printed in an area that the Secret Service did not inspect. But if the person that printed the fake paper was Jewish, they would have arrested and fired him. So they don't have to search the person. They just print the fake paper and get away with it. This is exactly how Hitler was able to print fake German newspapers just as effectively.

Trump went on to say ""I think there is one major problem in dealing with the Israeli state. The people they keep from reaching their right to self-determination in the territories that we're supposed to let them own, it's the Arabs who carry it out for them. The Arabs have been throwing rocks; they've been throwing stones at homes. And that's a different problem than the people that are going around writing those reports that I mentioned.""

Trump also continued his criticism of Hillary by saying that she is ""sick and tired of being treated so unfairly"" by the media and by Hillary's enemies: ""She's weak on crime. She likes guns. She loves, I believe, money. I think many people would suggest that she's not really up to the job.""

The next morning at the White House press briefing, which is normally a private affair, Trump did not go for the usual White House press conference routine, but used it to deliver his usual attacks on Hillary Clinton. His main complaint against her is that she ""spins out like a chicken in a pot pie."" He noted, ""She doesn't even seem to know how to spin for 30 seconds, and then she goes, 'Well, she spun this spin for 30 seconds.' She's spineless.""

After making several personal attacks against Clinton, and accusing her of being ""out of touch,"" Trump went on to",1
"You Can't Be Intersectional While at the Same Time Being Elitist and Exclusionary By Djuan Wash / filmsforaction.org One cannot claim to be intersectional while at the same time being elitist and exclusionary. Everyone isn't hip to what heteronormativity, heterosexism, cisgendered, cissexism or many new-age terms mean. You can't write people off for not being where you are or prescribing to your beliefs. 

No. But if you take a step back and consider who they are and what they believe is going on or how they think things should be then why are you arguing against their right to be represented? Isn't that about it?

You're not actually advocating to stop being represented so what's stopping you from just ignoring them. They'd most likely go straight if you didn't.

The bill's proponents are hoping that a connected device will give people more power and privacy in their everyday lives .

""We are the first in the world to mandate a smartwatch, and it is our hope and expectation that this legislation will encourage other governments around the world as they consider the introduction of legislation targeting all of Government, civil society and non-profit organizations,"" David Dayen, co-founder and CEO of Wearable Intelligence, told Wired in a statement. The device would be used to track and make inferences of the wearer's health—the latest of many potential medical uses for the technology .

The wearable technology could also offer even more personal privacy if it's worn by citizens in a secure manner. ""If they can't access all the information on their wrist, people may be less willing to keep track,"" Dayen says .

For the time being the government seems to want a law that's similar, if not just copied, from other laws (see: "" What Every Health App You'll Ever Need to Know About Your Medical History ,"" IEEE Spectrum ); which are already passed. ""They have a bill and have the authority to implement a law. I think that they are doing that, because it is the right thing to do. And my expectation is that it will continue. Because there are many similar initiatives around the world,"" Dayen told Wired.

Dayen told the magazine that the device's purpose is ""informative."" ""The thing is that every device and every piece of technology is always being used in some way to aid in diagnosis and treatment. This is not some fancy tool but a more advanced piece of equipment that will tell you more about you and what disease your body is in or what drugs can help you heal. They will",1

A man who admitted killing a couple and setting a house on fire in 2014 has been jailed.

Stephen Russell, 27, of High Hill Street, Blackhill, pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

Russell, of High Street, Blackhill, admitted set them alight at 2.40pm on 13 October 2014.

He was jailed for 20 years.

Russell is also prohibited from using firearms.

He served 18 months probation with supervision.

Posted in Emergency Services<|endoftext|>A day after an Indiana college student took a fake ID from a cashier at a grocery store and hid it inside the cupcake he ordered, the state called on local officials and a social media campaign to make amends.

Kyle McNeil, a sophomore at the University of Cincinnati, had just bought a bagel Wednesday when he heard someone asking on social media to pay for it. When he heard about the tip, in which an old friend of McNeil's had said he could buy it, he said, ""What's the worst kind of a prank?""

He was in no position to offer any advice so he ordered something else. But the customer he'd ordered the bagel from did.

He later came running to his dorm room, crying, saying he'd forgotten to bring his old IDs.

On Thursday afternoon, when the state's consumer protection bureau said it had opened a investigation to see if McNeil's behavior violated federal laws, the University of Cincinnati sent a letter to the vice president for human resources, saying he should leave ""as soon as possible.''

McNeil said he was glad that the student found comfort, and said it was ""not the first time she had caused me pain"" through the incident.

The student was charged with misdemeanor trespassing and placed on temporary probation for up to 90 days. The Department of Human Services also placed her in the state's no-bail zone, or locked room, for up to 90 days.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Indiana, which investigated the incident, would not say what McNeil said after purchasing the bagel.

McNeil has since deleted the Twitter photo of his bagel but didn't delete the Facebook page on which it was posted. He said he's not sure why, but thought it would be hard for him to keep it hidden.

""I'll say something because I still haven't had any contact with (his sister), and honestly I just wanted to just leave it in case she asked what it was,'' McNeil said.

McNeil said the student told his mother and his brother they didn't buy and left it there. McNeil hasn't heard back from either.

One customer, who also didn't want to be identified, gave McNeil some advice about why it's okay to buy fake IDs.

""I think it's kind of like being in someone's pants, like,",1

Turns out he s confused over what Ossoff was selling Matthews said about Ossoff: I don t know what the hell he was selling. He wasn t selling much. Ossoff  is an African-American who was a congressional candidate in Georgia. That tingled Matthews was the reason he thought the media s a group that doesn t write stories that s good for us, right? The truth is, though, it s not what he s talking about.

When asked whether he was confused about the Ossoff s election efforts, a mama boomer told Matthews, ""Well, I mean Jon Ossoff has never run a big ad in this country that has been really well known on social platforms like Twitter and Instagram,"" Matthews replied: Well, when you have some liberal billionaire who is not running for office trying to get elected this race is very confusing."" A few weeks later Matthews was on MSNBC s Meet The Press on June 23, where he was asked if he had a tingle. Matthews seemed to take it well.

I took my clothes off, walked around my beach to use a toilet – I don t know what I did – in a tent. The last time I went out was a week ago in the same camp. We had gone on a walking holiday together, but I took off my clothes at breakfast and the tent was pitch black – in a tent, we were naked.

The man I was living with said that I looked too good to get wet and I was always covered in sweat because I got in the sea every morning, had a headache from sweating and my clothes were always wet. In those days I did not know what to think. My brother had to walk five kilometres with me because he could not walk. It was a difficult time for him. We got the same food on this one camping trip. We were starving.

"THE FUTURE BELONGS To AI And Whoever Masters It First Will Rule The World While all eyes are on North Korea and Melania s stilettos RT Competition for superiority in Artificial Intelligence at national level will most likely cause World War Three, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has said, warning that an AI may deem first use its best chance of winning. China, Russia, soon  the US and India too will face competition. Elon Musk has said that it is likely that China may use AI on mobile phones within the years and that Russia is thinking about this and is also considering this potential for future tech as well. Speaking on RT, the billionaire noted that China will have ""the technological capability of getting 10 times the processing power than the United States, or 100 times the processing power than America. We have the advantage of being able to be incredibly cheap about hardware, because you can run whatever you need on your phone if you know you can build them at home – all the electronics in a phone is not cost prohibitive."" Musk also mentioned that it will take some time before AI actually develops the ability to create new ""art"" – that will be a big problem. If a robot can create an entire city from scratch or build an apartment entirely from scratch, you know things are pretty advanced. A robot would only need to understand certain patterns, and then it would just be doing it on a computer that knows about buildings, roads, buildings, roads, roads! You cannot expect that to happen because you can't even design a building by hand.

Elon Musk has stated that it is likely that China may use AI on mobile phones within the years and that Russia is considering this and is also considering this potential for future tech as well. Elon Musk has also warned that it will be extremely difficult to bring robotics to the global market without creating more artificial intelligence itself. Russia would only sell hardware through private companies, which requires extensive infrastructure to support human labour on site. ""The most difficult technological challenge is that technology is so unpredictable."" Musk is also speaking of the fact that robots are not always the smartest thing in the world. ""If robots were to learn to know your habits they are actually still learning.""

One thing you do need to understand is that there are no ""AI-level"" machines coming to you anytime soon. It may not take you that long to get rid of the human race, but it may not be quick. This technology is not going to happen by itself… It will take years of research – over 20 years of research into different fields, in different countries, for a single machine, such as a Google car, to actually become more of a machine when it comes to understanding human behaviour. That kind of work could mean years and even decades of being ""learned to think"" to be more, rather than a simple automaton that will look and act just like every other automated car. One",1

During a panel discussion on Wednesday's “Anderson Cooper 360,” Republican strategist and CNN regular Ana Navarro went off on Newt  Gingrich, claiming he was not ""the real deal"" and that his ""self-help"" talking points were ""too self-help.""

She continued: ""You never really know what Gingrich is talking about until you talk about him because he's completely off of reality."" After her statement was interrupted by Cooper, Navarro was not satisfied, tweeting the following on Wednesday, “CNN Big Bang‬: ""Gingrich is a phony who wants to divide and rule.""​

The tweet drew immediate reaction from many online and from others on social media. YouTuber The_Turtle responded to Navarro's comments with a video accusing Gingrich of being a ""moron,"" the latter remark being based on Navarro's claim that Gingrich ""came to Washington for the money"" and that he ""wanted to divide and rule.""

The league made some great strides, both offensively and defensively, and has added plenty of talent, such as a top four in scoring and points scored. But some observers suggest the 2015-16 season could have been much more successful had more focus been placed on the underlying talent on the ice rather than on the personalities on the rink.

The New York Rangers and New Jersey Devils have a lot of history in the past. Both teams were founded in 1799 by brothers John and John C. Bingham, two great New Yorkers whose families are tied to the Jersey Shore region of New Jersey. Both teams hail from the New York metro area, one of the fastest-growing communities in the city.

While there has been some talk of the possibility of expanding to more areas, and maybe even bringing some professional sports franchises to New Jersey, fans there have generally remained wary of the idea. ""We are extremely disappointed in the decision, but our thoughts will be with the player involved,"" John Hart, executive director of the New Jersey Devils said in a statement.

John C. Bingham, Jr. and his brother John Bingham of the Boston Bruins were the only players who ever held both first and second jerseys.

With this potential move having failed to generate significant interest, it was unclear why fans didn't want this particular franchise to join the NHL.

A fan from the Long Island town of South Plainfield, Mass., wrote to the New Jersey Devils asking if they'd consider bringing the Rangers back home.

""I just want to hear from you because you are definitely a contender but I guess don't know much about hockey fans as the fans from South Plainfield in my area of Mass. always turn their backs on any major team and they would be a real loss in New Jersey if your team did leave,"" the fan posted to Facebook.

J.D. King pleaded guilty to the murder on June 1 after posting messages on Facebook that included derogatory language against the Canadian federal parliament, according to court documents.

The sentencing hearing was initially set before the same judge in Calgary, but was rescheduled for Thursday.

""You can't help it. I know what you are talking about,"" one post by King says.

""You think you are the boss. You have just killed your boss, and the next one is coming,"" a Facebook message says, using an expletives as a noun.

The following day, on Wednesday, June 7, King posted a YouTube video in which he expressed remorse for the killing.

""I just want to apologize for doing what I did. I'm not proud to have killed him. But I realize things got out of hand. I'm not proud to have committed that act of violence, and now I understand what I do have a record of and I know who I am,"" King says in the three-minute video, which was posted four days after the fatal shooting.

On Friday, a jury found him guilty of the murder and sentenced him to life in prison, a decision the judge rejected on Wednesday.

On Monday, King's cousin and sister of the victim gave King's side of the sentencing hearing in Edmonton by video conference from prison.

""We've got some bad news from the court on justice for our Canadian cousin. Judge Douglas, can you please let him be,"" said Christine King, who attended the hearing.

"OBAMA RACES TO SET GITMO TERRORISTS FREE…Leaves Servicemen Punished For Making “Heat-of-the-battle decisions that saved lives” In Fort Leavenworth It s hard to imagine a President who could be more anti-American and more pro-terror than Barack Hussein Obama. And then my mind drifts to Hillary and Benghazi The Obama administration is emptying the military s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of avowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but  Obama has sent a steady stream of soldiers and contractors to these wars since he took office. As I mentioned, more American personnel have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan than in any combat operation since Vietnam. That means over time, more Americans will die in these wars, as well. One of the hardest, but least known, aspects of this war has been that the American military cannot keep up with the pace of the fighting . That has led directly to the deaths of American soldiers.

President Obama has made the decision to withdraw the entire combat role from Afghanistan, but the United States will keep the troops, equipment, and trainers there to combat terror and keep U.S. cities safe . That is why every time there is a tragedy, every military officer says this is what we are fighting.

If that war continues, and if we lose more Americans from Iraq and Syria or die, then it will mean that a President who supports terrorism and who is the world's top killer will become President of the United States.

This is what we are doing and we need to get rid of it.

It s time to end the War on Terror that is killing our citizens in an endless cycle of needless terrorism and endless wars. No more.

There is no better time than the present for all the citizens of this nation to come together and to reject that enemy that seeks to destroy our way of life, and our way of freedom, and destroy the American way of life.

It s time to declare war.

It s time for us patriots to go to war.

It s time for our military to be deployed everywhere and everywhere.

And it s time to end the War on Terror that will kill our soldiers and families, and will destroy the lives of millions of Americans, especially the young men and women who have done nothing but serve in the military.

Trump's surge is the stuff of history, and the poll results suggest there is no stopping Trump as he moves from one campaign trail to another. That's the good news. The bad news is that his supporters know that not everything is going to work out for them. While Trump is still enjoying a significant lead in popular and electoral college votes, Democrats aren't much better at convincing their supporters that their candidate is right for the job ahead. This poll of 1,023 registered voters finds a vast majority don't feel like they'll be able to convince Trump (58 percent) or Hillary Clinton (45 percent) that he will actually keep his promise to ""drain the swamp"" and ""make America great again."" And in the state and national polls where a majority of voters approve of the president, those results are even worse: only 21 percent of non-Trump voters say ""they think Trump can make progress and move the country forward."" If you're not convinced, here's another poll , done before the 2016 election, which shows nearly half of the voters saying they plan to vote for the incumbent -- even though they disapprove of Trump. And here's how the nation has come to hate its president.
You know the rest. As the months slip away and the Trump Effect festers, he's going to continue to win. And now, for the good news. As of Thursday morning, Trump's approval rating is at 60 percent. That's not bad. And it's better than it has been in some time, including in his first term when it was underwater at just 36 percent, and as recently as August. That's not good either. And what you see in this national poll is clearly a very real problem for Democrats who have tried to blame their loss on Trump supporters. What's that mean for the future? The bad news is that, while the president's popular vote performance has been largely consistent with his campaign rhetoric, they have not been consistent with Republican success in some key states or national elections in the past. And in this new national poll, a full 18 percent of people said they expected the GOP to defeat Hillary Clinton even with their candidate leading by as much as 5 percentage points in the popular vote. While this may be cause for concern, those figures would be the kind that most Republican presidents have enjoyed during their entire presidencies. We're at the point now where Republicans face",1
"PETITION TO STOP GEORGE SOROS VOTING MACHINES HITS 100K posted by Eddie A White House petition to remove Soros-owned electronic voting machines has passed the 100k votes necessary for a response. Will America finally stand up to global elite rigging our elections? The U.K.-based company Smartmatic has sent voting machines to important battleground states across the US including Colorado,  Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. Smartmatic makes many of the voting machines used in elections. They are now operating in New Hampshire and Iowa and will be moving across the country in the next couple weeks. Many states such as Iowa, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington have not sent any voting machines to Smartmatic to use in their elections. Here is the email sent to Smartmatic's customer's asking them if they would like to be contacted personally or in writing. This is just the beginning of a multi-state effort to remove global elite-owned electronic voting machines on election day. There will finally be a chance for the nation's political leaders to take action on this. These machines are not just an embarrassment to the American people -- they are an embarrassment to our democracy. These electronic voting machines violate the constitutional right of voters in every single state to have a voice on the results of their elections. This includes the right to vote by mail ballot (MVP), and the right to vote by mail ballots in every single state by the tens of thousands. These ballots and our votes are already being stolen, fraudulently and illegally taken every single election day by the elite. Even if we could convince the Supreme Court to overturn these voting machines, the only way we will stop the theft of our democracy will be if the elite have a change of heart. With the millions of people voting overseas, Americans will only be able to have a voice by voting in their own backyards and towns. This is why it is so crucial that the people in Washington and D.C. speak out in defense of these voting machines. The U.S. has the highest voter turnout of any nation on earth. There is a huge need to protect our democracy from global elite rigging and that's why many nations need to take action. We should take proactive steps to educate our elected officials, especially their secretaries of state, and make them aware. These voting machines can only be used to steal votes from the American people if there are multiple global elite rigging schemes operating around the world so it is important for us to educate our own government. And we Americans need to take aggressive action in defense of these voting machines.<|endoftext|>Benedict Cumberbatch in ""Sherlock.""

" Stephen Colbert Explains The Horrifying Future Of The GOP Primary Race (VIDEO) With only three clowns left in GOP clown car, Republicans are doing everything they can to prevent Donald Trump from winning the Republican presidential nomination. During a segment on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert hilariously mocks Trump s victory tantrum and explains the only two ways to stop Trump from  becoming president: First, vote for Ted Cruz, second, vote for Marco Rubio. Colbert also explained that if Trump gets his way (and he already has), he will keep going on his merry way—until the people he's trying to woo realize that they have been bought and paid for.

After getting Colbert started on the topic of Republicans wishing they had picked up Mitt Romney in last night's election, the host introduced host Chris Matthews by saying that he ""can't help but think"" that Donald Trump might just be ""The Donald Trump Show,"" and he would definitely listen to the candidate—which the comedian joked would ""never happen to me in any other way.""

""I just thought I'd start to get on Colbert,"" Colbert said, then joked that he'd ""wish that Donald Trump got up and left because I'd never know, because it would definitely get a laugh.""

Colbert was then introduced as a ""conservative conservative conservative conservative conservative"" Republican.

Colbert concluded his intro by introducing a few of the more interesting people he had been following in the campaign. ""What's your favorite presidential slogan?"" he asked.

""What's your greatest fear?"" Colbert said. ""I'm not even afraid of being President, I'm afraid of being President being boring.""

""So, maybe I'm just a Republican too?"" ""How do conservative Republicans get along with liberal conservatives?""

""What's going on in the White House this winter?"" asks Colbert. Colbert then mentioned that he wanted to make his first major speech on the subject during the upcoming Democratic debate on Friday and concluded to the crowd of his new supporters: I promise they'll be there.<|endoftext|>Hollywood: In an exclusive interview with The Times of India, the head of the Maharashtra government's department of culture, Nandin Chhoti, revealed details of the government's plans for tackling the problem in the state's biggest cinema.

The Senate's top Democrat, Harry Reid (D-NV), has said he will work to repeal the healthcare law. This is a remarkable decision on the part of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). It means Reid cannot afford to lose the support of Republicans. Now, that's quite an accomplishment for Mitch. What's remarkable is the timing and how well-timed this move is. The Senate is just past the five-month mark of Obamacare—four and a half years since the law was signed into law.

At first, McConnell's leadership team seemed to be caught by surprise regarding the Senate's impending vote. On Dec. 1, McConnell said, ""'We can see how it will play out' on an issue as important as health care, it's a one-time announcement that hasn't had much effect."" But, over the course of January, McConnell's aides became increasingly convinced that their leadership had made the right decision, as Reid and other members of the party's right wing began openly criticizing the law. And McConnell's top aide, Mike Shields, told McClatchy news partner Politico, ""This is going to be a test for the Republican Party.""

What happened next was dramatic. In early January, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) accused ""the Obama administration"" of trying to manipulate the Senate. A day before, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) accused the Senate of ""being hijacked."" (Rand Paul, in a series of statements to reporters, pointed out that the Senate had an ""audit committee"" created in 2010.) The Senate's Republican majority, on the other hand, seemed content to ignore Cruz's accusations without directly engaging. That is, they seemed content to say it was up to Reid or even McConnell to make the call. Instead, they held up Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a member of the Senate's right wing, for his refusal—so hard and so close—to vote in favor of any repeal.

" Richest Man In The World Puts Trump In His Place On Donating To Charity Bill Gates is the richest man in the world. Unlike Donald Trump, there has been independent verification of his net worth, which is currently estimated to be about $76 billion. Also unlike Trump, Gates made his money by selling actual products to people and not on the sort of smoke-and-mirrors  corporate marketing that we're used to seeing so the rest of humanity should just know.

In fact, Gates was also a major supporter of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. But Gates wasn't merely a good business partner — he was a powerful leader as well

When it comes to money, most major tech entrepreneurs have little need to sell things, but Gates proved they were more than worth it.

The biggest business failures today are likely to be related to ""fake news."" What we've seen this year is a number of websites that promote fake news. In October alone, for instance, there were at least eight cases of social media sites making it out to be true that people like Hillary Clinton were not ""hanging out"" with Bill and Michelle's children. But that was only half of a larger problem. And the real problem is more serious: fake news itself.

Just how pervasive is fake news content online? Google, for one, has found.

And what's even more insidious is when ""Fake News"" becomes part of our normal conversation — as opposed to something we need to keep talking about — we often ignore it. To illustrate how important this is, let's explore how our culture gets caught up in and misuses social media:

It's easy to tell people who are really good at their jobs. They speak more eloquently than those at the bottom.

You might never know this online, but your favorite artist, your favorite athlete, and your biggest fan have much more influence over you in online interactions if you do not pay attention. We talk to celebrities in social media because, in these days of social media, celebrities have power of millions. And that power makes it difficult for us to simply ignore their words.

Here are five reasons why:

1. The truth stays out of politics

As you might expect, the more people see the negative consequences of what they write and tweet about, the more it starts to look bad for their careers, and the less likely they'll speak up for what's right.

You've probably seen the video of Bill Cosby walking by and shouting ""hallelujah"" repeatedly in his public persona. But that's far less threatening to your career if ""hallelujah"" has become a generic, meaningless rallying cry for political causes.

The real harm comes from ""not being political."" In their ""The New York Times"" piece about Donald Trump's new book, ""I Love the Country",1
"ABC NEWS: Hillary Swore Under Oath Not To Accept $$$ From Foreign Donors [Video] The video below is a great snapshot of what was going on with the Clinton foundation and huge donors from all over the world. Hillary treated the State Department like an arm of The Clinton Foundation , and it was a massive conflict of interest to our current administration to have those donors. This is truly sad!""

The State Department said in March that it believed ""the Secretary's personal and non-official actions, which are inconsistent with accepted rules of conduct,"" may violate law.<|endoftext|>In August, I had the pleasure of spending some time on our campus with former Governor Bill Clinton and other top people who helped the nation and our world get where it is now, in the form of the Clinton Foundation.

We learned new lessons about how we should build our economies in this country, and then worked on a project to reduce malaria for children. Bill was in charge of that for 10 years. He also led our national efforts to eradicate HIV from our country. He's an innovator in many ways.

The last few days have been full of great conversations among our alumni, community leaders, and staff, all of whom have put their talents and personal values to work for the benefit of this country.

But that's not all: We've also become stronger — we're doing business together every day — thanks primarily to the support of donors like you who keep helping bring the Clinton Foundation to a better place every day. Now all we have to do is ask the money that's come to the foundation to stay.

What's in your gift?

What We Do

On behalf of the Clinton Foundation

For the past 12 years, hundreds of millions of dollars have flowed to our organizations all across the U.S. And, if you don't know what a donor is, consider giving us a helping hand on our road to reform.

The Clinton Foundation has expanded exponentially for the past few years as the result of the hard work of our board members, our board chair, and hundreds of others in high places at the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and others.

So we want you to know our commitment to you: Your donations have helped transform the lives of 2.5 million people across 180 countries, including thousands of U.S. citizens today, who have made a major impact on our world through the Clinton Foundation.

For example, we work with over 6,000 schools to provide education-specific training to help develop girls and women, promote literacy, and promote peace, in some of the most war-torn countries on Earth.

We also help hundreds of universities worldwide reach their full potential by funding promising medical research from orphan",1
"BLACK FEMALE RAPPER Endorses Trump: “Black Folks Have Been Voting Democrat For Last 70 Years And We Don’t Have Shit To Show For It…Hillary Treats Us Like ‘PETS'” We may not agree with MOST of what rapper Azalea Banks has to say, but she is a fierce defender of free speech and as such, has come out with a flurry of in-your-face tweets to the black, typically Democrat voters, announcing her supporting Donald Trump. Donald Trump can add  another ten years of political humiliation to his tenure in the White House by threatening to fire all of his appointees to federal jobs. ""My job will be to enforce the law, uphold the constitution. I don't care if I offend someone,"" she told MSNBC at the end and while other celebrities were too busy tweeting their opinion, there was nothing like it on television for the black, usually Democratic voters. (Just one, however, did tweet about the President making himself the center of a firestorm of racist attacks, including one that appeared to blame Clinton for the death of Trayvon Martin — a racially charged comment that garnered more than a billion views on YouTube, but only made the rounds to die off because of the time it took to air on network news.)

In another interview, the rap artist was asked to react to a statement about why the American people should vote for Hillary Clinton on Friday. She responded with a long rant to say how angry she was with all her black and brown peers saying they were wasting their time worrying about things like ""this stupid election thing?"" While some others, especially black voters, were not amused by her tirade as well, the rapper was certainly happy to see more black politicians come out and support Hillary.<|endoftext|>You've likely heard the term ""Halloween"" thrown around, but which Halloween is the most iconic?

At the end of the day, this is all a matter of preference, and while everyone likes having an epic Halloween, there are certain elements that can best be found in the traditional ""Spooktacular"" series.


While the traditional Halloween theme is usually based on a traditional holiday or a specific creature, the different styles can sometimes overlap with each other based on the nature of the celebration. For example, Halloween could be celebrated by people for Halloween Eve, while Halloween could be celebrated by people for Halloween night, Christmas Eve, and even a celebration celebrating people's love of Christmas! You might also enjoy a Halloween-themed date night or a festive holiday party that celebrates something that's already on your life, while having another holiday that falls on the same holiday is something that you wouldn't necessarily want to try. You're also free to do a Halloween party your own way.

But regardless of the Halloween tradition, which holiday should you prefer to celebrate? Who says you have to live in the shadows or into the light? How can you celebrate the most popular holiday in all of Halloween with just about any costume and with just about any food?

" Bannon Allies: Breitbart Return Imminent, Gear Up For War On Trump’s ‘Democrat White House’ Prior to being on Donald Trump s campaign, and later his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon ran Breitbart news. That particular internet news outlet is known for its promotion of racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, and other various forms of overt bigotry. They have also always been huge Trump supporters. However, that  changed a bit under Bannon, when Breitbart launched a controversial piece entitled ""Why American Women Shouldn't Date Immigrants,"" in early September of 2016.

Now, a number of commentators have argued that Breitbart's decision to pull the piece down is because Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulous ""wasn't going to allow the alt-right [sic] [sic] to co-opt his ideas in a way that would be acceptable to the alt-right.""

As of Monday morning, Breitbart posted a note to their Twitter account to announce they ""did pull the article that was intended to expose [Trump's] racism and sexism.""

We didn't know what the implications would be when we pulled it, so we just let you know to 'like' it so you can see how this came together. — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) July 10, 2016

""We didn't know what the implications would be when we pulled it, so we just let you know to 'like' it so you can see how this came together,"" the post notes. ""Many thanks to the thousands of readers who have so generously backed us in this undertaking.""

Breitbart has an interesting relationship with Trump on the internet. At one time, they were openly pushing for him to run, although it later fell through. Since that time, Breitbart has become increasingly involved in the Trump war to promote his candidacy.

Breitbart has also been critical of Trump in the past, making accusations about him and his campaign, as well as criticizing him over his response to the 2016 terror attacks. Since his election, however, much of their reporting has taken on a more neutral tone with regard to Trump, and they have appeared to be taking a closer stance on the future role of Breitbart.

Breitbart CEO David Hacks tweeted out a statement that did appear to be in response to the story, however, and did highlight Trump's past anti-Semitism and white supremacy.

The world's first quantum computer could become the world's most powerful computer by one day if its creator could find a way of harnessing the quantum physics of superconducting magnets to store images and symbols encoded in complex mathematical algorithms.

For more than a decade, scientists and engineers based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) – known as the 'Harvard of the quantum world' – have tried to get one to work, in parts. But to date, the process has involved creating supercooled qubits, which can only operate in a vacuum, relying on what quantum physicists call information entanglement, in which one of the qubits carries an entangled state, or set of entangled states, with the other in a superposition of those entangled states.

But, according to a new paper authored by MIT researchers, a much simpler method that harnesses quantum physics – called the superposition state approach – could help solve one of the big practical problems that has vexed the creation of highly accurate quantum computers. The paper is set to appear in the October 8 edition of Physical Review Letters.

""Superconductors are made of tiny, very tiny, superconductor grains,"" says Prof Simon Kuebler, a professor in MIT's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and lead author of the study. ""There are these tiny grains of superconducting material, like these grains on the outside of an eggshell. So with each qubit there is always some information with which to carry forward, say what the grain is going to make, say what sort of data it is carrying back.

""It seems that we might be able to extract information from these superconducting particles using quantum interference methods, in much the same way that we extract information from atomic nuclei from certain atomic clusters, or from the electrical current.""

If you ve been following the children of Trump on the campaign trail then you know they re smart and very business savvy.Trump moved away  from his usual style of golf tournaments, a change that was clearly a calculated choice to appeal to conservative voters. It was an attempt to avoid the perception that he was too soft on Russia and China, two issues Trump had previously accused of hacking.Trump's children, Donald Jr and Ivanka Trump, will assume the office on Friday as part of the transition of power, ending President Barack Obama's six-year term in January.According to a report by the Washington Post, the president will meet with all cabinet officials on Friday to discuss the transition from business and politics.

We're ready to do everything in our power,"" her mother told the judge during an evidentiary hearing in a recent case in which the U.S. Air Force tried to seize data from two companies it said stored U.S. citizens' information on its computers.

Judge Joseph D. Stolaroff allowed the defense to seek a permanent restraining order that would keep the information confidential, but prohibited the government from searching the computers and seizing any copies of it. On Wednesday, the judge granted the government's request, saying that although the government could use that order to shut down the case, the government had an obligation to search the servers and take any evidence if there was any reason to think it could be used against anyone.

But Stolaroff allowed it to continue because he was concerned about violating a court order prohibiting the Government from taking the information into custody unless and until a trial could be held, according to transcripts of the hearing obtained by Bloomberg News under the Freedom of Information Act.

After a brief explanation of how the judge determined that there was a need to take those orders into account, the government lawyers began arguing that there was no problem in the case.

" See Who Sarah Palin Just Compared Donald Trump To – It Will Make You Queasy (IMAGE) Seldom in life do you come across someone so dumb that they literally make you cringe, but alas, Sarah Palin is one of those people. And if her general presence doesn t make you cringe then hearing her speak will, but if that still doesn t do it to you,  watch this, because she truly is the most dumb thing you've ever heard.

As reported by the Huffington Post, Palin made a speech to a group of evangelical pastors that was aired via video conference on Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2013. That day was the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, and it wasn't exactly a smooth ride.

[vimeo q_file=1160509956]

What was the meaning of her speech? In other words:

""My father, the first president to step foot into Philadelphia, said 'if I did not have a nation from which I could see the world, I would have had to build mine on sand.' He saw the world with his eyes as the Bible speaks it: 'For behold, I saw the Father, and he gave me up for an inheritance,' says the book of Daniel. What a difference a couple of centuries make! For my family, the Lord says in Matthew 25:38, we had to come out of Egypt to establish our new covenant. But we came out because of what he said about all of us being born free and equal.'""

[vimeo q_file=1131339583]

So, in other words, she doesn't know basic geography. She doesn't know where Georgia ends and South Carolina begins. She doesn't even know the latitude of Kentucky!

Then again, most of the other world is pretty much filled with silly things, the majority of which aren't that big of a deal, such as this tweet from the president:

It's not just the Bible, it's also the Constitution, according to Palin, and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution — Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) December 29, 2013

It's not even something to get up and go celebrate, but rather a statement of an important issue like the Second Amendment or the right or wrong of gun ownership.

Palin is apparently quite offended by the fact that she made comments that her own daughter made during her speech — and that daughter is not Palin's own daughter — but here's a clip from the first presidential debate last night:

She also has to deal with a lot of foreign leaders with whom she has had to work. There was her talk about the need to find common ground with India following the deadly terror attacks in Mumbai.

" Bernie Sanders Releases Scathing Statement On Rick Snyder Over The Flint Water Crisis On Saturday, Bernie Sanders released a much-anticipated statement on Michigan s governor Rick Snyder and the Flint water crisis. In the statement, Sanders calls for Snyder to resign. There are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint s water. He did nothing. As a result,  thousands of children in Flint are living without any water. The state of Michigan should provide Flint an additional $100 million in emergency aid.

On Saturday, the Michigan legislature passed a $60 million debt-relief package. It will allow the state to make payments on bonds it already issued and it will allow the government to use that money toward relief for Flint residents. This is the sort of plan we need. As Michigan Governor Snyder said in February when he spoke before the joint committee on tax cuts: ""No state can afford to let one child die in the family from lead poisoning alone. I am thankful for everyone who has been affected by the crisis ... we are going to do everything we can to put the people of Michigan in a stronger position to deal with the financial challenges facing this state in the future.""

On Sunday, the American Federation of Teachers announced it would take a leadership role in Flint. The union is in the midst of fighting to stop the city from filing for bankruptcy because of their continued funding cuts and a lack of funding for Flint, their primary service. They're fighting to hold the state of Michigan to a higher standard for reform and accountability.

And on Friday, an Ohio woman who had been diagnosed as gay by her doctors was honored at the NAACP National Leadership Conference with a statue of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, which includes a plaque honoring the NAACP's support for equal rights and acceptance.

It all is a reminder of how far we have to go.

As the people of Flint continue to deal with the Flint water crisis, I ask, as the governor has stated, we must act. I ask for your help. I ask that I know that your vote today can and will make the difference in preventing a similar tragedy from happening again.

I know that your voice will help lead the fight on the steps where we can all work and share information. As I've always said, America is a nation of dreams, not of people trapped in a closet, and to stand in that closet is to lose touch with reality on the inside. I know that your vote today is a vote for justice. I ask that you honor the values that made America our first country so wonderful and that we can come together to show it can live up to our best ideals.

Finally, I want to say something to our Republican colleagues on the House side, because I think if you don't, I don't want to do so. I know that on this, we can all",1

""They don't know what they've lost. They can't even tell you how much they'd rather not know. I can't imagine how much of this is just a matter of being scared and confused; and the other way is that we get into a kind of dark space. It's hard for children to do their civic role. I think my biggest fear is we're going to end up with a country that is like the world we know; that no matter what happens -- whether we win or lose or how it plays out -- a country that looks like, basically, Germany today.""

A suicide bomber has killed at least 12 people after attacking a Shia mosque in Pakistan's second-largest city of Lahore, police say.

""We believe at least 12 people died and hundreds were wounded in the attack on Sunday evening,"" the provincial police chief confirmed.

The suspected attacker, named as Qari Hussain, had left a suicide belt hidden underground while travelling on a motorcycle to the mosque, he said.

The city is a stronghold of Pakistan's Shia Muslim movement, which has largely avoided sectarian violence in the wake of the killing of a Shia cleric last year.

The latest suicide attack came just two days after a suicide bomber attacked a Shia mosque in Sialkot, and five days after a blast at an Afghan compound in the North Waziri areas of Karachi.

Local reports say two suicide bombers blew themselves up in two separate attacks at the two sites.

One suicide bomber detonated his explosive device inside a restaurant before continuing his journey and then detonated near a bus carrying worshippers, injuring three Shia pilgrims, police said.

Another bomber then blew himself up outside the mosque as they were going across a bridge after leaving the mosque, a police statement said.

The other attacker tried to enter another mosque, but security guards stopped him after an exchange of gunfire with armed men, it said.

Three suicide bombers blew themselves up at the same time at the busy market, while three others went inside a restaurant nearby, it said.

Local media identified the suicide bomber as a man dressed in a",1
"CETA Is Step towards a Corporate Land Called Euramerica 3 Shares 2 0 0 1 The signing of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement with Canada (CETA) on the 30th of October marks the beginning of North America's annexation of Europe. The negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors. For over 751 deputies in the European Parliament,  representing almost 40 million citizens, there is only one candidate: Jean-Marc Ayrault, leader of the Left Front in France. During the debate he stated that he would vote in favour of Canada joining the European Union (EU), only for the French government to reject this, as it should ""not be part of a European project"". In his case, the right of an ethnic group to become part of another group is the same as having to give up your own identity. This was the moment that the European continent decided to remove racism from the list of political objectives and to protect the dignity of every human being. The European Central Bank is currently in debate as to whether to maintain its funding during the period of a collapse in financial markets. It is interesting to note that the bank was founded in 1914 in Zurich, Switzerland; the country with the largest concentration of white inhabitants in Switzerland at a mere 10%. There are over 1 million white Swiss citizens, but only one person of the 5 million inhabitants of the whole of German Switzerland has his name on the bank note. To avoid further prejudice, this issue is being discussed in the parliamentary debates of all European countries which consider immigration to be a crime. If elected to office, Mr Jean-Marc Ayrault will serve two three-year terms, the longest in the European Parliament. However, this is a temporary measure (except for the fact that France is a French-speaking country) to protect him from becoming president of both France and Belgium. After all, if he is elected by these other countries to the European Parliament, the consequences will not be negative. On 26 May 2017, France received 537 applications for political office, representing almost 4 million people. The number of applications has doubled since January 2017. The number of applications rose to 3,450 on 29 May 2017, according to the National Statistics Office (INSEE). The official statistics show that on a country-by-country basis, France received 1,215,539 applications, compared to 703,566 applications in January 2018. The French authorities did not make any progress in fulfilling the 1,200,000 applications that would have been required under existing laws (the ""civic reform law""). The authorities did not have the authority to address the problem of unemployment. In addition, while France received a majority of the political applications, some other countries in Europe are making gains in their efforts to cope. The largest European country to suffer from jobless conditions is Spain, which has lost an average of 5,872 people per",1
"PA RESTAURANT Forced To CLOSE After ICE Sweep Nabs Illegal Workers…Attorney For Illegals Has UNBELIEVABLE Response The Attorney representing the illegal aliens who were arrested alleges that, Other than drunken driving, and driving without a license, and entering the country illegally, they ve done nothing wrong LOL! The popular Aroma Buffet & Grill in York, Pennsylvania reopened Wednesday after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweep that  began this week in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland. It reopened on Friday.

When ICE agents stopped someone with an illegal alien in his truck, they suspected the man of being intoxicated, the Associated Press reports.

When they asked to search him and his illegal truck, the man resisted in part, but authorities arrested him inside.

""He stated that he had been drinking in the truck, and that he then left the vehicle because he felt that it was unsafe,"" the Associated Press said, and that the man is being held for questioning.

ICE officials told the Los Angeles Times that the department's enforcement targets immigrants who pose a threat to national interest, or ""impose a substantial risk of a serious physical impact or injury to the national security and public safety"", The Daily Mail reports. [Image by Alex Wong/Getty Images]

Immigration experts are worried that this could serve as a template for future raids. In a May report, the Justice Accountability Project found that immigrants who had a criminal record, who had an outstanding warrant, or had been released on bond for a crime were almost four times more likely to be targeted for additional detention when they were placed under detention by authorities.

An ICE official told the LA Times:

""We know that if you arrest someone for a minor traffic offense, you want them put in a more detention facility. If you arrest somebody for a felony, you may want them taken to court for a lengthy trial that can stretch on for months and months. We're not talking about a misdemeanor here.""

ICE officials told the Washington Post that they are aware of the issue of those released on bond, but aren't targeting them for detention because they would be released in less than a year and they are ""preferring"" to concentrate those who have already been arrested for non-violent offenses, according to the Washington Post.

""That's a problem for them. If they're a repeat offender for any kind of crime, like a gun crime or other minor traffic offense, we would focus that offender as close to a repeat offender as possible,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson recently told the Post. ""[Immigrants] should not continue to commit these crimes out in the open.""

A Justice Department memo obtained by Reuters cites the need to protect Americans' constitutional rights in the name of fighting ""sanctuary cities."" Under the bill, cities and states will be able to withhold from federal authorities any immigration officials are requested by immigration agencies.

"U2 SUDDENLY CANCELS Huge St. Louis Concert Tonight…Why Bono’s Decision To “Cut and Run” Makes Him Look Like Ridiculous Hypocrite In 2016, celebrities came together to create an emotional video that minimized crimes committed or incidents that led to the death of black men and women, both young and old, across America. One of those celebrities was U2 s lead singer, Bono.For many, Bono s part in the video was  as significant as his part in the song, which he wrote by way of a poem. This was, as U2 s manager explained, the first song that Bono sang in the song in which he spoke about racism in America.The video of the song's lyrics was the work of the music video director, who has since said that the song was written as a series of pieces to communicate the same message of hope that Bono was trying to convey to a community that had just found hope in the hope of change. His aim was to encourage them to find the good in their community, not despair.And indeed, U2 was successful in its desire to communicate hope through their video. It has now become a global anthem on the internet, even though it won't be heard any time soon.In the aftermath this year of this year's police shooting of Eric Garner, who was killed in Staten Island, Garner's mother Erica Garner became a household name because her son died in the line of duty and became part of the nationwide movement to raise awareness about systemic police brutality, especially in America. While her son died as a result of what many called a racist policy by officials, his mother was able to raise awareness for her son and his memory by speaking with the media. Her speech was also applauded by U2 s lead singer.Now, with the deaths of these two young Black men, as a result of what appears to be a pattern of racist practices in this country, our hearts are still broken, although we are proud of what we still have to offer our community in this difficult time.We continue to work with U2 , who's music in this time of unrest has become one of the most poignant pieces of music and art to come from this year. This song will always remain one of the most iconic moments in this era, and as a legacy, both black music and black people are likely to be touched by it for decades to come.The message of hope is still an integral part of the message that we carry in our song; we want to believe what the police and officials have said, but we want to believe in what they're doing to protect or protect against, and if it's the latter, we're going to hold on.We continue to believe that we've won this war against racism and fear, and we love our country for it. Our love for the United States and its people will always be stronger when it seems like we stand with those who are already feeling that way.We are the generation of hope.",1
" Hillary Clinton’s Real Record On LGBT Rights Hillary Clinton is a complicated woman running in a country that wants its political platforms to fit on a trucker s cap. As a candidate, she has taken a lot of heat from progressives for being late to coming around to marriage equality. She was, but it s not that  late. Her decision to leave the issue largely unmentioned on the campaign trail, leaving the public wondering if she will come around from her position regarding it.

When her husband's support for same-sex marriage came up in April 2011, her position changed so much that in June of that year, she even came out for it. But it wasn't until the Republican convention that she finally gave up her support for marriage equality and came out in favor of a constitutional amendment to overturn that choice. But she never endorsed Amendment One, her only endorsement of the movement.

In a press release, New York State Senator Daniel Squadron offered this:

In New York state, marriage equality was adopted by state voters in 2008. In the 2014 election, our state leaders have passed a marriage equality ballot initiative.

This is the same Senator Squadron who came out in defense of his mother's marriage in 2011.

It s not that late for her position, either. From 2010 to 2013, the state legislature voted to remove the right of same-sex spouses to marry from its constitution. At the end of 2014, then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo made an even broader move on this front, putting a three-year ban on same-sex marriage, meaning that there is only now, according to an April 13 article in the Los Angeles Times, two years between the date New York became the third state to have made same-sex marriage legal. As a result, over the past 24 years gay couples across the country, many of them in same-sex couples, now face losing their legal rights. (You can read all about the other state-level same-sex marriage bans that Cuomo has signed in California, Vermont, Oregon, and Mississippi here.)

But the Democrats in the state legislature had long been aware of the move that same-sex couples had to make to get married. The Times article goes on to mention the political impact this had on Sen. Squadron:

If New York voters are concerned that it would be unfair for same-sex couples to face discrimination in getting married, that's because they are. For the first time in state human rights history, a person of the same gender can't be declared legally married in New York State. For a couple seeking legally married recognition, that means that marriage will be unavailable.

On this note, while Senator Squadron has publicly come out on this issue before — most recently in January 2013 — he actually announced this just one month before the passage of same-sex",1

The MTA just announced that riders will be able to ride free at all of its stations — or, with a ""bundle payment,"" save money and enjoy a free ride.

That sounds nice. But that's only if you get off at all of them and don't use the bus. The MTA is planning to roll its pilot program out across the boroughs beginning Oct. 2, according to the New York City Daily News.

The MTA announced Thursday that the free ride will begin in the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island starting September 15. The MTA is looking to expand this free ride concept to other boroughs, as well as to more bus routes in the future. Riders will receive vouchers that will be redeemable for one ride, with each ride providing free rides to up to two places.

But the agency would not detail when the free rides will happen or when they will take place. On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city's transit authority is expanding its free ride program, adding additional routes to a program that is already open across the nation. While the MTA says it is committed to expanding its program, it declined to name the additional routes.<|endoftext|>I thought about buying a cheap, overpriced, crappy computer just so I could use it for video gaming, and even then I'm no good.

Here we highlight the difference between this misleading terminology and reality. Fluoride is the component in certain common household water supplies commonly used as a solvent to dissolve dissolved water; the term is also used for chemical impurities which may be found in chemicals used in cosmetics, cleaning products, and other industrial products where the chemical is inorganic. There are numerous other natural and non-chemical chemicals present in household water supplies, which are responsible for fluorosis. Fluoride is added to water supplies and processed in certain products to reduce the amount of dissolved solids present to the water body, which in turn helps maintain pH balance. While other ingredients can reduce the amount of fluoridated solids in the water for individuals with kidney failure, individuals with otherwise normal kidney function will experience a lower level of fluorosal fluoride content at the source than in general population. Although individuals in low fluoridated fluoride areas may have a risk of lower kidney function, the risk of developing fluorosis and other health defects increases substantially once you add fluoride to the water supply.<|endoftext|>WASHINGTON—The Justice Department is warning residents in nine states that it could file suit and possibly get them fined if they fail to disclose the existence of a ""federal warrant.""

The warning follows reports that police in several states had used drones to look for suspects, but have not been aware of the Department of Homeland Security's requirement for warrantless searches of people's home with a drone. The department told reporters Wednesday that in a few instances where drones have been used, the department has not determined if there was a warrant.

The Department of Homeland Security's warrant requirement is meant to prevent the military from searching homes without a warrant, often with little or no probable cause. But the provision applies only to law enforcement. In other cases, federal agencies and police have been asked to create ""pre-established"" warrants that require less specific search provisions, including an affidavit stating that the individual suspected of a crime has been identified or that the search would be conducted without an imminent threat of bodily injury and that an arrest will be made without unreasonable delay.

In July 2004, Bill Maher sat down at an airport hangar and began an interview with a man named Sam. The subject, Sam, was from the small town of South Dakota, a state that had voted overwhelmingly for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and, in 2012, had gone for Hillary Clinton. He was, in the words of Maher, ""a bit of a Democrat, but not as much as I probably should have been.""

Then Sam started telling Bill about his journey through college and the high school that had helped him land a job at the New York Daily News. ""No one would tell me why I was smart and not poor,"" he recalled. ""I came to know them through my teachers."" Sam's response was startling. ""Why should I know that?""

For Sam, the news was his life's work. And in part why college has become his primary source of information. He's spent the past eight years at the Wall Street Journal, where he's covered all aspects of the financial world as a veteran newspaper reporter and co-editor-at-large. He also covers news at various media outlets like BuzzFeed and Politico and, in 2007, wrote about his own struggles in journalism school. His new book of that experience is called The Way Back.

Since then, Sam has worked at newspapers like The Washington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Times of London, but in 2006, he found himself at Newsweek. A year after graduating from the school, the Wall Street Journal was planning on taking him back to Chicago.

Sam, an American citizen and resident of California, arrived in Chicago to work as a regional sales manager at the magazine. He says the newsroom was chaotic, but in addition to being a work-a-day routine, there's a place for Sam in the media. ""As a matter of fact, I think the culture war was kind of an ideal situation. You can sit around until 11 p.m. and then come home and go to sleep at 3 a.m.,"" he says. ""And I was not going to miss an evening of coverage.""

For years, Sam worked with staffers at his job. ""I worked at one desk where a lot of people were working on stories, and",1
" Trump’s Voter Fraud ‘Expert’ Just DISPROVED His Own Voter Fraud Argument In The Most Ironic Way Possible Ah, Trump and voter fraud. The subject that he can t let go because, on his warped planet, he s so beloved by everyone that there s no way he lost the popular vote. Donald Trump is just not a loser in any way, shape or form. So why is  it up in his face after being trounced by the media? Because everyone knows that he s a loser. But this is the same Donald Trump who, on Election Night, was still bragging about rigging the result and the electoral college in favor of his campaign.

On December 19th, 2016, the next day, Trump held a press conference in which he falsely claimed that millions of people voted illegally that day, in violation of federal law. He also tweeted that election fraud took place across the United States, and that the election, ""was fixed."" At a rally on January 16th in Pennsylvania—""a long awaited victory,"" he said—he claimed to have heard from ""local and state police"" who reported that, in one town, voting machines had been ""abused."" Then, that same afternoon, Trump repeated some of the same things, on Fox News' Sean Hannity Show (""the one thing you can say with certainty is that the election was rigged"") and on his website (""I mean, you don't lose an election by hacking, you lose an election by hacking like they say in Russia""). The media failed to investigate these allegations, because they were so blatant that any reporter who tried to investigate would be branded a liar who engaged in ""voter suppression""—a term which Trump uses casually to describe his political opponents and which he used a couple of times in a tweet and on MSNBC in February. The media also failed to investigate the evidence, since Trump's campaign did, in fact, release statements on Monday claiming that Russian foreign officials had stolen votes from Hillary Clinton. The Washington Post investigated them; their conclusions were inconclusive.

But the media's inability to probe Trump's claims is indicative of one thing: that his lies, for all their contradictions, are the most popular form of political discourse in America. ""It's not our job as reporters to debunk a joke when it lands with a laugher against one candidate or another, or to put some salt, any salt, in the wound when Trump does something outrageous,"" the former editor of The Wall Street Journal, Donald Graham, once said. That is a perfectly valid line to take, especially in a country that claims to honor freedom of speech. Trump, however, is neither comedy nor a joke.

The medical examiner determined his cause of death to be ""cardiac arrest induced by hyperoxia in subacute cardiac arrest.""

The tragedy has been horrifically reported since; it has caused countless headlines to air about how one can die from such a scenario, and it's become a hot topic on social media. One comment posted on a popular website after Sirota's death reads:

Sirota died because he had ""cardiac arrest induced by hyperoxia in subacute cardiac arrest,"" he was in distress, had been struggling with chest pains and his oxygen tank exploded. The only reason he was alive to do this is because he had an oxygen mask to breathe. He was rushed to the hospital where they injected him with more Oxygen.

As of press time, two doctors and one paramedic have been fired for not reporting Sirota's death as a possible heart attack. (The medical examiner has since recommended this in the event that any of them had had any prior warning about how dangerous it could possibly be.)

But don't worry, because some people in the blogosphere who want to prove themselves to people with no knowledge of resuscitation are trying to get them to think it's okay to kill you if you have a heart attack while you're in the middle of a marathon. It's such a bad law that not everybody can run a marathon, so a lot of people take matters into their own hands and try to make this a death penalty offense for anyone who believes it's okay to kill you while exercising.

Here's the thing — you can absolutely use your life to the detriment of your heart, which is an absolutely horrible thing to do, but you can make sure that the whole world knows it's OK to kill you in order to be more likely to exercise and to increase your chances of a heart attack occurring next time you do it.

The first thing you need to know is that there are a few different rules that exist when it comes to exercising when a heart attack is an option in the event of someone else dying while you do so. Here are just a few of the rules you need to follow during cardiac arrest to minimize the amount of pain and blood loss that the heart can produce:

"CNN’s Don Lemon Tries to Downplay Horrific ‘Anti-Trump’ Torture of Mentally Disabled Man In case you missed it, CNN anchor Don Lemon went on a drunk, alcohol-fuelled tear this past New Years Eve, drinking tequila shots during CNN s nationally televised show.

The incident prompted him to delete Twitter and stop responding to Twitter messages.

Lemon's story was only a tip of the iceberg in a string of alcohol-related arrests in the United States over the past year. On December 1 of last year, 27-year-old Andrew Williams of Michigan was arrested for DUI and driving while his license was revoked. And the week before that, 50 years ago today, 32 year-old William Buford of the United Kingdom was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay a hefty fine. All of Johnson's alcohol-related arrests were related to drinking.

Lemons DUI arrest was only the tip of the iceberg

On September 25 of last year, 51 year old Mark Johnson was arrested for driving while his license was revoked. He was driving with a suspended license and, reportedly, too many liquor.

Johnson's arrest came as a shock to many. This was, after all, CNN's most famous anchor who covered the worst events in the American news calendar. The show has the biggest ratings in the company and, since its launch in 1992, hosts the likes of John Lewis, Hillary Clinton and David Letterman, among others.

One of the other most celebrated anchors on CNN is Anderson Cooper- who recently became a celebrity with his show.

He also hosted the reality show Master of None in 2016- and, to be fair, he's made very little money since joining the series. In 2014, he made just $12,000 which came out to a monthly income of around $350. Anderson Cooper had an average daily income of more than $50,000 between 2013 and 2014.

We have all heard of the concept of ""the British pound."" This is in honor of the U.K's founding father, David Attenborough, who coined the name ""pound."" He was born in the early 1800s in the tiny Welsh town of Wrexham. At the age of 10, he began his career with the Royal Air Force, becoming an F-4's pilot.

But the British pound was much more than just the name and it grew very quickly. In 1875 Attenborough wrote a piece titled, ""The Balfour Declaration: A Brief Exposition of the Great Subject,"" titled to honor British Queen Victoria and Queen Victoria herself.

"WATCH KARMA IN ACTION: CNN GETS HIT With Tear Gas While Defending Violent Alt-Left Protesters At AZ Trump Rally The timing couldn t have been better. Just as Gary Tuckman, a reporter for Very Fake News CNN, was in the middle of a hit piece on President Trump, he was literally hit with tear gas being used by law enforcement to keep the radical Alt-Left protesters from harming innocent  people in Ferguson.

Tucker Carlson, despite making multiple threats and even giving Trump a hard time over his comments about ""both sides,"" was forced to cancel the show due to the police.

It is quite ironic of course, that the mainstream media, which openly allows its members to take money from foreign governments in order to advance their agenda of destroying America and its people, is currently being used by the government to try to destroy what is right here in America.

What can you do?

If you follow what happens in the world, you will have a lot of people following you and your actions, but you will have people questioning you. You will have people who ask, ""What else can I do to protect myself?"" or ""Where are my guns?"" or, ""Is Gary Tuckman going to be held accountable for his actions?""

As much as it pains me to say this, if you really want to be part of the solution to dealing with this massive crisis in our country, you first have to do something. If you want to truly help your country, that is up to you. What Gary Tuckman did isn't right, and what he said must be taken out of context to get a full picture, and then he and his fellow conservatives will have to go through what he went through to try to make it seem like it wasn't right.

But if we keep going down the same path, you will have a lot of other people going down the same route, doing what we haven't done and making the same mistakes that Gary Tuckman did.

When the United States of America began, there were only six states. Since 1876 there has been 21 states, a major change in geography and history, but the founding fathers have not forgotten all the places that have been called home to us. Since the founding of the United States there has been an extraordinary amount of activity being performed here at home. In fact, the U.S. Census Bureau recently added more metropolitan areas to its official list of census metropolitan areas (CMAs).

"Hillaryous! Huckabee Compares Clintons to THESE Famous Mobsters. Hillaryous! Huckabee Compares Clintons to THESE Famous Mobsters. Posted at 4:11 pm on October 29, 2016 by Evie L. The Clintons, much like a mob family, have managed to avoid being caught or held accountable for any of its many, serious wrongdoings — except there’s another infamous mob family who  has a connection to the Clintons, even though none has yet been brought to trial. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has had some of the highest praise for his role as Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign manager, was also named as having worked in the infamous Veneto-based Mafia family for about 10 years. In the 1990s, Giuliani was running for mayor of New York, which required him to have been a member of ""the Mob."" According to his memoir, My Last Day in Politics, a former classmate of his named Donald Murck — who would become one of the masterminds behind organized crime in New York before Giuliani was elected mayor — was also working for New York's Veneto-based Mafia clans. Giuliani claimed in the book that he ""knew all about the Venetian mob in New York. I was the liaison between the Venetians, the Gambino crime families, the Calabrian crime family, and the mob."" One of Giuliani's early roles was with his friend and business partner, Paul Bulger, who was eventually found guilty of orchestrating the mass rape and murder of prostitutes in 1981 at the height of the infamous ""Black Friday"" shopping scam. Though Giuliani's association with the Venetians ended somewhat in 1993, he continues to be credited with helping make Veneto an important player in New York City's gambling industry and facilitating a ""gambling tax"" that would allow local businesses to charge a fee on all gambling gaming revenues as well as provide tax breaks to certain casino operators in the city with the proceeds from the casinos' profits. As a senator, Giuliani worked alongside then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daszelne to write the Veneto Mafia law that made Veneto part of New York's financial industry, as well as work with then-Secretary of Labor Steven Mnuchin to pass a landmark bill mandating a minimum wage. According to the Manhattan district attorney who prosecuted Giuliani and his brother in 1993, Rudy Giuliani's mafia connections ""made his work with the mafia possible."" According to the New York Times in 2012, after Giuliani was elected mayor, he continued serving as his campaign manager for several months after his first year in office for ""security reasons."" On his first day in office as a New York City councilman, Giuliani announced he would be the ""manager of the campaign"" as he began his first term – a position similar to the role that then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg held in his run for mayor. After his second term was over, Giuliani became head of New York City's Immigration Department",1
"Clear heart blockages with this powerful lemon and garlic mixture Clear heart blockages with this powerful lemon and garlic mixture Amy Goodrich Tags: cholesterol , heart blockages , natural remedies (NaturalNews) When your coronary arteries narrow, they fail to supply the heart with enough oxygen-rich blood. At first, this may result in chest pain and shortness of breath. However, when  the arteries fail to dilate in the area around your heart or fill up with blood, that is what they do: they narrow. This causes a heart attack -- one that doctors expect will kill you. So why do patients get these heart attacks? What causes these coronary artery narrowing results? The heart is made up of the clots, which are the clotting cells in our bodies. In my opinion, the heart blockage occurs because, due to this failure of the blockage, they have a hard time providing oxygen-rich blood. However, these blocked arteries only take up about 10 percent of the blood pumped into our blood vessels and can only produce blood to the heart when they are properly blocked. Once they become blocked, the body does not produce enough blood in the normal manner, therefore blocking them causes the heart to beat much faster and more slowly than normal. When the heart becomes blocked with this heart condition, there are a number of factors that may give you heartburn. For many people it affects the arteries. For example, when a person has coronary artery blockage, the blood supply from these areas to the heart decreases. As a result, the heart can become more congested and it can no longer pump adequate amounts of blood. A person with heartburn may feel dizzy, faint and feel nauseous from chest pain. When heartburn can be caused by any cause, you should see your doctor immediately. If you think you have heartburn, be sure to contact your heart doctor right away! A heart rhythm disturbance can result in a blocked artery that can cause severe heart problems. However, the most common heart blockage is caused accidentally through lack of attention to heart health and diet. While diet, exercise, and the diet used in conjunction with your diet and exercise should go hand in hand, some patients feel guilty about it. People who have heartburn feel guilty about eating unhealthy foods. This can happen because they think that they have to. They feel guilty if they know more about heart disease and how to avoid it.

The Heart Is Made Up of Many Blood Channels Many of your blood vessels will be responsible for supplying your body with oxygen (which your body can't do in the way, for these reasons, the heart and blood vessels fill up and the blood vessels become blocked). Your heart arteries in particular are made up of two types of blood-filled tubes, one within the heart, and one between the heart and the lungs. In the case of the blood between the heart and the lungs, there are",1

Some state lawmakers claim the law could save lives.

The ""universal background check"" law was inspired by two other deadly shootings in Connecticut in December 2011, which resulted in the deaths of 20 children attending a Sandy Hook Elementary School. Connecticut already has an agreement to conduct background checks for all those buying guns; gun manufacturers will also need to conduct extensive checks. But the law has caused problems for states like Rhode Island whose laws vary.

If it does not clear the Rhode Island Constitution, the gun-purchase law could be challenged in federal court, something the Justice Department has called ""a matter deserving of serious scrutiny.""

At the start of the legislative session, state Democratic leader Jim Kenney, told me that he wanted to make sure that the law passed. ""There were some concerns that the new laws are going to limit the Second Amendment,"" he told me a few weeks ago. ""They can't do that.""

The ""universal background check"" law was inspired by two other deadly shootings in Connecticut in December 2011, which resulted in the deaths of 20 children attending a Sandy Hook Elementary School.

But the laws themselves have not gone far enough. In the days since the first case had surfaced, Connecticut police have discovered 3,959 guns that could be traced back to the same guns that had been sold on the federally-regulated National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)--the database that checks each and every gun sale in the U.S.

The gun-control groups that pushed for the universal background check act--and which ultimately helped get it passed--had hoped this provision would take away the incentive for law",1
" Veteran Newsman Ted Koppel Scorches O’Reilly: You Spent 20 Years Making The News Dumber (VIDEO) Legendary ABC News reporter Ted Koppel has seen a lot of change in the way news is covered during his lifetime and clearly not all of it is good.In a fiery interview with Fox News pundit Bill O Reilly, Koppel turned the tables and laid out a scathing indictment on  the way ABC News covers its news. Here is what he had to say about the way it covered the Benghazi attacks and the aftermath when it was covering the story.


O'REILLY: But you say your reporters actually knew what they were talking about. Why didn't they cover it like you did? KOPPEL: Well, I know some of the reporters, and I've spoken with them, and this is why they've come up in the questions I've been getting. They weren't covering stuff for you to read about. They knew what they were doing.


And as a matter of fact, here's the thing. We are not talking about some kind of secret cabal of reporters who wanted to try to shut you up. They know what's going on and they were doing it. The ABC News correspondents knew exactly what they were talking about. That's all they were doing. O'REILLY: So you have these people inside the networks and you're going for your readers without anyone inside the networks -- you go with your sources.


KOPPEL: That's absolutely right. It's not up to me, Bill, to tell those reporters what to write or what kind of stories to tell. We're going to let the reporters tell the story. And they had an interest in the story, but they did it for a great story and some great people. All I can say is they had no part in putting it together, nor were the people who did the job in this or, indeed, did any of them in general.


O'REILLY: So they knew there was war in Libya? KOPPEL: They knew, and they knew what was going on, but they were doing it, which was to investigate Libya's first and only president, Muammar Gaddafi, because they said was going on in their reporting. And that's what this story in Benghazi tells.


O'REILLY: So when you say you have people inside the networks -- there was this guy out of the country, he was telling stories like this -- ""These are the truth,"" the CIA went out -- O'REILLY: They're going to cover that up. These are the guys out of the country.

The survey included a question on food supply standards for children between two and five, but also asked food consumption patterns for people who are 65 years and older. The most recent survey results suggested British children enjoy greater taste and nutrition than their American peers.

""Food is now so easy, easy enough that many young people can enjoy it without ever needing extra help,"" said John Stewart, the chairman of FSA, in a statement. ""They enjoy eating delicious and healthy British foods.""

According to the latest survey findings from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, the national food standards organisation) the UK saw an impressive increase in food consumption among young people in 2013 and 2014 – from 5.9% of total consumption in 2013 to 6.3% in 2014. This was mostly attributed to improvements in food supply standards, according to NICE.

In the UK, over the past five years, the percentage of children between the ages of two and five who ate at least 10 pints of food a day has increased from 15% to 20%, according to the NICE 2013 Food Consumption Survey for Children, Youth and Adults (CDYSQ2). It also reported that between 2000 and 2011, the number of children between the ages of between seven and 22 who ate at least five pints of food a day increased, from 4.3% to 9.8%.

NICE also found that children have increased their physical activity levels, with over 1.6 billion children between 15 to 22 year old in the UK exercising. The NHS also has a significant need for a healthier workforce. Of all adults aged 65 and over in England aged 60 to 89 the UK now has the lowest proportion of young adults working than any other",1
" ‘Family Values’ Republicans Introduce A Bill That Would Make Sex With Lobbyists A ‘Gift’ You have to love the Republican party. They call themselves the party of family values. They hold themselves to a higher moral standard. They think they are spiritually superior because they statistically go to church more often than Democrats. All of those things, however, are underscored by the one thing  that Democrats can't stand: the word ""family.""

What is the Republican term? In short, Family Business.

Republicans, of course, see marriage as a contract. So this means you have to love your wife or you'll be an unhappy person. All other words fall into that category.

What they lack on understanding is ""marriage."" They are not taught that marriage is just a simple contract between two people. When you put the word ""marriage"" into a dictionary, what do you find? An American dictionary definition for ""Marry.""

So let's start with ""Husband and Wife."" The American Heritage Dictionary for the English Language, Fourth Edition (2nd Ed.) defines marriage as ""a legal union between a man and a woman, the legal basis of family."" And if you look at that definition, you see that it includes a parent-children, a spouse-widow, or perhaps spouses-grandchildren. This is a marriage between a man and a woman. A marriage with two men. An American dictionary definition of marriage. But as soon as you say ""wife-husband,"" the definition of marriage changes.

They don't hear it; they hear ""wife."" And there is no family of marriage with two wives.

On the bright side, the American Heritage Dictionary is not a translation of what's in the Bible. But if the Republican party continues to deny the sacred nature of marriage and the dignity of marriage — no matter the number of wives, no matter the number of children and no matter what the rules that govern marriage — my guess is that the party will lose to Republicans.

The Republican party is not like any other political party. So, I would just love to know: what does a Christian conservative think of a conservative party?<|endoftext|>The Department of State's Consular Section serves in a number of ways with the U.S. Government.

The NHL has been under pressure to boost season tickets sales in recent years amid the recession and the recession in the United States.

The NHL said last week that it has received requests for proposals on the 2014-15 season sales from multiple sports, including hockey.

This report does not include new additions to the league in the past several years.

The NHL has previously forecast annual ticket sales for 2013-14 to be about $1.2 billion. It was last published in June 2013 when it predicted that 2012-13 season sales would be about $1.27 billion and in 2011-12 it said that annual season ticket sales were projected to be about $1.03 billion, but there were several large market fluctuations between that estimate and the actual numbers generated by ticket agents.

In 2012-13 the league announced that it was not planning to increase home team attendance with a focus on selling season tickets.

As for those reports from last year, the NHL said it would not be responding to them given that it was a ""prospective change to the format.""

""We are not currently in a position to answer your letter regarding a potential change. The format changes could impact a number of factors,",1
"KKK GRAND DRAGON Endorses Hillary Clinton…Who’s The Racist Now? [Video] Hillary Clinton delivered a disgusting speech today claiming that Trump supporters are racists. We have a response you ll love Our video response to the racist and disgusting #HillaryInReno speech earlier today. #AltRightMeans decency.https://t.co/EqN3Vr3HNQ Rep. Steven Smith (@RepStevenSmith) August 25, 2016 

What's so racist and disgusting about the ""alt-right"" is it isn't simply racist and hateful. It's downright evil. It represents an extreme right-wing movement that embraces the racist concept of white supremacy.

As the American Conservative's Jim Hoft writes, it's nothing new to Trump supporters to use anti-immigrant rhetoric. But it's new for one Republican congressman to openly say ""alt-rightism should be a hate group"" — and then attack anyone who disagrees that he wants to unite the party with conservatives.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has been a vocal opponent of Trump in the past. Chaffetz, though, has been an ally of Republican Sen. John McCain, Trump's former Republican presidential nominee — both men voted ""no"" on Trump — but Chaffetz was one of the first GOP members of Congress to say he was open to discussing the possibility of Trump and the GOP joining forces against the party's presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Clinton responded by threatening to jail his leadership if he didn't do as she told him.

Chaffetz — who, as it turned out, actually voted against Trump's original ""deportation force"" plan — isn't alone in being racist toward his own party. In fact, the conservative wing of the party has long been known for the racism it espouses at this country's borders — including the infamous ""Hail Trump!"" rallying cry.

Now, according to Politico, Rep. Tom Reed, R-Rochester Hills, will likely have to work even harder to get his caucus on board with Trump after he used that same racial slur and made a ""hateful and racist suggestion"" during that same hearing last year.

Now, to clarify. Rep. Tom Reed's statement today on the Trump campaign, which he used in court as a defense of an email that was sent to one of his supporters, didn't say anything racist about the Trump campaign. — Paul Waldman (@pwaldman) August 25, 2016

In the email Reed apparently forwarded the to the racist group, a member of an alt-right chat chat app called ""Antiques Roadshow"" told the owner that Trump was ""a piece of shit"" who should be running away from the country.

I was shocked and alarmed to find out today that on June 9th members of a political organization have published a letter that said Trump is going to ""drain the swamp",1
" Baptist Preacher: The Government Needs To Be Killing ‘Sodomites’ (VIDEO) Ever since the horrific act of senseless violence that was perpetuated on LGBT venue Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, the most hateful preachers imaginable have been coming out of the woodwork to praise the shooter s actions. One of those preachers is Roger Jiminez of Sacramento, California s Verity Baptist  Church, who has been endorsed by Mike Huckabee and Sarah Huckabee Sanders .

But what sets Veronica Jimenez apart from most anti-LGBT hate speech is that she never mentioned the shooting at LGBT nightclub Pulse, or the anti-gay anti-LGBT policies that followed (and continue to do so).

No, she only talked about gay Christian hate groups who had attacked her congregation. But to this day, the pastor doesn't even know that she's talking about him personally.

In 2008, Veronica Jimenez wrote a letter to her own church, urging them to vote against a local law that would allow anti-LGBT discrimination to continue in this country. She wrote, ""As a Christian, if you don't approve of LGBT people getting married the way they choose to, then please, stand with those who are fighting against what they deem to be sinful choices.""

If her church approved of the anti-gay bigotry then, she should have mentioned it, but why doesn't she?

No matter how ""hateful"" anyone might feel about gays, they shouldn't have to hide from us or our community so that they can stay protected. A religious leader like Veronica must stand up to hate, even if that is the hate they find most objectionable, or that they see as ""wrong,"" and it is only when they express their view that we as a community have a chance to listen.

Verity Jimenez has been a vocal proponent of the anti-gay agenda for many years. She also serves on the board of both Americans United and Liberty Counsel and has made repeated statements of support for same-sex marriage and LGBT rights in general. What makes Jimenez's words so relevant today, or should they be read at all, is that her husband, Jim, and son, Joe, have also been a vocal advocate for anti-gay policies.

Verity is, or will be, forced to speak to this reality because the Supreme Court has ruled against them, and we've had a government that has not lived up to its promises.

Verity is a member of the National Organization for Marriage, and is a supporter of same-sex marriage and of traditional marriage.

"The Political World After Trump’s Win The Political World After Trump’s Win November 13, 2016 The Democratic Party’s long sojourn into corporate-friendly politics – and neglect of its old working-class base – has led to the shocking result of an erratic and untested outsider becoming President. But is there a route back, asks Joe Lauria. By  Joe Lauria Published on October 27, 2016 10:40pm Eastern Daylight Time The presidential race has been a rout for the Republicans, but they will be on the defensive in November. As Hillary Clinton heads to California for the final stretch of debate prep, she will have a critical question mark hanging over her head. The Clinton campaign believes its candidate can't afford to lose any counties, and that it is confident it will hold California, Nevada, Illinois and Ohio – and probably Pennsylvania too. But there may be a hitch, says David Bernstein, author of the new book America: The Great Escape. ""No candidate in history has ever been so unpopular, so far down,"" he says. ""They are just not able to find one path back to winning."" But how can one recover from such an unspectacular campaign? What will people have left to complain about? What about the Democratic primary, which has already proven to be one of the most bitter contests in recent congressional history? How can an electorate become so demoralized and so tired that they have had to accept defeats with no resistance? And how do you persuade voters to come back for you, particularly after so much of their time has been spent complaining against those in power? There is no easy answer for these questions because Trump has had so much free media attention to distract the Republicans at home and on the campaign trail. The last person to take him seriously was the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, whose death in November was followed by an implosion of the liberal left that sent a tsunami of angry tweets, calls for his impeachment and calls for impeachment hearings. But Obama's presidency was more difficult for many Democrats to digest. His unpopularity and the slow march toward civil war in Syria and Ukraine led Clinton to campaign last year as the ""presumptive nominee."" And by Clinton's own admission, even though she won a large and respectable victory over Trump and a large defeat for Obama, her political support among white voters in the Rust Belt has not recovered from 2008, which gave the Democrats a two-year electoral advantage. Hillary Clinton is in her last term, after all, and her party is also trailing. While polls show Democrats remain slightly more likely than Republicans in the South and the Great Plains states to have voted for Clinton, the party has yet to gain momentum. In fact, Republicans appear to have turned the tables and shown signs of pulling in voters from all over: Trump supporters are making up a wide and growing proportion of Republicans. Hillary Clinton's campaign is clearly focused on a state-by",1
"TRUMP SUGGESTS People Should Sue ABC NEWS After Massive Stock Market Crash Triggered By #FakeNews Report On Michael Flynn President Trump is not giving ABC News a pass for their fake news story about Michael Flynn and his meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak when Trump was a candidate running for office. The President is suggesting that ABC News needs to be held accountable for the drop in the  number of viewers.

From the transcript in the ABC News story below the video:

I want to give you an example, it was just last week, that just happened, ABC News reported that Donald Trump called the news of Michael Flynn's meeting with the Russian Ambassador as ""fake news."" It was like a big story. And again, when I started hearing it, because I saw it myself — and many others who were there, and they were talking about it.

But you know, it was so fake-like. It was so big that they had to take it down. And now it's just getting worse.

I think we have to show that they tried their best to cover it up. And because of the way the news coverage was, because of the way the campaign was, because of what I said, you know, my view, as you know, the president told me as recently as June, ""If it's fake news on fake news or if it's fake, I don't like it."" When it comes to the people and the press and the press — I think you can call it what you want — when it comes down to reporting, that is a good example, to me, of fake news. I don't like it when it's so fake like it was in that clip that you see.

Again, just so you're up to speed, let me go through it, ABC News.

First of all, Mike Flynn was on a call with the Russians the day before the election about sanctions. He wasn't asked about that. He wasn't asked about Russian efforts to hack our election. He wasn't asked about anything except the sanctions issue. He asked about Russia's efforts to hack our election, just hours before the election, just hours before Trump came in.

Secondly, the story was not new and was not based on what Mike Flynn said or what he reported to us. It was based on what Michael Flynn claimed to have said to the Russian ambassador that day, what he said was just false.

Thirdly, the same exact reporting as you see in this clip is happening on ABC News right now. ABC News has decided to do a story about an anonymous Republican operative who was allegedly told by an ABC News source that Hillary Clinton used her position at State as Secretary of State to facilitate the leaking of top-secret documents in violation of the Espionage Act.

That report was not based on what Mike Flynn actually said or who",1

The other key factor in determining the value of a property is that certain events have a specific or associated value. For example, the property value of a resource can tell you what is stored on that resource, and also, which operations are being performed on that resource. However, while a property can show information about the state of the resource, it can also show all the states in a resource. For example, the value of a resource can indicate:

a property value of the resource;

a description of the resource;

whether the resource is public, private, public-key, or private-key.

For a general description, it's possible to use the term properties in combination with properties . For example, an object with a value of ""public*"" can be considered public when one or both its properties value public/1 . Likewise, a property with a value of ""private-key*"" can represent a public key on a device or network. A property also represents certain other related information about the resource, like the state of the device or application, which can be associated with a specific property when used the same way. The type of information that can be described is the type that the property is associated with:

type property value public*

Type properties can also return property values. For example:

{ ""name"" : ""foo"" }

The value of a property's type can be written as [keyword][value] . If the property's value is ""public-key"", the value of ""private-key"" must be a string, like 'pubkey' . The value ""public-key"" is an integer. The value ""private-key"" is an integer. For example; ""pubkey"" is the value of the property; ""pubkey"" is an instance of ""key"". The key's key property is a special property for keys of type key-number. If the value of a private property's key is the same as its property's key, then it's used to represent the keys as strings (""foo"" as ""foo-bar"", etc.). For example; if a private key's value is ""a"", then its key property will be an instance of ""key-a"" which will be a string of the form ""a(a+b)a(a+b)a(a+b)"" .

"US Government and the Clinton female: Come to the Psychiatrist's Couch America is going nuts. Suggestions stupidly abound about how Russian hackers are even going so far as to read people's emails. Of course there is absolutely zero evidence of this. Russians are being blamed for everything from flooded toilets, biting dogs, the tornadoes in Kansas, the kid's messy diapers, the  bad rap for sleeping through class, etc.

If you're a liberal in the US, you're being bombarded with information about a massive threat of mass data mining, spying and cyberbullying from the CIA and other global intelligence agencies. How do they react to this? They're going to start acting in the best interests of the US and other Western nations (especially Germany, Japan, France, UK) by ""taking down"" the supposed Russian ""Hacker"" and sending a message to all Americans and all western governments to stop taking Russia's word over the NSA's and Google's: the US knows more about the internet than Putin. We can't wait for America to act with our own intelligence.

So it's going to be really, really, really bad:

If you don't accept this message you really need to get your ass out of here NOW and get back to work before November 8th, and America is doomed. And we don't need any more US elections where our elected leaders are taken for a wild ride while they get to take their sweet time in putting our lives and freedom on the line so that they can ""take care"" of their foreign allies, like their allies across the pond to whom they do ""vetting"" and ""deploy"" the enemy before they leave town. This is a huge joke because the US is a multi-lateral foreign policy player, and it's the people who do the ""vetting"" and do those secret ""deployments"" who will pay the ultimate price for America's bad behavior when they take action to help stop us when they realize we're doing things to interfere with their power — all without their consent. All the while, the Obama administration is acting like it's doing everything it can to help Russia, but the Obama's are now being caught red-handed lying about Russian hacking. (You'll also notice that Russia isn't even being accused of doing anything wrong, if you really look at their actions — the FBI has not charged them, and the intelligence community says they're not even the ones who were responsible for the Russian ""hacking."" If you believe this one, and we suspect it's not a coincidence that it's happening now, you'll likely be pleased that the Democrats are now blaming everyone, including the Obama administration, for America's bad behavior.)

"BREAKING: GUN STORE OWNER Claims He DID Report Florida Terrorist To FBI Weeks Before Massacre If you see something say something and maybe, if the FBI isn t too busy spending all of their time and resources investigating a presidential candidate who should already be in jail, they ll do something about it A gun store owner reported Orlando shooter Omar Mateen to authorities weeks  earlier.

And the president didn't help himself by attacking a gun store owner who bought the .223-caliber gun from him.

""The sad thing is if you look through the database, what you have are maybe 4 or 5,000 records related to people that purchase firearms from me, and that is the first they're gonna know who it would help,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday morning.

There's one more thing that was not included in the president's press briefing this morning: the first time he spoke to Sean Hannity.

""The reason I'm putting these records on the internet is that when I went through security, I saw a list of names and my first question was, 'What does that mean?' and the people on that list probably don't understand — that you got your records, you don't even have a social security number, you don't have a driver's license, you don't even have a credit card,"" Trump said.

" Mooch Changes His Tune, Says Reporter ‘Absolutely’ Recorded Him Without Permission So here s a funny hypothetical: You re a White House Communications Director. You ve settled into your office in the West Wing. You have a definite connection with the boss your speaking styles are similar, you come from the same moneyed and even geographical background, and just for good  measure you have access to a number of people whose offices are under President Trump's desk. You find yourself surrounded, for reasons unclear, by some of his team. So you walk out onto the conference room floor and you say to the President, ""Mr. President, what do you think of Donald Trump?"" President Trump's reaction is to nod sagely. You say, ""Thanks, sir. But we are not here to get into his head. I need the facts. I need facts from them and I need them now."" A moment passes. He looks at you and says, ""I understand."" He looks back down the hallway to his team and says, ""Do not let him tell you he does not know me."" What's the right response? The most likely response is to go on Twitter and try to make yourself heard by asking for the truth and to express displeasure with the President's actions. Then there's even a better strategy: you can wait for your response. But if President Trump refuses to listen, then you can be sure that the President will be prepared to listen to everything you say. And if he refuses to listen, you can be absolutely certain that he will try to silence you from the White House email thread for as long as you're there.

The most important reason to stay quiet is because Trump will try to punish you if he can. He's a real person, and if you are an honest person, you must not play it safe. But if you refuse to answer the President's call, the President will not be able to retaliate. As my friend Steve Benen once said, ""If someone asks, you can't be too open or too quiet."" And then you will know if your position has been compromised and that you should speak out to protect your own career. Because the President and his people will probably be very pleased if you don't come here today. They'll likely try to take your name off their financial disclosure forms in an effort to discredit you. They'll attempt to find out if what you've done is against federal rules and procedures. And you've already taken that action to protect yourself. And in a few moments, you'll probably take that action to protect our country and to protect the President himself.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things you can do. But I believe that one of the most important steps you can take is to remain nonverbal and let your voice be heard to the extent possible. If you want to keep your job—or perhaps have your",1
"WHAT FBI’S COMEY JUST REVEALED Should Disqualify Hillary Clinton For Any Public Office! [Video] FBI Director James Comey was literally destroyed today in his testimony on the Hill. What s even more damaging is the information about Hillary Clinton and her staff that Comey simply let go with no punishment at all. During the series of questions, Comey took heat from Gowdy, Jordan and  even a few Republicans like Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a staunch friend of Clinton who is up for reelection in 2018, before he even finished telling the story. ""The only reason the FBI director didn't say, 'Hey, I'm not going to recommend charges' is because he's afraid the Democratic party's going to come after him for not taking action,"" he said. ""And I think a lot of Republicans are trying to figure out how, if the FBI director can't protect them in this election, he should ever be charged with anything at all."" Comey defended his decision not to tell Congress about the new emails, saying the letter came in the wake of Hillary Clinton's emails coming out, and that he hadn't been prepared for that and didn't know what to expect from it. ""I know I'm not the first FBI director to have made decisions that were based purely on that and other information. But I wanted to be absolutely clear how I thought it was handled, particularly on my conclusion about Secretary Clinton,"" he said. And while Republicans in Congress questioned why Comey didn't go to Congress as soon as the FBI published its new assessment of the Democratic nominee's use of a private email server, it wasn't until after Republican Congressman Jim Jordan was grilled about the decision not to indict Comey for recommending no charges that Republicans finally got him to answer their questions about the timing. ""Are you worried about whether we will never get those emails, we're afraid, because I've had people ask me if they've ever talked to you about what was the timing of this decision?"" Jordan asked.

The only reason he didn't bring up that earlier report is because ""I told him I want to go as soon as I know."" You are supposed to ""go as soon as I know"", right?

It's impossible to see how Trump's investigation doesn't be at least a partial effort to delegitimize the Trump-Russia investigation, and if he can't even muster the strength to call on Comey to do just so, it seems he will have to rely on other sources for the same conclusion — at best, he'll have to rely on reports in the mainstream media about why he should indict Clinton even more.

Trump may have already found a way around that, and if I had any doubts, I don't know what he'll tell Comey tonight and in the weeks to come: There is always room for the Comey drama to grow.

"Huma Abedin's Screening Process for Hillary Visitors Raises 'Pay for Play' Questions Getty - Andrew Theodorakis As more and more internal emails and documents show up through Wikileaks and other sources, America has seen the curtain pulled back dramatically on the current state of politics. In one of the most recent emails that the Daily Caller obtained through Citizens United, the receding  curtain may prove to be a blessing, too. This email from the then Clinton White House chief of staff Cheryl Mills (above) has been in public sight since August 2013, but is not available to the public. It was sent to then Secretary of State John Kerry when the latter was still on the job, as President Obama was in transition to the next US presidency. According to the email, Hillary and Bill Clinton had been at lunch. In an August 2010 email, Cheryl Mills' chief of staff was on vacation with Bill Clinton. As Clinton leaves office, he writes to Mills in an email message from his office, ""I had the privilege of meeting with my old friend, Cheryl Mills and her husband John in Las Vegas, NV, last night to discuss issues related to our marriage."" The email, which has since been deleted from the president's communications archive, included an excerpt from a book Clinton had written with the help of a friend. A few days later, Mills and Bill arrived at Trump Tower for a meeting with Trump confidant Roger Stone. As the email notes: ""Roger and I had a long talk and had an interesting conversation discussing his past experiences. If anyone was interested in having him on as a consultant, please do me the favor and let him know.""

If you're the kind of person who's excited about the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency, this could be a scary one, and you might want to prepare yourself for the worst.

This is the second announcement from the FBI this past week that the agency decided Hillary Clinton should not be investigated for mishandling classified material—the first one came on Friday.

In the email revelations, it turns out that the FBI found new emails relating to Clinton's own use of a private server, which she used to send and receive classified information on more than 1,000 occasions. That's right—from March of 2009, through September of 2014 (and through January of 2016), there were no indications that she knew she was breaking the law; instead, her actions seem entirely out of line with the norms that define how institutions should function.

What's the FBI's case?


The Clinton Foundation, and a handful of other donors, made millions of dollars in pay-to-play donations. The State Department used State Department funds to give free meals to around 50,000 foreign diplomats, officials, and guests on State Department business from 2009-2015. All of those donors are ""under review,"" which is a pretty vague thing to say, but what is being done?

The Clinton Foundation's chief executive officer (CEO) gave more than $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation over the course of that same period. Most recently, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton were given access to a private server that used a BleachBit email archive from 2011. That email would have been deleted in June 2015, but Hillary didn't just get a freebie; rather, she got to keep her emails for the years after. In other words, Hillary received money that was supposed to go to the Clinton Foundation without having to hand over any of her emails.

The FBI has said that Clinton likely never met the standard her foundation set for the use of a private email address because they used BleachBit for email. ""The FBI is not aware of or looking into these claims, and has not corroborated them,"" the department said in a press release, according to The Washington Post. The State Department took the same position.

"HOT OR NOT? Are Trump Properties Selling Like Hotcakes? [Video] One agent Gilad Azaria has 7 listings in Trump buildings, and since the election he s had 4 serious buyers in the $3 million range. He also says 2 of his clients who already live in Trump properties want to trade up in the same buildings to more expensive places.  So yes, the agents may have a better chance of being able to make ends meet in a Trump building than in a condo.

That brings us to that last item. Is there a loophole to this? Not even close! When you look into the Trump properties and the brokers who list them, you will see people list property values in New York states. Many are listed in Pennsylvania. What if another New Yorker who lives elsewhere in a Trump building wants his tax dollars diverted by making a move to a Trump building? It's illegal and that's the end of all this.

Here's what Trump's tax attorney, Jamie Gorelick, says on the ""Tax Policy Center's show: Trump for President."" ""The tax code does limit how much an individual can earn during this period, but there are some exceptions. You might be allowed to write off capital gains if you are an employee of the federal government, or use part of your income to pay for travel to a certain place. There are a long list of exceptions to these rules and I think this is the first time we've really heard about these exceptions in a major campaign as we have had a lot of opportunities to see the details."" He went on to address the possibility that some of these exceptions are not quite as broad or complete as he says they are:

""You can be a resident and not pay income taxes or claim your state income taxes for this period. These exceptions have been expanded over time to provide more flexibility as states have created more, but we've always said that the tax code should reflect that we shouldn't be asking people to make hard choices where they live, and if something is fair to you, this will be it.""

This is the type of response that can cause you to think Trump didn't really want this lawsuit and had a legitimate excuse for trying to skirt it. And we don't believe it. If the real reason he is seeking exemptions from the standard state income taxes is to avoid the possibility of the IRS being able to see what taxes he owes, then he's wrong.

One of Trump's primary legal arguments was that he has a ""character of not paying taxes"" as stated in a New York Times story, where the president said: ""I will build a great, great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me.""

But here's the thing: Trump has not actually said how he intends to pay them back when he says he is a ""very low tax individual."" And",1
"Readings in the Jewish Zionist Control of the United States: Interviews with Francis Boyle, James Petras, Kim Petersen Part 1: Introduction 10 Shares 9 0 0 1 For the last 30 years, I have witnessed and experienced the severe restraints on any free and balanced discussion of the facts. This reluctance to criticize any policies of the Israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the  American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). It is also because of the extraordinary influence of American politicians. I cannot begin to convey the level of political intervention that the United States is willing to put up with from any country -- especially America's most powerful. My own mother experienced this, as did two other Jewish sisters in New York City. It is simply wrong to think that my mother had anything to do with the decision to send her a letter to Israel asking how she could help me or help my grandfather escape the Holocaust. I will spare you my personal story. It is my grandmother. My grandmother died on October 8, 1981, and as a young girl I watched my mother go through a rough patch before she was liberated from her mother's iron grasp in the hospital. When we were young, my mother worked for a grocery store that sold meat and poultry from the kosher grocery chain that was owned by my father's company. My parents worked for several smaller businesses and were also regular customers of the nearby kosher supermarket. My mom would walk over to each grocery store to buy her lunch -- even though the supermarket didn't own all or half of his businesses, my father owned all or most of the non-kosher restaurants. If he owned a grocery store, he would make sure that his groceries were all kosher. It was this simple principle that my mother would follow daily. I remember thinking to myself: ""If this is how I lived all my life, then why are I a Nazi today? Why are we going to the gas chambers?"" She was young, but she became very active in her community. She organized Jewish programs and helped raise funds for schools and organizations that supported disadvantaged children. She was also well traveled and learned Hebrew by the time she was seven, and was highly educated as a psychologist. She was well liked in the community and was a member of a very well-respected Jewish social service organization. However, her religious upbringing did not change. She had been baptized after the wedding of my grandfather back in May of 1931 and remained an active member even later on. She was born in the tiny farming community about ten miles outside of New York City. Her name was Lulowitz Gertrude, but because of her strong Jewish background, she had little difficulty adapting to life in New York City. There were many things she loved about New York City. While she did not really understand or appreciate the things the city did for her, she could easily see for herself the similarities and differences (including the differences in clothing)",1

"DNC Head Leaked 2nd Debate Question to Hillary DNC Head Leaked 2nd Debate Question to Hillary October 31, We're not talking about Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the ex-muppet in charge of the DNC who was forced to resign because of the way the DNC rigged the process to favor Hillary. This is Donna Brazile who was brought in to  oversee the DNC to fix these problems and is responsible for bringing out the big, shiny blue paper. Hillary is supposed to be the one whose policies will help working people, not the other way around. Don't forget it wasn't Hillary who got the money, it was her Wall Street benefactors! So much for the phony talking points to distract us from a massive corporate handout to the DNC and Hillary. If Hillary wins, she is going to end up with the most radical program for our lives in a very long time. She can't be in charge of the police department, military, or justice system, and then continue to raise millions of dollars from Wall Street. Hillary Clinton is going to end up with nothing except wealth, a government job, and endless problems, not working with working people and taking their money away to buy her policies. For months, Clinton's campaign and her media have been trying to keep this topic out of the media but now you've got people that are making sure you don't get any exposure. If you didn't see what she said yesterday to the Wall Street Journal you probably don't have much to lose! Here's a link to more information on why Donna is bad for America. She has literally put the lives of tens of thousands of people at risk just to protect Hillary's Wall Street donors! The only person responsible for this massive corporate payout against working people is Donald Trump. The Wall Street donations have to stop and Donald Trump has to speak out!

" John McCain’s Granddaughter SHREDS Donald Trump, Declares Support For Hillary In one of the best takedowns of Donald Trump yet, John McCain s granddaughter did NOT hold back as she explained why she is voting for Hillary Clinton in November.Caroline McCain has been against Donald Trump since last July when he mocked her grandfather for getting captured by the enemy . She is now considering a return to the political forefront as she joins forces with Bernie Sanders to fight back against Donald Trump.""I want this country to be at peace. I know what it takes to break out of the worst of the chaos Trump has thrown us into,"" McCain explained. ""I never liked Donald Trump or Donald Trump's supporters but there's nothing else I can do for them now that I know that he's not going to run again and be a candidate for president again.""While Caroline McCain may not believe he has changed, her views have changed, and she thinks there is only one candidate who can help her win the next election against the Trump administration.""My grandmother is against everything he stands for,"" she said. ""She's the only granddaughter of a former Navy officer from New Hampshire, an Army officer, an Air Force veteran. I have had this opportunity to see firsthand how these men protect our country and our values. Her heart belongs to us,"" John told the crowd.McCain is now weighing her options at the state level. Her husband, Ron, plans to endorse her for House or Senate but wants to see her work for change as an Army colonel in Iraq.""I don't care what Donald Trump says or anything he says for that matter, my grandfather was right — the more chaos and anger that comes out of a president, the less stable that government becomes,"" McCain said. ""I cannot support a man who talks down to our troops; I cannot support a candidate who calls women names; I cannot support a candidate who tells us to get over ourselves, even if that means getting angry.""The retired Army officer's mother, Debbie McCain, is making it clear she will not be backing anyone but Hillary Clinton.

"Comment on Obamacare Architect Gruber Demands “Larger Mandate Penalty” by marlene Posted on October 27, 2016 by Paul Joseph Watson Bureaucrat who said “stupidity” of Americans helped get law passed doubles down Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber – the bureaucrat who once bragged that the “stupidity” of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place . But it wasn't; it was the American people who voted against the health care law because they couldn't bear to live with that law.

The law was written by the Department of Health and Human Services, and passed by Congress in 2009. This bill was in place before that, and it was called the Affordable Care Act. This was an attempt to pass and expand the Affordable Act from its foundation to its application to the marketplace. The ACA required that private insurance companies provide a minimum set of benefits, and that everyone receive at least basic coverage from their doctor and pharmacy, including access to preventive care. But, as you can imagine, many Americans were not thrilled with basic coverage and many opted out of the individual market. Because of these fears, the law required that government run these insurance exchanges because of the problems it caused. Thus, the Affordable Care Act required private insurance carriers to provide insurance until they figured out how to offer it. And they did so by providing high premiums that were a major factor in how this bill passed.

While critics noted that Republicans had already decided that a mandate-based plan was the way to go, the fact is, no one who's heard of the American health care system in decades could have possibly been surprised—this is what the Affordable Care Act did to Obamacare. And that is one of the reasons why Republicans had to back off from that last piece of legislation (there was opposition from an independent expert commission about it), before they made any more progress.

In fact, when you review Obamacare's failures and mistakes over its long history, they aren't some major failure to understand the system—they are far more glaring failures, from the law's beginning.

As someone who understands some of the basics of health care, I would not be surprised if the United States government would soon do a massive overhaul to Obamacare, replacing it with a new and much less costly system in order to make it work.

Here's a short summary of Obamacare from the original White House website:

As stated above, the ACA was supposed to allow people to choose whether they would get health insurance based on their health needs, their age, their pre-existing conditions, or some combination of those three factors. In theory we should like to have government-run health insurance, because it would be affordable for everyone, regardless of age, gender, race or geography. Health Care Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 3429)—signed into law by President Barack Obama in early 2010—impro",1
"STATE FUNDED PROGRESSIVE INDOCTRINATION: COLLEGE PROF DEMANDS Students Adopt His Atheist Beliefs And Leftist Views…Or Fail Emboldened by a radical leftist President who thumbs his nose at our Constitution and the core values our nation was founded on, our teachers and professors in colleges and universities across America are ramping it up. Our children and our nation will pay a heavy price unless we step and  take this courageous step.

It's time for our politicians to stand up to the Left and start fighting back against their radical agenda. For once, our voices must be heard, not merely by those within their own party, but also by other members of the Republican Caucus who do not have a choice but to work with the President and those across America who want our Constitution and our schools protected and protected at all costs.

To my colleagues across the aisle on the other side of the aisle, the only way to stop this radical agenda is to hold our government to the highest possible standard. So we must not allow this Congress to abandon this cause, and we must not let their cowardice, or fear of a backlash, lead these children to their demise. I have no doubt we will win. We can and must lead by example here in Congress, and I pledge to do all I need to do.

In defense of American workers, we must be relentless in the fight against the anti-America, corporate special interests who hold our country hostage in the interest of corporate profit. This is a fight I was not able to win at the beginning of my Administration. I have never been a leader. That's where I must learn, but we must be relentless and relentless.

My opponents say I am insufficiently tough but I'm getting stronger. My policies are not being met with the response they crave; now it is time to take them to the voters and we must. We must give them the choice whether to fight or run. I know that not every American is a leader, just as never before.

At the Democratic National Convention in July of this year, some were so desperate to prove they are serious and have enough backbone to win the White House that there were speeches that were nearly comical — an elderly man said, ""I'm running in my 60s for re-election against the President. I feel I have the legs to do it. I'm older, more experienced, with a little bit more experience. I'll take the risks. I'm running for reelection because I'm concerned for America. I'm running to fight the same bad policies that they are taking away from you and me.""

His only claim to success in office is a failure to mention the economy. This statement should make all of America's politicians blush. In the first 20 years of his Presidency, our country has grown at half the rate of America's gross domestic product and more workers have the means of supporting themselves.",1
"Utah's Evan McMullin Endorses Hillary Clinton, Says His Only Goal is to STOP TRUMP This is what we expected all along. The #NeverTrump independent candidate Evan McMullin is working to eliminate Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton. The #NeverTrump Republican candidate last week told reporters all Republicans are racist. The #NeverTrump movement hopes McMullin will steal enough votes from Trump for Hillary to win . Now it looks like the former Texas congressman is going all in on his promise of voter suppression to suppress minorities and the poor. On Thursday, McMullin was arrested after he tried to steal a car with two men at his side. ""It's the first time I've ever been arrested for taking part in a voting rights march.""

One is John McGlinchey, who is the head of a conservative group in New Hampshire. McGlinchey is a Trump critic so that's a big surprise. He also claims he came with the intent of stealing the car from the black group. He went to the police station without permission and was later arrested after telling officers he wasn't going to give it back after all. The car was recovered after officers showed up and the car's tag says it's the McGlinchey that it belongs to. Police told NBC local in New Hampshire in an email that ""McGlinchey is not one to leave a trail and is not a threat."" It wasn't until after a judge ruled that anyone with the car wouldn't be allowed to enter it without being arrested that the vehicle returned.

Another group, People United for Conservative Justice, has taken McMullin to task over alleged racism in the campaign. The Justice Working Group, run out of North Carolina says there is ""no evidence that Trump has systematically disenfranchised African-Americans,"" while People United argues that McMullin has ""disproportionately attacked the rights of young people,"" and ""took advantage of minorities."" But if McMullin is trying to steal the car (and maybe even the motorcade) he is apparently doing it with an eye on this weekend's election.

The only thing that surprises me, so far, is how much energy McMullin has. He was elected president and it seems like he's a natural of the White House. It's very strange that his campaign has been in the news for so long and so little on it in recent months. I suppose it's not that McMullin is an unknown to anybody outside the Republican base, but it can't help but be strange that he's still gaining traction.<|endoftext|>It seems like the best thing that could happen to the NBA has been happening for most years now, especially once the All-Star Game became an actual thing.

"Hillary Abruptly Stops At Rally, Couldn’t Hide What Happened Seconds Later Hillary Abruptly Stops At Rally, Couldn’t Hide What Happened Seconds Later Posted on October 27, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This While speaking at her latest rally in Florida, Hillary Clinton’s speech took an abrupt turn as she just stopped in the middle of a sentence. Unfortunately for  her, she couldn’t control herself from interrupting the rest of the rally to deliver a speech that was supposed to be upbeat to the Clinton campaign’s biggest fan. She could not suppress her excitement in the face of a crowd that was clearly looking forward to her speech. If you missed it, watch the video to get an idea what she was saying.


Hillary Clinton’s rally in Florida on October 27th (YouTube Link) More from Robert Rich: From the New Yorker: ""Hacks, like everything, are a game. This one is a game of skill."" And the thing is: skill and cunning are two sides of the same coin. When something is clever but not clever about it, it is usually just bluff and guesswork, not strategic thinking. For example, Hillary Clinton has long called for comprehensive immigration reform. She has no idea how the Senate will vote. But it is smart to act like her to make the case. To do that, you have to tell the truth. What a bad idea. Clinton does know this but, as far as she is concerned, anything less means that she is not serious about the issues that matter most to her supporters on this election -- namely the economy, immigration, and the environment."" And just the other day, at a rally in Wisconsin, Clinton also told voters: ""We've been out here working hard to reach out to every part of our country, to everybody."" Not surprisingly, those voters are already calling for a third-party candidate for president, while Hillary just continues to give the impression that her campaign is focused on keeping up with the Joneses, and that she should run if she has to, since she has the money and endorsements to run against Trump and not as Trump's running mate in a ticket with Paul Ryan.


Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Election Win Predictions: ""I think all of us will have to stand up to those who feel they need to silence minorities"" More from the New Yorker: ""[T]he message we want to deliver to the African-American community that we will stand for all of them and fight for everybody‒we've spent a lot of time on them‒is really about what we're going to do as president.

"Study: More Vitamin B In Mother’s Diet Reduces Risk Of Colon Cancer In Offspring in: General Health (image: shutterstock) Few experts question the influence a mother’s diet can have on her children’s long term physical health. Yet, many believe this effect is mostly sociological, limited to positive or negative role modeling, and the development of general dietary habits later in life. However, research suggests  mothers can play a causal role in young child development. In fact, mothers' physical health may have a significant influence on their child's growth. Evidence suggests that children of mothers who eat a well-balanced Western diet (Western diets have been shown to promote healthier growth rates, physical, mental, behavioral, dietary, and substance use behaviors) enjoy greater growth and developmental outcomes. Additionally, many researchers have found that mothers who eat a Western diet have a lower incidence of depression with respect to adult onset of major depressive disorder. Further, these studies indicate that mother-child interactions can impact child development by supporting a mother's positive role model and helping to promote emotional maturity. Furthermore, many studies suggest that mothers who have higher levels of positive mental and behavioral health practices are more likely to engage in positive parenting practices.<|endoftext|>A video posted by @huffingtonpost (@huffpost) on Nov 25, 2017 at 8:36pm PST

When it comes to women in tech, Twitter has given women an opportunity that we have to try out, and there's one thing that I want to ask: Is Twitter sexist or not?

I find it strange that, because we're an app, that some users of the site would take issue with being forced to interact with each other via the app. Maybe Twitter was just making an app, or maybe the app was just for Twitter (a bunch of us are very big fans of Twitter, right?). At any rate, the reaction to the incident seems to be, ""Who cares! I like what Twitter does.""

But it's not clear if Twitter is sexist. After all, you'd think that we, as women, would demand more female representation, right? We want the chance to contribute value to tech companies that value women's contributions. It would be nice if Twitter allowed us to express ourselves in a manner that allows more women (and men, generally) to connect to one another.

I'm not sure Twitter has a sexist intent, nor do I trust that, without some sort of action, Twitter could remove the negative effect that many, many men have on the company. I also think there were plenty of male employees that supported what Twitter did, like Ben Kuchera. If he had decided to tweet and say these things while the video was up, it wouldn't appear his tweet wasn't also sexist. So while we don't really condone what he did, being forced onto Facebook or Twitter because you didn't like what others had to say is not fair",1
"AUSTRIAN DISGRACE: No jail for Muslim migrant who dumped his own baby in the middle of the road after he got drunk and enraged BY CHRISTINE WILLIAMS The West has in effect developed a two-tier legal system for Muslims. The article below is about a baby being dumped in the road, with the Muslim migrant perpetrator escaping jail time. This follows another shocking recent report about the rape of a 10-year-old boy at a  school bus stop in Denmark. The boy is being identified as a member of the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim sect and was sexually abused by two of its members.

I was reading about how Mohammed Ali Mohamed had to beg a court to order the deportation of two of his friends because a policeman didn't believe they would face a ""fair trial.""

I was reading about the shocking case of a Muslim child being raped at the hands of a group of Dutch citizens who were acting as a guide and were being assisted by an adult in acting like a group of ""peacekeepers,"" with the help of a policeman to stop the child from walking home with his mother.

Finally, I was just watching the documentary on Channel 4 news showing how police are routinely and regularly beating children with their batons and using tear gas, baton strikes, and rubber bullets in the city of Wits.

The Guardian reported that it had ""spent more than six months investigating allegations of child sexual abuse in Britain's borough of Kensington and Chelsea — the second biggest in the capital — since it launched a wide-ranging inquiry last October.""

The Guardian reports that the investigation — funded by the charity Cage, which was established with funds from the former head of MI5, Dame Julie Cox — ""has found that there was 'systemic failure of governance and operational capacity with key forces — a failure to properly manage a high level of activity in custody' and 'a failure to protect children.' ""

It goes on to quote one of the children's lawyers, Chris Davies, who states that the police ""have the authority to act without any guidance from government or the courts; or they are too scared to because they do not think child protection matters are being looked into.""

It goes on to state, ""The inquiry has also documented widespread institutional problems within the local council and police forces, as well as the failure by police to act within their authority or with respect to the most vulnerable.""

While other media have noted that the evidence of police violence against children has led to police corruption charges in London, the vast majority (89 percent) of such children are treated with no violence or abuse and have no charges filed against them ever. It goes on to state, ""The inquiry findings have come as a massive shock to campaigners for justice in Britain's Muslim community. In April 2014, Lord Justice Leveson (who is now Lord Chief Justice) condemned the conduct of some police while he still lived in office, and called",1
" Guilty As Hell Paul Manafort And Rick Gates Enter ‘Not Guilty’ Pleas In Russian Collusion Scandal (TWEET/VIDEO) The world is exploding right now due to the news that Donald Trump s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort has been indicted on a litany of felony charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Manafort, as well as his business associated and fellow Trump campaign official Rick Gates have been taken  to federal court to answer questions about their work as part of the Trump campaign. Manafort, who is also reportedly under investigation, recently met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Manafort, who also served as campaign chairman, was indicted along with Gates at the same time for failing to file the required financial disclosure report on behalf of the family bank.

I'm sure this scandal will fuel a firestorm of rage against Manafort, but if you're one of those who actually bought anything worth anything or bought anything by Paul Manafort (or any of the other Trump business related businesses) you should already be aware of the details. Paul Manafort, like a lot of other Trump associates, has been caught laundering money through his company, Oleg Deripaska, which was controlled by a billionaire oligarch. The former Putin oligarch is the co-owner of a majority stake in a Russian state-owned oil company, Gazprom. It's not a secret that Paul Manafort worked closely at the highest levels of the campaign with the Russian government — and like the DNC hack, the public has been able to get a good look at this connection through the leaks by Wikileaks.

In 2011, Manafort was paid $14 million from the Russian Duma budget in cash and stock, $14 million was paid to Manafort's son, Aras, while he was at the Russian Institute of International Relations, $7 million of which appeared to be given in 2014 to Manafort and his son by Manafort and partner Gennady Timchenko. The former Ukranian Prime Minister Yevhen Zhenatoz, son of Yevgeny Zhenatoz, a businessman with a long resume of business dealings, was paid $4.65 million to $5.5 or some form of consulting fee on his 2015 foreign policy speech to the Council on Foreign Relations as well as speaking fees, commissions and loans to others at his former firm.

That isn't to say there was anything wrong with it, but Manafort did not disclose his full worth and was not on the required public disclosure forms. Additionally, some of the money allegedly being laundered from Russia to the USA was funneled through Paul Manafort — the ""guy we're supposed to believe is a man of integrity, who we're not supposed to trust."" When he was charged in July for money laundering and failing to file his taxes, Manafort admitted that the money he was alleged to have laundered had been used to buy influence for a pro-Putin party in Ukraine that helped elect Donald Trump.

At a court in the north London borough of Kensington and Chelsea there have been ""unprecedented"" protests against a police raid in which two men have been given lengthy prison sentences.

The men had been arrested after attacking two men in May while at a bar and assaulting another man, also in London. Both men sustained facial injuries.

Six police officers are on the run after they entered the premises in May. They have described it as an ""anti-terror"" operation.

The public prosecutor has said one of the men was arrested ""without any reasonable ground for suspecting"" he was armed and the other was ""on the street"" but did not appear to have carried a weapon.

A number of campaigners said the prison sentence appeared disproportionate, calling for an immediate review of the police powers granted to seize property and arrests without evidence",1
"Scattering of paedophile priests fine but not their ashes Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:25 UTC © Waterford Whispers News In a bid to clear up any confusion about their latest ruling on the cremated remains of loved ones, the Vatican confirmed it is still alright to scatter paedophile priests wherever they want, but not ashes. Yesterday the headquarters of  the Pontifical Council for Legislative Text was told by bishops across the country that it could put out remains if that was considered ""the most practical option"". ""Although the bishops have the right to send the deceased the remains of an adult priest, they cannot cause him any harm and if ashes need to be scattered, the bishop must do so before burying the other children,"" read a statement issued by the Vatican press office in Rome at the end of this week. While cremated remains are now allowed to be scattered, in some countries ashes are still considered less acceptable. A Catholic newspaper in Germany, for example, has said that the Pope would consider a ""fogger"" of ashes to be ""a serious crime"". Earlier in the week it emerged that the Pope was expected to issue an encyclical to reform the criminal justice system on Friday. His letter will also set up a new body in charge of child abuse cases, an initiative the Pope is expected to highlight in his forthcoming trip to the Vatican next week. Last week it was revealed that the Pope had warned that the Vatican Police were using ""unethical methods to arrest and punish paedophiles in the name of the protection of children"". A statement by the Vatican press office in Rome explained that when priests who have been convicted in a church case have been remanded in custody they must not be allowed to live anywhere other than in the Church's custody, and they cannot have anything to do with the victims of pedophile priest abuse unless they agree to stay away from children.<|endoftext|>We can all agree that the future is bright, but it's especially bright in the realm of health care. That's because by 2021, more and more Americans, especially the poorest, will need care, often for chronic diseases, and millions at-risk of chronic diseases will simply go untreated. It doesn't have to be that way.

But what does a future with fewer people for care look like? While we should be hopeful about the prospect of improved health-care access for the lowest among us, it's unlikely that any future in which people have access to comprehensive care will achieve what we need. A study led by Princeton University researchers found that if people had access to health insurance coverage in 2010, they'd still be over 60 and on average expected to live two years longer than today. As a result, the cost of paying for health care would rise by a grand total of roughly $1.4 trillion by 2025, which will put people on the poverty line at the same time that health care costs",1
"JUST IN: Flynn to Plead Guilty to Lying to the FBI The broader story in this entire Russia witch hunt is if the one count on Flynn announced today is a plea deal. Flynn is being charged with only one count so this raises red flags There has been talk that Flynn would do what he could to protect his son  and it was his decision to stay quiet on the Flynn investigation for several months. For that to happen, the FBI would have to determine this was a serious matter and in no way would they want to leave anyone vulnerable. We also have to remember Flynn was a close advisor to Trump and has close ties to the Russians and this is his way to protect the President. The other concern we have on Flynn is his son was born in another country of great power, so if he does plead guilty and admits he took a bribe to plead guilty, the Flynn-Russia story is over. He will be allowed to leave the country and he will be allowed to return home very soon.
If Flynn is arrested, there are many of us now who are not buying into the FBI and the story surrounding him.

Local police had told the AP a large force of over 400 to 500 militants had been spotted on Monday but they had not confirmed it.Two weeks after ISIS seized Mosul from the Iraqi government, which controlled it from 2014 until the U.S. troop withdrawal from its headquarters in 2014, the battle against ISIS seems inevitable. So how exactly does an ISIS-led military takeover happen? What's it like for their security forces?The answer will likely be hard to discern. Some of them seem to have an ISIS version of the SAS.The US-backed Free Syrian Army and its military allies have also taken advantage of the chaos in Syria to take control of key towns, like al-Bab with their command and control systems, at a cheaper cost than the Iraqi army. But even ISIS has difficulty competing in the region because it's a Sunni insurgency; its enemies are much more diverse, so it faces a huge range of opponents.So, where does this come from? Well it's from ISIS and al-Qaida's ideology; if you think of ISIS's ideology as a mix of Islamism and Wahhabism, it's a very simplistic concept when you consider the context. This is how ISIS first emerged in 2014.The Islamic State (Al-Qaeda) is an offshoot of al Qaeda,",1
"BEST REASONS TRUMP Is More Qualified Than Any Presidential Candidate We’ve Had In Decades Obama is against Trump Check The Media are against Trump Check The establishment Democrats are against Trump Check The establishment Republicans are against Trump CheckThe UN is against Trump Check The EU is against Trump Check China is against Trump Check Mexico is against Trump Soros is against Trump Check  The U.N. is against Trump Check Vladimir Putin is against Trump Check A former Obama aide who wrote for The Washington Post defended him on ""Fox and Friends."" He is against Trump and Clinton, but he is not a Trump supporter.

What are the problems with Trump, and why does he not do enough to address them?

Here, I want to talk to you about immigration and Muslim outreach.

You, as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, have the support of more than 90 percent of people in your party. Yet, your own immigration policies, which the public is not allowed to discuss, continue to make national news. If Trump and his base were to go all in, many would support them. For those of you who believe in building a wall, he also stands against Obama, and Hillary Clinton.

If you were to take these positions, what would be your immigration solution? What would you do to ensure that no Americans are brought here illegally?

I will tell you one thing -- it is not easy -- not easy for us, especially given, again, the immigration rate that we have. But let me also mention, however, that our leaders want to make it easier for people to come here legally.

But that is a little different than some of the people I discussed the other day.

Trump's policies were very controversial in Congress, to be sure.

There is plenty of agreement among American-born citizens to work on the issue. Our country has great respect for law enforcement. Many Americans agree that the government isn't doing enough.

President Obama, of course, is a law-and-order guy. He has a lot of critics. One of them -- my opponent -- says I am a criminal. You know, Hillary Clinton says that my wife's emails are classified. What she means is Hillary Clinton cannot defend her email. And I will tell you one thing -- that was never my goal. Her goal was Hillary Clinton. And she's wrong.

What kind of a leader would you be if you were on the other side of that fight?

Well, it's important to understand what this is, not a policy issue, but a national security issue. So, if Donald Trump were to pursue a more isolationist foreign policy, to put the US outside NATO, to leave China's sphere of influence, I believe this would be a national security risk for the United States. There is no evidence that they are involved in the kind",1
"Popular Theme Park Water Ride Malfunctions… Ends In Brutal Death Of 4 Patrons WATCH: Insane School Teachers Push Girls Into Snake Pit to Teach “Character Lesson” Their injuries were perceived as so severe by theme park staff and paramedics that Gavin Fuller of Queensland Ambulance described it as “incompatible with living.” The mother of Kate Godchild and Luke Dorsett, two of the victims,  was forced to give birth by an emergency helicopter during their ordeal and left to face the trauma of childbirth, which prompted Dr. Robert Hatton, senior lecturer at Melbourne University who witnessed the incident, to write”I don't care, I am going in, and I am going right into it:”That's the kind of courage, determination, and bravery that really puts you in a great place when it is called for.”What shocked me was what happened to her and her child.

They're trying to build support for a motion calling on government to support the creation of a federal carbon tax.

""I think people should be aware that we have the support of the premier in place to implement a carbon tax and we need your help,"" said Koster.

It's Koster's third visit to New Brunswick since July 19, when members of his ruling Liberals and Progressive Conservatives met on what was described as a joint platform and agreed to work closely on a carbon tax.

But he said Wednesday he wants to get the most out of this time by asking Canadians to help.

"A MUST WATCH: The Islamization Of Our Schools [Video] A short excerpt from CAN s upcoming documentary Exposed: The Islamization of Our Schools .This documentary-in-progress uncovers the ongoing, accelerating indoctrination of U.S. students to Islam, using U.S. taxpayer money.  (NOTE: The movie opens July 1st )

The film debunks anti-Islamic propaganda and shows how the public has ""unraveled"" its entire education system to a fundamentalist point of view. We will not allow our children or our communities or our Constitution to end up like the rest of the nations (most of which are Islamic nations) where children are indoctrinated to live under an entirely different God. Our children have been taught that there are no atheists, Hindus, or any other non-Muslim group. They are encouraged to think that the Western way of life is the only true way. They are taught that a woman has the right to define her own husband and to bear every child.

Children are taught that there is a ""good Muslim"" of course who will love God and teach his teachings to everyone, but the truth is that there are a number of non-Muslims which have lived a much more faithful life. But they simply did not conform to the West's strict religious ideals on the matter of marriage.

In addition to being indoctrinated by a number of people, a major cause of the spread of Islam is the fact that Muslims have the highest percentage of children under the age of 14. In fact Muslims have the highest percentage of children in our culture.

The following is a sample of what we know:

According to the U.S. Census, the total number of people below the age of 60 is 8.5 percent. Of the total population of America, a quarter are under 30. In comparison: the percentage of Muslims is 10 percent.

The percentage of Muslim people in America is over 8 percent.

In comparison... Muslims have the highest percentage of children of any nation and are the most religious people in America.

The vast majority of our Muslim children are children of parents who are Muslim, believe in Islam, and are not of that country or any other political party. In the U.S., it is estimated that between 60 and 70,000 kids are raised as atheists. The majority of these children are raised with a belief in God while the last 10 percent or so have no religious involvement whatsoever.

The main objective of the mainstream media and various religious leaders is to spread their Christian or Jewish or Hindu version of Islam, as evidenced by the numerous anti-Muslim events and media ""activities"" which routinely occur that are directed at creating Islamized societies.

The mainstream media, and a large portion of our society, are well aware",1
" Over 500 NFL Players Plan To Tell Trump To F*** Off Today In The Best Way Possible A backlash of epic proportions ensued after Donald Trump launched a war against African-American athletes who protest by kneeling during the national anthem. The former reality show star has managed to piss off players in three major professional sports and even went so far as to call Colin Kaepernick s —t in a series of tweets, calling him a ""son of a bitch.""

This incident comes to us courtesy of the Associated Press, which got ahold of a letter from three former players that addressed the alleged discrimination they experienced from the sport of sports on several levels.

Players and owners had never been instructed to kneel during the anthem prior to this game in Oakland, in protest of the police brutality against African-Americans. The league did not require it to stop until San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick did. Players had been taught, however, that it has to stay at least 45 seconds. All players can do is stand and take a knee, with the exceptions of defensive players who come to the flag with coaches.

Many players were concerned that the league would begin to discourage them from attending games for lack of understanding of what was occurring on an individual basis.

It was not until several weeks after the players' meeting with the owners did the players have something resembling clarity of intent regarding their intentions once being instructed on how to stand: ""The league was concerned and we encouraged them. … We weren't given the instruction at play-by-play. We were given no explanation regarding their position.""

They were told that they were allowed to kneel during anthem ""for the time it takes for them to go by the safety net of their playbook, which is a minute."" Players also received messages from NFL officials promising them that players will stand and take a knee ""if necessary.""

And since then, NFL teams have been forced to sit players because they aren't taking off their shirts and no longer wearing jerseys.<|endoftext|>For over 35 years, the original Star Wars movie series and series films have been brought to life with the original soundtrack from Episodes 1-13.

"HILARIOUS! LIBERALS STUNNED When Republican Guest Won’t Play Race-Baiting Game With MSNBC Host…Cuts Off Interview [VIDEO] On Saturday, MSNBC s Joy Reid repeatedly attempted to race-bait former Republican congressman J.D. Hayworth on her show AM Joy. NewsBusters reported that the claims that Reid threw at Hayworth ranged from false to misleading. Joy started out by asking if Hayworth had any discomfort that an undocumented woman walked  into a public restroom. Then she asked: If a woman walks into a private restroom, do you worry when she comes out?""

Reid: ""Oh, I'm trying to say he does."" Reid: ""I'm trying to say, I don't know if he has that discomfort, okay?""

Reid ended the segment by asking a question that should have never been asked. But MSNBC's Jim O'Donnell did. He asked, ""Shouldn't there be a place where a male citizen can get his picture taken with a female citizen?"" The network quickly added the next two segments as a reminder to viewers that the network is not objective.

O'Donnell: ""You say you won't run ads anymore on your show."" O'Donnell: ""Do these companies have to run these ads now? No. You can have ads on your cable service.""

""I would love to see your daughter or son, that come over and stand next to me and ask me for a picture, because we understand that you believe you should not live in the United States or, for that matter, to have access to the American Dream,"" Reid said to Hayworth, which could be heard on the recording.


Afterward, the MSNBC hosts continued to attack Hayworth on his views, accusing him of failing to understand the importance of voting. For example, O'Donnell said of Hayworth: ""If you're so concerned you're being ignored as a black guy voting, you have an even bigger problem: How does you decide what you are going to get from Washington?"" MSNBC anchors started to mock him as he struggled to defend his comments, suggesting that they did not understand that he does not mean he wishes to live in poverty.

""I was saying today a young person from Alabama who is homeless, and I'm asking you, do we have to pay those bills like a mother and daughter or do we have to be there to help them?"" Reid repeatedly asked him. Hayworth said of her daughter walking into a public restroom: ""I don't know if she has to go into a woman's restroom. I think that would be discrimination.""

On Monday, the network made clear that it has some new and very liberal policies in place. It announced that every one of the 60 shows on MSNBC will start carrying ads before the election (and if possible before its next",1

""The couple then attempted to join ISIS in Syria, but U.S. officials believe it was a failure of the FBI and DHS vetting process.""According to the article, authorities also tracked them down to a local mosque, where one had ""a knife in his hand when arrested,"" which ""apparently was a mistake for authorities to consider a significant threat.""Conway's error, the Bowling Green Post reported, was that she mistakenly had written Bowling Green ""were trying to join ISIS.""""Ms Conway has apologized for making an error and will no longer do so,"" said Scott C.

"NAMES REVEALED Of TOP DONOR And Popular ACTRESS Behind Disgusting Leftist Latino TV Ad Depicting White Man Running Down Minority Kids With Truck When a disgusting ad appeared on TV showing a white man in a pick-up truck with a confederate flag in the back, and an Ed Gillespie for Governor bumper sticker on the gate, that was chasing down a group of minority kids in their neighborhood, Americans from every political party  rallied to fight for this person, who they believe could beat President Obama.

And it happened, because this is a man who has said things that most Americans believe are wrong and has used that platform, as a political weapon against minorities, to try to drive out a small group of voters and change how people vote. It's been a successful political effort.

President Trump can't stop, nor should he attempt to, because the American people understand it's just not his game. They, too, know that it's wrong. They want him to be honest about that and say it, and not give them a false sense of the president's authority to do these things.

The American people have a right and a responsibility to judge these men by what they're doing and for what they're trying to do for them — to remove them from office and stop them from doing them harm, just like these kids did in Charlottesville.

This country was built on principles of justice, equality and freedom. We have a big tradition of making mistakes. To try to change a course just to get your party to support it is a real mistake.

To say, in effect, ""Hey, you know what, that guy said it, so we should all be like that, too,"" is like a political cheat code. These Republicans were given a path that would take these racists all the way to defeat. And, sadly, when they are denied the chance to pursue that path they instead try to undermine it with false charges and baseless allegations, all to try to change it, try to change it away from the real deal.

The president, I say to myself, and I think the president of the United States — the way he speaks about America and about his administration as well — has had to deal with that stuff his whole life. And to pretend otherwise is irresponsible, it's wrong.

We don't have time for political correctness anymore, don't have time to play along with the fake outrage that's so much a hallmark of politicians these days. We have to give these men, this racist group of Republican officials, the time and opportunity to correct and to fix these issues and we will.

It's an important, important time to bring these issues out and deal with them because right now, we're on the precipice of a very real threat to this country and to the nation.

"Researchers Accidentally Find Simple Way to Convert Harmful CO2 Gas to Green Energy In the scientific world, there is something called serendipity. The word is used to denote the occurrence or invention of something beneficial by chance. For years, governments and climate change activists have struggled to convince the world to cut down on greenhouse emissions. A greenhouse gas is any gaseous compound , including carbon dioxide, that rises or falls by more than about 20%.

But the best way to make money is for something good to happen. In an effort to make money, climate-change deniers have been turning their scientific arguments that global warming is a hoax into attacks on scientific integrity.

The most recent example of such a conspiracy is the denial-in-action by an online climate change activist group called Skepchick. The group was started by Sam Francis, an astrophysicist who said he helped to create the online climate science education blog WorldNetDaily (WND) in 2007.

""Skeptics"" can refer to those who doubt the existence of global warming, according to the SBA group's website, as well as ""beliefs that certain global warming scenarios are a hoax and that climate change has not happened.""

Skepchick has been linked with conspiracy theories including the belief that the United Nations Climate Change Conference is a hoax, and that the government is funding a climate change disinformation campaign to ""destroy faith in scientific decision-making.""

But skeptics who run the blog often defend their position by pointing to evidence from science, not government sources.

""It is important to realize that Skepchick has been and remains an independent political organization,"" Skepchick said in an email statement. ""The posts at their web pages, and their opinions, have no bearing on the activities of their organization or any political campaign with particular intent.""

Skepchick has yet to reply to any correspondence from the Post. Skepchick has not returned phone calls on time.

An email sent to the SBA said that the organization would not be commenting on ""specific personnel matters.""

The group is not the same as groups that ""denounced"" politicians, including James Hansen for leading a group called the Global Warming Policy Center (GWPCC). The SBA group has repeatedly criticized both those attacks and those who argue against climate change science.

There are no hard numbers for the number of people who believe in climate change denial, but the online activity by Skepchick, SBA and others suggests that people believe their opinions are important as well as their money, and that it's their ability to buy influence that makes a difference.

To get an idea of a typical day at the SBA, here is how it gets started. About 15 people at the SBA sit around a table in a",1
" BREAKING: Melania Trump’s Immigration Records Made Public, Show Trump’s ULTIMATE Hypocrisy GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline and even bigoted stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect deportation forces to root out and get rid of all people in  this country who do not pay their taxes by January 2017. While all immigrants in this country, especially those who live here illegally, are protected and should be allowed to stay, Trump would immediately start dismantling their legal status, making it virtually impossible for them ever to gain access to our democracy.

As Trump has outlined his immigration plan, it has been in line with the rhetoric of nativism and racism that have run rampant in the Republican Party for decades. But as we look to the upcoming election, and we look to all Americans to ask ourselves what role racism plays in fueling anti-immigrant sentiment, perhaps it's time to ask ourselves just how racist it really is.

The Facts

In the fall of 1992, the year Donald Trump was elected president, President Clinton signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act which gave amnesty to immigrants who had committed crimes, immigrated legally from El Salvador in the 1970s, or came later from Mexico. Trump has been quick to point out that these were very simple policies that simply opened the door for all immigrants to immigrate to this country and the American people. Trump explained that they were simply giving ""back"" and making Americans feel part of the great melting pot.

In 2014, when Hillary Clinton first came on the national scene, we should be reminded, along with many Republicans, that Clinton had spoken out on a number of issues concerning racial bias in the criminal justice system and how race played an important role in criminal behavior. In 1994, during Bill Clinton's first term as governor of Arkansas, he had vetoed legislation that would have provided state funding for affirmative action and employment practices. And as we know, Clinton made a decision in 2005 to create a system that granted citizenship to those convicted of felonies before the age of 16.

As we've come to expect from many candidates who vow to end racism, from John Kasich and the Republican candidates who have been running on their promises to remove immigration barriers, but for a presidential contender who has made statements on the campaign trail about enforcing the gun laws of our country, it is certainly possible that these policies and the people who support them are racist in nature and are part of a broader, ongoing pattern of racism that the Democrats have historically employed to benefit themselves politically. After all, it has been a longtime tradition to allow people on the other side of the political aisle to cast doubt on what is good for America, and that is a pattern that has a long history even if Donald Trump has not followed it up in his own campaign.

"MASS EXODUS FROM DEMOCRAT Party In Liberal Massachusetts…TRUMP Effect? Yeah about that whole Trump not matching up to Hillary in the general election thing If there is a mass exodus from the Democrat party, who will be left to vote for the Benghazi liar? Thousands of Massachusetts Democrats have denounced their party affiliations since January 1 to jump across  the aisle and vote for Hillary as we saw in 2012 and again last night. The Democrats, if you really want to count how many members are switching over each year who have voted Republican and who were Democrats in the past, are about 10 times smaller than the Republicans.

I do not think we should be concerned in 2016 that Bernie Sanders supporters would vote for Hillary Clinton. They really don't. But if they do, why do we need to look at them as voters?

We need to recognize that these progressives are the same people the Left is trying to take care of in 2016 with what they call the radical Left, which has become radical in the progressive movement since January 1, 2016. What they need in 2016 to solve their problem of finding enough votes for Hillary and get her elected is a new identity politics that has a radical spin. That's what I think most Americans want. It's also what the Democratic party has done under Joe Biden so far and Hillary has followed their lead by staying in the progressive fold. People are waking up to it.

"It Happened: Personal Notes From A Young Chicago Cubs Fan Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo stepped up to the microphone during the World Series rally in Grant Park and choked up, as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the 38-year-old catcher David Ross, who was a mentor to him. Rizzo,  who is 33, then talked about playing in the postseason in 2004, the year Ross lost his leg during Hurricane Katrina. Ross will continue to have a special place in his heart.

On Thursday, Rizzo appeared on ""Good Morning America"" and talked about that moment. Ross, he said, was ""a man of faith,"" and he's spent time with him, on tours around the world, as a young man. ""He made the decision on both sides of your life,"" Rizzo said. ""He gave his life, his wealth, his family and his future to fulfill God's plan. He saved his son, his wife and his future. No one can take that away from him. It's what makes him special. When David was sick last fall, Anthony had that right there.""

Rizzo went on to say he had seen a lot of things in his life in the months before David was taken away. He watched his dad make baseball his ""life,"" his mom and daughter play with the New York Giants of the majors, and the Cubs of the National League. He also worked at a youth baseball tournament in a Chicago park this summer. Those memories filled him; Ross is a friend and mentor all the same.

""David is my coach, my role model,"" Rizzo said. ""He's a coach who made a decision to serve God and serve others. And he's made me feel that I can be like David, too.""

Then something special happened last year, and Rizzo had a special way of telling it.

When Ross was diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkin lymphoma in August 2014, the Cubs decided it was time to bring him to the team in place of a healthy Cole Hamels, who was scheduled to start again in 2014. Their other option was not taking his place, because of a shoulder injury.

In a story by the Chicago Sun-Times, Rizzo broke down in tears, and he went on to describe how a visit the day before he was diagnosed made him realize all the possibilities he could still have. He said he felt a surge of love and energy, which made what would be an unlikely relationship seem like something that wouldn't be out of the ordinary. It was like taking a breath of fresh air, he said.

The same feeling he got that Aug. 18, 2012 -- to play for his friend and mentor, his father, and to do what would finally be right for him and",1

But the banks are continuing to take on billions and billions of dollars from federal aid programs without even taking a moment to ask themselves what they can reasonably expect to get over their bailout in terms of getting their businesses back. There's been a massive increase in money that's being pumped into the economy because it's the biggest payday and credit card payday ever. It's really just a matter of who controls the purse strings of this country and it's the banks who are not asking themselves as many questions as people might realize. It's still not fully clear why they're going in on these large purchases, but there's been so much hype about these big purchases that have occurred. Those big purchases, like the $4.5-billion purchase from JPMorgan in May, which was made without any public disclosure, I think are completely inappropriate because we have a problem as the American people that no one has ever seen before, a massive criminal organization that could really be a threat to the people of the United States. It's a serious problem, in my opinion, whether you prefer it to be a financial crisis or a financial crisis involving a terrorist attack. -Why do you think banks are taking so much more money in loans on this scale, why is all of this so worrisome even though it happened, as far as banks go? It's not a bank problem. They could take a loan and write off a loan as just business loans without even asking questions. There's no way they're going to give away money to these illegal activities. I find it quite fascinating that you're saying all of this. I think, I mean I don't believe you, but I'm certainly not against banks taking a large portion of the losses due to this huge purchase they did, although a lot of taxpayers are concerned about this because they've had enough losses and they've had to take huge bail",1
"MEDIA WON’T SHOW VIDEO Of Trump Telling Matt Lauer David Duke Is A “Bigot” and A “Racist…IGNORES HILLARY’S Ties To Former KKK Leader, Democrat Senator Robert Byrd It is awfully ironic how the liberals are bashing President Trump for placing blame on both sides for the violence in the Charlottesville incident and not condemning just the white supremacists, considering they conveniently overlooked Hillary and Obama s close friendship with former KKK member, Robert Byrd.Following the Charlottesville incident  the left blamed Donald Trump for the events, while demanding an answer from our president. The leftist are even saying Trump's words about how he is going to find out from ""both sides"" of the protest are actually words used by President Trump who wants to keep the peace so he can save his reputation.

""It's really important to me personally and to the University. I don't say it to be annoying—I say it because it's important to me.""

The job is one of many, says Kevin, the company sales vice president and vice president of technology services. But on this particular morning, Kevin is focused on something much bigger and more consequential: the future of UMF's campus. The campus, known as the ""Garden of Eden,"" is home to about 10,000 UMF students and visitors, many of whom live in stately apartments that are about the same size and shape as the campus' main campus.

But if you know anything about UF's past, you know that the university faces a big future. The building the university uses now for its buildings and campus—the Memorial Union—is nearing completion. The University of Miami Hospital, with nearly 2,000 campus residents, is slated to open next summer as UMF's first permanent health system (the University of Florida is a close second).

""I don't want to talk about the buildings and that or the new buildings,"" says Kevin, who's recently relocated to Miami. ""It's just the future.""

But when UMF's financial woes first exploded in the mid-2000s, Kevin knew something was out of order. If he tried to do it again today, he admits, ""the financials wouldn't help.""

UMF students, students, and visitors often live close to each other through UF's network systems. Students share common areas and shared services for campus life such as cafeteria servers and security guards for the university's health system. Student housing is common and shared from the student-to-student level—and is often shared by all UF students, who don't necessarily live at one another's houses.

The student union, as Kevin puts it, is like ""an armory for your people."" People that are students and people that are residents of UM",1
"VIDEO : FBI SOURCES SAY INDICTMENT LIKELY FOR CLINTON – TruthFeed VIDEO : FBI SOURCES SAY INDICTMENT LIKELY FOR CLINTON VIDEO : FBI SOURCES SAY INDICTMENT LIKELY FOR CLINTON Videos By TruthFeedNews November 3, 2016 BRET BAIER: Here’s the deal: We talked to two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations. One: The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more  serious than this has been made out to be. The FBI was already aware of those discussions; they had the transcripts of the meetings, or the meetings themselves, which would indicate who was invited to meetings and who wasn't. The FBI agents who were there were also familiar with the material they were looking at. Now, there is also the fact that at least some of the money was routed through one of these intermediary companies, as they call them, and that, again, all of those details matter a lot. The two separate sources told us they'd heard about all of this before this hearing, and what we were told by the FBI is that they are looking at whether it was directed to Mrs. Clinton through her State Department. Two: This wasn't just a small charity. This was an organization with millions of dollars in assets. They knew about it. They knew what all of these entities were doing—just like we know about other corrupt charities that have gotten large donations from people. The two sources—not everyone in the FBI knew or told on all of this. But people in the FBI knew about it. And so what's the point of these statements, if people didn't know? A former head of the FBI's New York field division at the time told us this before the testimony began. It has only deepened our concerns about these meetings on behalf of the Clintons, because of the way they operated. This was not a charity. But then we found out that they gave huge donations to the Clinton Foundation just before she became Secretary of State. There have been other corrupt organizations and corrupt foundations, as well. And as these two sources said, there were meetings at which they were not asked by the Foundation if they had received special treatment. These are meetings that would have taken place at a Clinton Foundation meeting. So, why wasn't asked? What is this evidence? They should have known about it and they shouldn't be surprised, but they weren't. 3:00: Hillary Clinton (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRIAN PEREZ: And before Mr. Comey, can you just respond to this question: How did someone who has been under investigation for the longest time possibly become the person in the news when this came out, and then to be the subject of one of the most powerful inquiries of her life? 5:02: THE PRESIDENT: I think that's an excellent question.

"OOPS! ABSOLUTELY NO ONE SHOWED UP For NYC Debut Of Beyonce’s Clothing Line…Is Her RADICAL Super Bowl Performance To Blame? I was in Nordstrom yesterday when our salesperson asked my teenage daughter and I if we had seen the new Ivy Park collection by Beyonce yet? My response to her was no, as I turned to my daughter and told her I wouldn t buy anything for her from that  site…

Well, she did make a purchase today that I couldn't resist. What was the deal? A pink top? I was thrilled, and even though I didn't buy her an expensive shirt, I felt like the purchase (a pink top I think it was) was worth every penny. It was a really nice piece, and now that I'm trying to shop online, it's always a good idea to find a designer with whom you are comfortable. I bought The Velveteen Rope, but she purchased an identical top: The one from the Velveteen Collection (which I highly recommend!).

Why do you think The Fashion Institute is so influential?

I think they help the small retailers in their market by showing what is affordable for women and what is going to look like if you are willing to pay the price.

Why are you a product owner? What challenges were you faced at product launch?

I'm probably not the most prolific product designer on this website (I actually only have an 8 year marketing career), but the challenges I encounter from day to day are very valuable. I've learned a lot from doing product launches over the course of nearly 2 decades; and with a bit of time and money, I can learn a thing or two everytime I do product launches. Here's a few of the things I've learned.

The biggest challenge I've run into is that products look different every product launch, and it's hard to predict what will work. What works for an iPhone may not work for a dress I'm wearing to my mom's birthday party. A dress can be great for men, but it definitely won't make you look like a man in your shirt. This doesn't mean that the product can't be fun to wear, to dress, to have on your arm. It just means that there will be differences in how you look each day.

For example, a day, I may wear a blazer, a coat, a dress, and a pair of jeans, all looking absolutely gorgeous to the folks I'm going out with. Yet I may be wearing the wrong jeans or not having the right amount of style in each one. How do I know which to wear which day?

The same thing should apply to the other products I wear. When I'm dressing, every part, every piece of my body should look as unique and fabulous as possible. However, if I'm wearing a pair of jeans for my wedding day, how",1
" Jewish Family’s Hanukkah Destroyed By Vandalism; Trump Supporters Make It Worse (IMAGE) A Chandler, Arizona family awoke early one morning to see that the Menorah sculpture on their lawn had been vandalized and turned into a swastika. Clearly, this was bad enough for the Jewish family, but when Fox 10 Phoenix posted the picture, things got really ugly. Not surprisingly, Donald Trump  took offense to it, calling both the Chandler men ""a disgrace to AMERICA.""

So the entire Fox 10 crew got down in the weeds and spent most of the morning poking around to see if anything was amiss:

But then things escalated, and the entire town was left baffled as to what exactly was going on:

While the man behind the hate-crime piece would later confess that he knew nothing about it until now, he now seems far less concerned with his public image as president of the United States; and even Fox 10 wasn't sure what to think until the next morning.

Trump has not only made the anti-Semitic thing look like an isolated incident (he once once retweeted ""A lot of the people that have been upset by it are bad people, too,"" a story Trump has admitted lying about in at least four of his eight debates), he has also spent two days at the center of a media firestorm over his response to a protester's remarks about President Obama.

In an experiment with 6,600 students, researchers found students who were exposed to pro-choice and pro-gun speech, or to pro–gay and anti–abortion materials, used more offensive speech. In the absence of harmful speech, the children did best on a computer task in which they had to guess what a person was saying in a random combination of 15 randomly drawn sentences. A similar study published in 2010 found that students in schools that were less ""harmful"" (pro-choice and pro-gun) and more liberal (pro-choice and pro-gay) used less language than students who were less ""harmful"" (pro-sex offenders) and more liberal (pro-sex offenders).

A study published in the October issue of the journal Educational Psychology by sociologists and educators Richard A. Varela, Michael M. Hartzinger, Edward L. Deutsch, and Thomas E. Laughlin (a co-author of ""The Harmful Speech Toolkit: What It Is, Where It Comes From, and Why We Need It"" and a consultant in the psychology of political language practice, and a doctoral student in the psychology of political communication practice) finds that students who were exposed to pro-choice and",1
"TAKE IT DOWN! BLM Supporter, Dem Congressman Hangs COP-HATING, Race-Baiting Art-Work In U.S. Capitol Building A piece of art depicting cops as animals that are killing minorities that has no business hanging in our US Capitol building Artistic expression, or one congressman s political statement masquerading as student art? A very offensive depiction of police hands in the U.S. Capitol complex, and Missouri Rep. William  ""Mo"" Speer's speech calling police ""animalists"" has sparked a debate about what the U.S. is supposed to be honoring with its Capitol buildings and monuments. Speer was speaking of the need for ""inclusive representation,"" but his comments suggested, according to many Americans, the artistry is in the artwork. He cited the ""surgical knife"" that was created on the Capitol grounds in 2011 to symbolize the murder of 14 people by police on Black Friday. Speer's comments prompted a backlash from people and politicians including then Gov. Jay Nixon, who took issue with the depiction of the police officer as a ""snake"" and wondered why Speer had taken a stance like that. While Speer said he didn't feel there was a place for artists ""to say what I did was wrong, wrong-headed, or just offensive to some Americans,"" he said he did ""not feel it was right"" to condemn those expressing their own artistic thoughts as he did. ""They do not control my artistic expression, and my artistic expression controls my actions,"" Speer said.

"Our Landfill Economy Leave a reply Charles Hugh Smith – Correspondent Bart D. (Australia) captured the entire global economy in three words: The Landfill Economy. Stuff is manufactured, energy is consumed shipping it somewhere, consumers buy it and shortly thereafter it ends up as garbage in the landfill. This is of course the  opposite of what we were told all these years – or more accurately, a lie – that we weren't responsible for much of the planet's environmental damage. It used to be true from the very start that if something went wrong you would be forced to recycle it and the earth's atmosphere would continue functioning normally for quite some time. It's really become all but impossible to recover from the environmental effects of fossil fuels and their impact has had so much devastating effect on our climate, our food production and our ability to adapt to changing climates. It's amazing just how much we're doing and what we're doing with our time and energy.

The story began with some emails from a former staff member (who I'll refer to solely as ""Chris"") who told me to be careful in how I wrote my columns, or else it would not go down well. It's hard to say what really made me go to Chris, what spurred his e-mail request, or how he felt about the article. It's possible he's a liar. It's also possible maybe it makes no difference one way or the other since there's no proof of anything between what I wrote in my e-mail and what was published in the piece. I'll take his word for it. But since you asked, it's my own view.

For context, I wrote a few columns on the new Call of Duty game, World at War, in June 2009, when the game's design team at EA made a video called ""How to Write a Good Co-op Strategy Game."" I thought that the players were the ones who mattered, since the ""good side"" would be the one with the greatest strategy. As such, it was written to appeal to a different audience. In Chris' letter to me, he said that he thought the column wasn't done properly, because ""the players and other players don't understand all or part of the structure it is written for.""

" One Of the Biggest Geniuses Ever Issues A Warning About Donald Trump Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking is internationally renowned for his insights into space, time, and the fundamental nature of the universe and how it was formed. Despite all this knowledge, Hawking is confounded by the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.For Stephen Hawking, the world-renowned expert in theoretical physics and cosmology, the success  of the Republican election is an indication of how things in this era of polarization are likely to head. Hawking believes a Trump presidency could lead to a ""superstorm of global catastrophic events as people fear war and fear the collapse of societies.""This comes after Trump insulted President Obama for being born overseas and suggesting that if Hillary Clinton were elected, she would immediately appoint a Supreme Court Justice who would give Americans the right to shoot her in the back in order to protect ourselves from terrorist.The latest controversy to rock political opinion is Hawking's belief that the American population would stop investing in the nation's national security even if they could pay off their war debts. But, according to Dr. Hawking, it would be hard to stop that interest from occurring as a result of Trump's comments and policies, because even if you're an investment banker like Donald Trump or Goldman Sachs, you'll want to invest what you can in your investments in order to avoid the risk of being bankrupt.Hawking believes that many people in politics are simply ""crony capitalists"" that are too afraid to admit mistakes when they do them, and when they do, the result is nothing so they blame other people instead.He says that when the global economy collapses, it will be easy for many leaders to blame the wrong problem, and even if Hillary Clinton is elected, things could go so terribly wrong that most people will just accept Trump as President instead.While Hawking doesn't believe Trump's rhetoric about Muslims is likely to stop terrorists, he says that the threat of terrorist attacks will likely continue for many decades to come. Hawking believes that people who can't handle things now will eventually lose control in the future.He says that people often fail to understand the risks of the modern world because they're in bed with politicians. It wasn't always that way, with all the financial power held by our nation, however, as our country has seen unprecedented economic growth, as well as the increase of technology used to create our economy. The technology of our times have enabled us to take care of ourselves as a nation and have become less susceptible to economic failures.However, he says that we should be proud of our freedom, and don't have to worry about losing our freedoms because of political and ideological differences.<|endoftext|>New details about the death and burial of the late comedian George Carlin remain out of the record -- but one of his friends says it's possible it's true.

But experts say that would increase the risk of mass migrations, especially in areas at high elevation, when climate change-caused sea level rise can increase the rise of the seas up to a meter beneath the earth's surface.

The United Nations estimates that climate change, especially when combined with increasing sea levels, would be damaging global agriculture. The average area of an average-sized farm, for instance, would rise by more than 40 percent between the 1970s and 2015, the World Meteorological Organization said in 2005.

A major portion of North America would likely be underwater to sea by midcentury, although more inland than in the past because of rising seas. The oceans are projected to swell by more than half by 2100.

""The risk of increased droughts and other hazards associated with rising sea levels, including floods, storms and coastal hazards, outweighs any benefits from slowing growth in carbon dioxide emissions,"" the W.M.O. says.

"LOL! OBAMA WARNS VOTERS Donald Trump Is Unvetted, Unserious…”This is not a reality show” Says the guy who was a Jr. Senator and Community Organizer prior to becoming President of the United States. And who can forget our selfie President?And then there s the famous Nelson Mandela funeral selfie:President Obama skewered Donald Trump on Friday, warning that the Republicans presumptive nominee isn t serious  for the Oval Office. While it is difficult to call anything Trump's campaign slogan when his campaign was literally a joke, it's refreshing to see an Obama endorsement. This is not to say that Obama is not in favor of Trump if they see eye-to-eye, but he did call on Republicans to rally behind Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. And although Hillary's name comes up in a lot of his rallies – and it should, really – Barack Obama clearly sees enough reason to make up with Bernie Sanders of the Democratic Party for Hillary. But in the end, I have to agree with Obama on a few things. This candidate is not an authentic American citizen and that is absolutely fine. But as one of the people whose name is listed as an endorsement on Obama's website, it would be extremely stupid for Obama to publicly attack Trump and refuse to endorse Hillary. That way, Hillary won't have to answer for all the hate that she and her supporters have stirred up against her throughout the election cycle. Obama also mentioned Donald Trump's comments regarding women, and how the President thinks that we should stop teaching girls to be role models. Obama was also right that Trump doesn't have enough experience in the Oval Office to be president. And, while Obama does see more reason than Clinton to give Trump a chance, Hillary Clinton is still the far superior candidate. As for why Obama would support Clinton, I suppose his reasons for not backing her are pretty obvious. Hillary has the vastest network of campaign surrogates and fundraisers in politics, including her wife, former New York Mayor Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton has the most money of any politician in U.S. history, making her a formidable candidate. As one of the highest ranking Democratic politicians in the country Hillary has proven capable and qualified in leading her Party to victory, a feat that hasn't been accomplished in 20 years. So, in fact, I actually don't buy Obama's statement that Hillary's platform is better than his platform. There are a heck of a lot of good things about Bernie Sanders' platform (which includes, amongst other things, raising the minimum wage, free college tuition, and banning fracking), so Hillary has proven herself to be a viable nominee for the Democratic Party. But if Obama endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, then what exactly does Obama think of the Republican Platform? Do we really think that Obama's endorsement for Mrs. Clinton would make him a better Commander in Chief than Hillary Clinton? And does Obama really think a presidential nominee can be trusted",1

WASHINGTON (AP) — A group of high school freshmen who were allegedly threatened with death by their classmates is seeking a jury trial on charges that they tried to kidnap and murder a high-school classmate but were unsuccessful in doing so.

The U.S. attorney's office in St. Louis County says 18-year-old Matthew Mazzullon faces 11 counts of conspiracy to commit abduction, murder or attempted kidnapping, with additional charges available and said prosecutors will allege others on the charges, including those he allegedly killed. The 18th-grader is being held without bail. He did not return a call seeking comment.

The alleged conspiracy took place in a middle school that was part of a single-teacher district. According to a lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri, the defendants used fake threats, including one that threatened to ""cut it off"" and another that threatened to kill Mazzullon.

According to the lawsuit, the school made a list of all the pupils that were in the school at the time and gave it to a parent. The parents reported finding the list of pupils several days later and alerted school workers who checked in with administrators. None of the children were able to talk to authorities and the district was forced to close schools Wednesday.

Officials say the incident could impact many other schools in nearby St. Louis that operate schools by single-sex teams.<|endoftext|>There's a lot of information out there about why people in power are constantly trying to destroy your privacy in the name of national security.

More from GlobalPost: This Is How Women Say they Are Fighting Back Against Donald Trump<|endoftext|>A former head of Britain s secret intelligence agency has said the U.K.-led alliance against IS is now ""fiasco"" and wants it to be abolished.

Andrew Parker, who headed MI6 , the domestic security agency, suggested the terror group has proven ""difficult to beat"" despite the scale of the threat it poses.

""One of the things we can now say is that IS is now a 'fiasco' not a 'fait accompli',"" Parker told a conference in Germany. ""It was a good idea to send aircraft from RAF Akrotiri to help defeat this group but the British response has been woeful.""

Parker also warned against the ""cute"" concept of sending hundreds of specially trained British troops to battle IS militants on foreign soil, warning there is a ""big risk"" of a similar mistake on British soil.

MI6's deputy chief was forced out last year over a slew of corruption allegations. A further report from the British government said Parker was not being allowed to return to work unless police can confirm whether he still remains employed after he was sacked last year over corruption claims.

British authorities did not respond to a request for comment.

Parker was the first Briton to be fired as director of MI6 by U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday but since then there have been numerous allegations of mistreatment by officials who were the subject of internal inquiry investigations.

Earlier this month Parker also announced that a ""new level of intelligence cooperation"" was being planned, while urging ""all countries"" to share information on the group's activities and plans. Earlier in the week it emerged that President Trump had been briefed on plans by British spy agency GCHQ to develop and share information on a ""precautionary mode"" against IS.

Parker also told the conference: ""I don s opinion that intelligence sharing is good for the United Kingdom but not for UK security.

""So that there is going to be a level of cooperation that is not too antagonistic or at a low level…and it is not something we should be doing when there are so many competing challenges.""

"Dems sue GOP over Trump's 'rigged' complaints Dems sue GOP over Trump's 'rigged' complaints Claim argument designed to suppress vote in minority communities Published: 2 hours ago (CNN) The Democratic National Committee is suing the Republican National Committee for aiding GOP nominee Donald Trump as he argues that the presidential election is “rigged,” claiming that Trump’s argument  has the potential to tip the election, according to a Politico report . The lawsuit was filed in federal court last week in Virginia. ""We have a legitimate complaint about how the DNC improperly worked to help Donald Trump,"" DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz tweeted Thursday. ""In effect, the committee was facilitating collusion [with Trump] in violation of the law and the Constitution."" It's the latest in a string of high-profile, high-profile Democrats who have called out Republicans for participating in a ""rigged election,"" while attacking Clinton for appearing soft during her campaign and for being less interested in politics. On Wednesday, Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri tweeted: ""We're filing a lawsuit in federal court in Virginia on behalf of tens of thousands of Democratic voters facing real danger -- rigged elections, fake news -- so people can vote at the same time."" Palmieri's tweet was accompanied by an image of a large black sign that reads ""PEDESTRIAN RIGGING."" The letter from Trump, signed ""Donald J. Trump,"" was the target of a slew of media calls to address concerns. During an MSNBC town hall Thursday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush slammed Democrats for the letter and its implications, calling them ""disgusting"" for doing so. Bush also called for ""a special prosecutor to investigate this. It's time for law and order.""

Seth Rich's murder has fueled many conspiracy theories, including one recently posted online by a right-wing website that attributes the case to a plot by Democratic Party members to make Hillary Clinton the Democratic presidential nominee if Rich were not found murdered years ago. The theory that Rich was murdered by two groups of Democrats to keep their candidate out of the White House was posted on the conspiracy website, InfoWars by a right-wing writer Daniel Joseph Wright Jr. The theory was apparently posted from a Reddit account known for posting stories that may or may not be true and has received a large amount of traction on the conspiracy website. While most conspiracy theories can be researched, it's important to understand that this particular theory appears to be based on a relatively thin argument based on one very small statement made by Republican National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. While Wasserman Schultz may have provided support to a political party, it was not to undermine Donald Trump and his campaign, despite the right wing's assertion that it was this position.<|endoftext|>I would like to make a quick post about one of the things one has to be careful about.

"Comment on Scientists Find A Plant That Could Treat Diabetes & Kill Cancer Cells by Scientists Find A Plant That Could Treat Diabetes & Kill Cancer Cells – Collective Evolution | SFO More recently, bitter melon juice was shown to kill pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in mice in a study done by the University of Colorado. Considering the results were seen in both in vitro and in vivo tests, the effectiveness of bitter melon juice in treating pancreatic cancer, and  in that case, are very much in question.

One interesting feature related to bitter melon juice is the use of it for treating irritability, which is also part of being an effective therapy for cancer. In addition, it may reduce the risk of stomach cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The study is currently being carried out in two centers in the United States and the Netherlands. In order to carry out the new study researchers believe they will have to obtain approval of both American and Dutch authorities. However, Dr. Pangin thinks that bitter melon juice is more effective. Dr. Pangin adds that bitter melon juice can also be used to treat pain and other ailments in humans such as a condition called systemic lupus erythematosus.

Dr. Pangin says he was able to obtain his permission for a research into the use of bitter melon juice for treating cancer earlier this year as well. Dr. Pangin notes that in the past few years, the FDA is approving the use of ""coral products"" and the industry in the United States already uses bitter melon juice in the manufacture of cosmetics and some of the popular products.

According to Dr. Pangin, the bitter melon juice used in the Dutch trial was created with a specific ingredient which had been synthesized from the natural fruit fruit called hudud. This ingredient provides an acidic taste that can be a painkiller, he adds. Dr. Pangin says that when bitter melon juice can be used as a pain killer rather than a ""pain killer in itself"" its potential potential applications for cancer patients are enormous.

One of Dr. Pangin's friends, Dr. Aydin Danso, was awarded the 2011 American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) Lifetime Leadership Award for his work which is aimed at improving the health of the elderly and the elderly and improving the quality of life in the developing world through effective health care for the elderly.<|endoftext|>Image copyright PA Image caption The man has denied charges of indecent assault and assault by penetration

Not true!The press decided that the president  is no longer in office and that the Democrats are ruining everything.That is all the press knows about him and there are some in his side that actually believe so much that they actually believe that he is actually alive and just going against them all!The media was the ones who initially reported that Melania was ""in her dressing room at their Mar-a-Lago resort"". Not true!Melania and Barron are still at the Mar-a-Lago property.They only leave it once you enter their house (there are no privacy policies). The president did not come to their home to visit them personally but Melania did visit him last week.

"THIS Test Will Tell If You Are An Indigo, A Crystal Or A Rainbow Child! Many people believe that there has been a wave of individuals being born in order to change the old ‘Iron’ and industrial way of life to more ‘enlightened’ and spiritual. You’ve probably heard about ‘ Indigo Children ’ and ‘ Lightworkers ’ across the internet. Lightworkers are just a consequence  of the transformation of society. In this view, the current state of society is an inevitable consequence of what has happened to humans over the millennia, whether it is from human slavery, the rise of industrialism, disease and disease‒ or other environmental issues. Although it was not always so. You don't have to believe in this explanation to have some interest in ‘Indigo Children′, ‘Lightworkers', or ‘Lightways’. People have been following their dream for ages, and have created ‘indigenous cultures across the oceans. There is truth in these stories. ‘Indigo Children’ are not children, but descendants of the original inhabitants of Earth-II ‐ with a certain amount of interspecies mixing occurring. ‘Lightworkers’ are a remnant of humankind, a remnant from preindustrial times which were largely absent from the mainstream consciousness of the majority of Humanity ‒ but they did exist, and are among us. The ‘Lightworker’ concept has been around for a very long time, and it deserves its own dedicated website.

The ‘Lightwork’ movement has grown substantially since 2010, however, due to the ‘spiritual shift‧ movement, which is being led by and inspired by the ‘lightworker’. ‘Spirituality is different and unique from what the ‘Darkworker’ movement has. ‘Indigo Children’ believes in the spirit of the ‘Lightworker’‚, but its vision is still a bit different from ‐Darkworker’‚s ‒Indigo Children’‚. The ‘spirituality of Lightworkers does not believe in the ‘Indigo’‚ ‒spirituality ‒that ‐Darkworker’‚ used in its ‘spirituality ‒with ‐Darkworker’ ‚–. ‘Indigo Children’ believes in ‐Lightwork’‚ spirituality, which we call ‘Wiccan’. Lightworking has many adherents throughout the world, who are interested in‘the‒life in ‐Woods’‚ of a planet called ‘Wood’‚, one of the four ‘Lightworks ‚ systems.

" FL Pastor Targets Neighbor With Nazi Flag Display Over Boating Laws (IMAGE) Naples, Florida pastor John Gursoy is outraged over new boating regulations in the gated community where he lives. The new regulations include limiting the number of boats that can be parked at one dock and raising the age of boat operators from 13 to 14. Volunteer board members for the  group said that this violates their First Amendment Rights. They are asking the beach community to join them by telling Florida State's Department of Environmental Protection and US Coast Guard officials to immediately enforce the regulations.

A Florida resident reported that a group called ""The Big Orange Boat Show"" in the gated community was violating state boating regulations by allowing boats to park along its promenade. They wanted to make it clear to parkers that they weren't breaking the law. The boats are allowed to sit right along the promenade so long they are not interfering with it. But now they can no longer sit at one dock. While some residents are worried about what this might mean for their vacation, Gursoy sees the regulations as an unwarranted attempt to impose his religious ideology on the free and civil rights of others. ""We're in violation of federal law,"" says Gursoy, ""What are you going to think, God, if you're sitting on one dock and letting boats park there? What will you think if you have two boats parked right next to each other? And when I point that out to people in the boat club, I sometimes get one say, 'Hey that's nice, but you can't do that.' Then others turn around, say, 'What's the problem? We're all just doing what we like.'""

Gursoy added that his group has been trying to have the regulations enforced on all boats for around a year now. They have had to fight with the Department of Environmental Protection to even obtain a permit to park their boats along the promenade. ""I've been trying their case for about two years now,"" Gursoy explained to the Florida Times Union. ""The only thing we've been able to persuade is that they don't allow for the use of boats that sit on docks longer than one foot. We're able, but not allowed because that just means boat clubs are giving away those boats just to stand there for a week and give them away.""

Gursoy says the regulations are ""un-American"" and ""completely ridiculous,"" and that he has been fighting to bring the state's agency to heel. As a result, Gursoy says these restrictions are going to cost him business. ""We've gone through all their regulations. We've done everything,"" he explained. ""There is one small boat on Lake Dania that was approved, a small boat that we have now on Lake Okeechobee. We have to ask them",1
"TRUMP HITS BACK After Cowgirl Congresswoman Trashes Him Over Words Said to Grieving Widow The left is going ballistic over supposed words said by President Trump to a grieving military widow. President Trump made a call to Myeshia Wilson that s been turned into a political football by the left to make Trump out to be crazy . Wilson s husband was killed in  action in Niger last week. President Trump said at the time that she should have been allowed to get out of harm's way and let the family decide what to do. I am very disappointed in the way that the President has handled this so far, especially after we first reported on it . We are all Americans at heart so it is sad that Obama and his administration seem to be taking the heat for comments that were made on a condolence call by a deceased soldier . We want to move away from the political football that is playing out on Facebook right now. I strongly believe that President Trump should be held to a higher standard in regards to his personal conduct when it comes to families and the deaths of their loved ones. It is very, very unfortunate that the President has lost some credibility by doing something like that and it is really unfortunate that he is giving the impression that this is not just about him or about America or this country or the Constitution. The President did express his condolences to the family and to the soldier, but at this point it seems to be more politics than anything else. So if I could only find an explanation how a grown man can be so ignorant of military realities in Iraq and Niger while having such a wonderful daughter, I would love to know it. The President of the United States was so naive and so naive as to make such a comment. We know from reports by the Pentagon that the woman who President Trump is speaking to doesn ould be coming back home soon and his statement about the president offering condolences to the family makes it sound like that is what this is about. The President said it was an honor that the family of Sgt. La David Johnson had reached out to him after hearing about his service and it would be a heartbreaking thing for the family to hear. But it is also true. The President was saying that he felt very, very badly about the situation and this was just another example of it.

We asked White House Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders what the president meant, which she told CNN is the President's words. The White House then released the following statement:

""My son was one of seven American soldiers killed in Niger last week by a suspected terrorist. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and the soldiers involved, as well as with all of those we are all deeply saddened by today's tragic events in Niger. The President has said many times that President Trump will keep people safe, and to suggest otherwise is simply false.""

"2 Reminders to Ignore the ""Trump is Doomed"" Polls 2 Reminders to Ignore the ""Trump is Doomed"" Polls We've recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the ""Trump is Doomed"" polling saga. A few days ago, the media was loudly trumpeting that Hillary's victory was inevitable, that the polls were in and she was going to ignore  them. But the polls weren't going to be missed. That was the point, because while the polls might be wrong, the reality was far from certain. We still knew, as does everyone, that Hillary would win Pennsylvania because it is one of Obama's strongest states, and voters there are strongly pro-Sanders. Clinton's biggest challenge is that Sanders voters are more likely to back Clinton in the primary because they think she is more qualified. But their own polling suggests voters should expect an increase in Clinton's support in the general election. She also has less room to grow in the poll. And while we shouldn't assume that a large portion of the Sanders surge will show up in the polls, it's hard to miss the possibility of it. The first example involved Donald Trump's win last night. It was a blowout — especially in the Electoral College, given that his margin narrowed the way most of the states were supposed to — but we still know a candidate does not win a decisive electoral vote in a landslide. Even if Clinton wins Pennsylvania comfortably, it's hard to tell that it will have a major impact on the election. On the contrary, an upset victory in Ohio — even if that wins an upset against Trump, who has done well only in states where Clinton lost the popular vote — is unlikely to make much difference in the presidential election. For instance, if Sanders wins a few smaller states like Nevada and New Hampshire, and if Wisconsin goes for Trump in the presidential election, he will still win the Electoral College, and his margin in the Electoral College will not change. So, as Trump's win in Michigan was almost unexpected, it was no surprise he did better in that state than any other. Another example was the news this morning of the Florida Democratic primary results. It's a very odd state where the polls show Democrats in good shape, but where Sanders did better than expected in the polls. And although Sanders won by more than three percentage points in Florida, Florida is not a state that votes for Democrats regularly. In other words, it's unlikely either Clinton or Sanders will win. More important, Florida is going to decide the election. It's worth noting that it's one of the biggest states in the country that has a relatively large black population. There are now six state Senate seats up for grabs in the district, and if Sanders can take a handful or more African-American voters, he could have more than 20 Democratic seats that are up for grabs in 2018. He has the opportunity to win in Florida, and he clearly",1
"BUSTED: The Oh So Objective ABC News Chief Anchor, George Stephanopoulous Made Huge Donation To Clinton Foundation Just like Hillary Stephanopoulos claims it was an honest mistake not to disclose his donations to the corrupt Clinton slush fund ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos has given $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation in recent years, charitable contributions that he did not publicly disclose while reporting on the Clintons  during the presidential campaigns.

Since the early 1990's the Clinton family has repeatedly profited by selling and profiting from their lucrative and influential ties to corrupt nations, particularly those controlled by the U.S. government (primarily the U.S. military-intelligence complex), foreign governments and corporations.


For instance, the Clinton Foundation has awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts, many designed to benefit and serve corporations and governments that have committed numerous violations of human rights, international trade and other non-progressive economic and corporate policies that the United States and most of the world have condemned. These governments include the Gulf regimes, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Libya, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras and Venezuela, to name just a few. These include countries in which they have been engaged in widespread torture and the murder of dissidents and prisoners, or at worst used as tools in a war for the benefit of those governments and corporatist profiteering interests.

The Clinton Group – The Private-Company that Loves the Iraq War

This is not to say that the Clinton Group's role as top financier of the Iraq war must be excused by their own record. The Clinton family's corporate interests have also been the largest and most significant backer of some of America's most murderous governments, the U.S. military and other governments and foreign corporations that have been the greatest supporters and supporters of the Iraq War.

The Clinton International Group received $2.1 billion in U.S. government contracts after it was formed in April 2002 by former president Bill Clinton and the late Tony Blair as his official and legal adviser. In 2006, Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) took over $100 million from the group's board before it was sold for $500 million to the oil and insurance giant, the Saudi Alwaleed bin Talal, in exchange for the family's role as the charity-crony that bankrolled the wars in Libya and Syria.

The State Department under President Clinton had awarded the State Department in 2003 contracts worth another $6.7 billion and has continued to hand over a further $18 billion in military and financial contracts as part of the ""war on terror"" since the U.S. military began its military onslaught on 9/11.

The U.S. military has committed numerous atrocities, including human rights violations by the U.S. military and the CIA in the Middle East including the torture of torturers and the indiscrim",1
"How U.S. Schools Can Improve Math Education - The Onion - America's Finest News Source Clinton Staff Readies EMP Launch To Disable All Nation’s Electronic Devices NEW YORK—In an effort to prepare for any new revelations that might emerge about her emails during her tenure as secretary of state, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reportedly told her staff Tuesday to ready the launch of several  different kinds of emergency EMP weapons while the nation's electronic devices are on standby. ""I think the right thing to do would be to do all sorts of emergency EMP and EMP-like attacks on the infrastructure and the electronic systems, and then wait to figure it out during the transition,"" Clinton said of her plans to respond if one of those weapons were released prior to November 2016 elections. ""If one did go off, it would be an enormous shock and awe blast to everyone around the world—especially the U.S. government."" ""And it's likely that no one, not even your President, would be ready to handle it if it went off during an election campaign,"" she told her staff, who were reportedly instructed to stockpile ""a lot of EMP-capable high-efficiency EMP weapons"" in case Clinton herself was the victim of an emergency nuclear attack. ""That way if she did make it into the arena, she might need our help in dealing with the fallout, rather than being forced to take shelter in the basement."" Clinton aides went on to warn that if Clinton's private e-mail server was discovered by the United States, any electronic devices would be destroyed immediately as well as any evidence of her server operation. ""All of the electronics will likely be destroyed if you find out she's had any sort of e-mail account,"" one Clinton confidant wrote to his colleague at the state department.

When asked in an interview with Fox Business Network about possible U.S. retaliation for any breach of the country's secure e-mail system, Clinton advisor Neera Tanden stated that she is ""confident that it will not,"" adding, ""We don't know who is doing what, not even Russia.""

I know that's one of the reasons you hate gay people so much; because it's one of the few things they have in common.

Rather, it's that they are two sides of the same coin, and this is the exact opposite side of the coin.

And for anyone who thinks it s okay for Rock to spew this kind of hatred for whites in a video because he  is a comedian, listen up. There are a lot of rich white people like Rock.<|endoftext|>In October, at the last annual conference of the International Olympic Committee, the U.S. team lost its gold medal to Great Britain. Their failure to score from a standstill was perhaps the worst result in Olympic history.

A day later, a video of a U.S. player in a boxing match with British referee Phil Dowd was posted on YouTube. The British referee then proceeded to slam on the boxing glove of U.S. champion Paul Spong, who was knocked down mid-concussion. This made Dowd feel sick, and he called for the umpire's head.

In response, Spong wrote on YouTube, ""I'm getting more and more tired about it from hearing this ... please don't let this get to you. I'm fine but the feeling is just too much. No one should ever be treated like this."" (Read more at The New York Times.)

Here's the full text of Dowd's statement on the video. There's also a transcript. Dowd did not, we are sorry to say, actually call for the referee's head. But we wanted to highlight Dowd's frustration so that other players can get the message.

I, along with every U.S. citizen, have a right to participate fully in the games. Therefore, in view of the following facts:

(1) On Nov. 19, 2014 the U.S. Team defeated Great Britain in the 2012 London Olympics (GB) for their Gold Medal. (read more) (2) During the game, as the U.S. Team was about to attempt to defend a corner, Phil Dowd and a British referee approached Paul Spong and knocked him down. Paul Spong went head-first onto his chest and rolled to the floor. The U.S. Team recovered and scored a tap-out with 4 seconds left in the game.

We all want to know what we want to do and where to go in the year. How do we get everything done? Or where we are headed? A good question is why we do things at all at all in life? And so I will answer it on a topic that I feel very deeply in my heart, I feel like the answer is because we feel it. So now I want to share the lesson I learned while doing my Master's Degree in History of Religion at UCLA and the lessons people have taken from it.

So, why would we want to do these things? But let me start with the simple and clear question ""Why did the people who created the Universe do this?"" and how we can understand it:

First answer: Because we are the result of a God-directed plan. And it's about time! The entire Universe was created on this same foundation. It wasn't even made by another being. It just happens it was made by someone who understood it (or is using it to do something important), to bring it into being, and we as a species need to join the other created parts of the Plan, to help do so. Why? Because it's a plan for the Earth, for our entire evolution, and we as a species are part of it and we must learn to live in harmony there too.

The whole way of life, that of all the living species in the Universe (and this is something that is actually written in all kinds of religions and also has a very important point), is not just about killing and eating things, and building things that are destructive to other beings: it's all about being the best we can (and then some) in harmony and harmonious relationships with these other creators of life who are also just as concerned about these things: they want peace and harmony and",1
"BREAKING: CLOSE AIDE TO BILL CLINTON: “I arranged for $50 million in payments to Bill Clinton” A close aide to Bill Clinton said he arranged for $50 million in payments for the former president, part of a complicated mingling of lucrative business deals and charity work of the Clinton Foundation mapped out in a memo released by WikiLeaks on Wednesday.The report was written by Doug Band,  one half of an ambitious consulting firm with ties to the Clinton family. The firm is currently investigating a report that Clinton could be under investigation by the Justice Department for allegedly ""knowingly giving bribes to foreign governments during his time as Arkansas's chief executive.""A Clinton aide told CNN, ""The Clinton Foundation is an excellent non-profit organization with a great vision for strengthening relationships with countries around the world, as well as providing humanitarian and other assistance to those most in need in underserved parts of the world.""The report indicates that there were $10 million in donations from around the world to the Clinton Foundation from 2007 to December 2013, more than all but one of Bill Clinton's paid speeches from the Clinton Global Initiative.The report, which was released after WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of emails from the account of Democratic operative John Podesta, also listed the Clinton Foundation fundraising agreements between members of the donor class and their foundation.Some of the donors were tied to the Clinton family. The list goes onto include the family of Sen.

But I don't. I stay put in the airport, pick up my passport and get on with my journey. In Toronto, they just tell me when to pick up my passport. In their view I have been staying here legally without paying it, and if I pay, or even if I never show up, they'll say so. It seems to me all this talk of the ""unlawful presence visa"" or, more often, Canadian residency, is part of a cynical ploy to reduce the number of Canadians with green cards and reduce the opportunities for Canadians to work. The truth of the matter is: We have the greatest opportunity for growth in Canada any place in the world. In less than a decade, we are a world-class country, and we can do what we do best: take it easy. Canada in its history has been a rich and progressive society that has seen enormous benefits as a large and prosperous nation.

"It’s On: Between Duterte and America shorty BY PETER LEE I ’ve written a couple pieces of the smoking hot issue in Pivotland, Philippine president Duterte’s swerve toward a pro-PRC foreign policy, and what the U.S. and pro-American sector of the Manila elite are going to do about it. The first piece, Reports of death of  the Philippine Armed Forces (PABF)’first part‒, is based on a new investigation of government documents and interviews with witnesses, army and intelligence personnel, generals who were present at the scene, and several government witnesses. It shows that the first reported killing of a soldier to occur after the coup was the May 22-24, 1965, death of General Ponce ""Bongbong"" Marcos, who, in fact, was shot and killed by his own officers. At the time of his death, General Marcos, who had been in command of the army for more than four years, had become ""a public enemy of the United States, so much so that, unlike President Marcos, he was not permitted to leave the Philippines for years after the coup. He died at the behest of his superiors. Two sources who participated in the events say they were convinced Marcos would be dead. But that is exactly what happened. Although his head was cut off, two top generals were not even allowed to witness the killing.""‹ It would be helpful to review, here, the source-list provided by the Philippines National Police (PNP) in the article above, ""Duterte's Dirty Hands""‒which was published by the PNP, among other sources. Here, as in the other pieces of this issue, there is a consistent line of thought, among Philippine elites, and at least one in particular, between U.S. and Philippine interests. I have written several pieces, one focusing on the case of Richard Benen, and the two other pieces based on various intelligence reports, that I see in Pivotland as an indication of how the Philippines, not only a foreign policy objective, but a strategic target of the U.S. and their major partners, see themselves as a victim of their own hands after an illegal, and now, untenable, coup in 1966. If you follow me through the links, you will find that there has long been an understanding between the U.S. and its major allies, especially the Philippines and Japan, of what might happen after a U.S. occupation of an island in an undeveloped and disputed area. The notion is that such an occupation would destabilize the country, particularly the country in the Southeast Asia (including Malaysia) and South and Southeast Asia, where a similar situation exists between China and its Taiwan island, and the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia. While some commentators have taken these observations as evidence that the Philippines and Japan are in fact enemies of",1
"World's Oldest Person Had Smoked For 76 Years Report Copyright Violation World's Oldest Person Had Smoked For 76 Years actually, i think i remember a few of these people over the years who had hit significant milestones had had at least some 'bad' habits, such as smoking or drinking (but probably not to excess). Guess it depends on  your context with the context of smoking, if you smoked during or after a period of heavy, moderate or short duration (or if someone's 'smoke' includes smoking while in a bath or shower). Just my personal perspective on the topic, the guy who claims to be the oldest person in the US, according to Guinness records does NOT live as long as one might think with his smoking habits. And on the matter of physical ability, there is very much a difference between 1-5 years of smoking and 3-5 years as it were. In general in the United States people don't reach the age of age for smoking for at least 3 or 5 years, or even much longer. And the truth is that smoking only contributes to the growth of cancer rates, while smoking causes a great deal of disability and death due to obesity and other unhealthy diseases. If one wants to say smoking causes cancer, they are right, but they still should recognize that smoking is an evil thing; I've been told that ""smoking is cancer"". In the past many people have claimed their smoking was a disease problem, but I would like to point out that their smoking could only affect them in a certain specific way. It is impossible to describe smoking as a disease problem, because smoking can be used to increase your life expectancy considerably. And this is exactly why smoking causes the most illness for people who are already old. And remember; that is what makes the US one of the best countries in the world for aging of its citizens. So yes, smoking causes cancer; but smoking kills at least the 10th of the aging population each year. There are many factors that make each one of us sick, but the thing that makes life worth living is the health of those around us. The US suffers more from health problems than anywhere else in the world, but it is because of the laws of physics that our health is better than other countries. When you compare the American Health Care act to most other countries, your results will be even more interesting. They have some of the most stringent healthcare system in the world, and their health care workers all had to endure years of sickness on the job. But then again, that didn't stop us from improving the quality of us all living in this country.<|endoftext|>""I'm trying to work out the best way to be helpful,"" he explained, and made several attempts at telling me which parts of him still needed help.

" Ivanka Trump Tweets About Dead Syrian Children, And Twitter Has The PERFECT Response (TWEETS) Ivanka Trump s father, the man who calls himself President of the United States, obviously follows world events even if it seems like he follows them so he can exploit them. His children, Ivanka included, tend to either follow him or walk in lockstep with him on virtually everything. While  the president might look like he's in his element, that's usually where he ends up on the globe. Here are five times Ivanka Ivanka Trump used her power to help Donald Trump.

Donald Trump: Picking up and walking off a plane. A New York Times reporter asked Ivanka how Ivanka was involved with the travel of her father, Trump, when he canceled his flight from Paris to Brussels. Ivanka gave him a straight answer:

""My father is in France on business while I am in America working with local NGOs to improve the lives of women living with HIV/AIDS.""

Ivanka said that Donald Trump was ""bowing down"" at his hotel in the French capital.

Trump has always been a bit of a gentleman with women, so he'd be a fool to walk away from business trips like the one on Wednesday.

Ivanka, who was born Ivanka, made a big deal of how little it feels to not be able to pick her mom up that day: ""I don't know how that is possible. But I'm going to go over to the reception to try not to be upset.""

Ivanka, at a rally in Alabama on March 1, in support of incumbent Sen. Luther Strange. Getty

It sounds like Ivanka was trying for something to be excited about over having to pick up her mom. Then again, at least two of the last eight presidents (Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama) picked up their wives, daughters and mothers-in-law at home in the U.S. during their overseas travel events.

Ivanka Trump: Trump was at the helm of a massive conference called by the National Security Council. Donald Trump, who has nothing better to do but play golf, seemed to be the president at that one, holding a lengthy conversation with the staff of the National Security Council.

During the conversation, Trump told his staff that he was a big cheerleader for the Obama administration's foreign policy.

""I love his foreign policy,"" Trump told the people at the National Security Council. ""They say that it's the best in the world. I",1
"Kellyanne Conway SHUTS DOWN ABC News Hack George Stephanopoulos After He Tries To Convince Viewers Trump Isn’t Legitimate President [VIDEO] Talking to The Hollywood Reporter, Wentworth said that If Trump wins, we ll start looking at real estate in Sydney, Australia. No crime, no guns. The couple s plans pour further scorn over Stephanopoulos s supposed objectivity given his role as a prominent interviewer for ABC, having interviewed Donald Trump  for two years before his election victory.

On the way to Sydney they were both stopped in a shopping mall because he didn't have a ticket. ""It's my first foreign trip, I didn't know it would end so quick,"" said the man.

""The only reason I did that was I'm on a travel schedule,"" he continued. ""I'm going to take a little sabbatical. He came up and told me I looked nice at the airport.""

He was, to say the least. The Trump supporter said it was his first time abroad, and, like any first time traveller, he had no idea what to expect. ""I went back to London and I spent money,"" he said. And he said he was curious about this guy going on, saying he had spoken to ""a lot of tourists"".

To this, Stephanopoulos was not convinced. ""You know what? They get to London, get on the Tube, and they get picked up here, taken to one place and then picked up another place,"" she said. ""They're all on the same platform, so they could easily slip out, could easy pass through customs. I haven't spoken to the Brits about that. I don't understand why this is important.""

But this was not the first time he had been questioned about his sexuality. In 2013, a Muslim man, Rizwan Salaita, was attacked by Donald Trump supporters. And in one of the more notable moments of the GOP frontrunner's campaign, during one of his rallies, a protester attacked Trump's rival Hillary Clinton by repeatedly shouting ""Lock her up!"" and accusing her of being Hillary, but at times even asking her if she was being truthful.

Now that Trump is the frontrunner, the Republican frontrunner's campaign surrogates are doing everything they can to push back against the questions of Trump's sexuality. In fact, Trump's campaign chief, Paul Manafort, had to concede earlier this week to talk about ""inappropriate behavior"". He said that it was ""not cool"" for his campaign to be discussing it. ""I mean I don't even think it's a big deal,"" Manafort told Fox and Friends.

""When you're at Trump rallies talking about things that he's said that don't add up, things that are questionable to do with him, and people do it, you've got to be careful not to offend people, but he is not a politician,"" he continued.

New Zealand-based television show Space Adventures has a keen interest in helping people take journeys away from home, which are becoming increasingly popular for families looking to spend more time outside.

The program, in the northern hemisphere, aims to raise public awareness of and to benefit from the natural phenomenon, which has grown in popularity as satellite-based images of Earth have improved dramatically since the Second World War.

Now the pilot for the Australian show will take Australia to new heights, as the network will launch a series of satellite images that highlight unusual areas around our skies, such as Antarctic ice, Australia's coastlines and a vast expanse of Antarctica.

As well as the satellite imagery, Space Adventures will also broadcast the first episode of the documentary Space World: The Amazing World of Antarctica, which will show how the satellite images have changed over time, showing many of the regions the program explores in the new series, as well as how the natural world is changing.

The campaign comes at a time when space tourism is making big moves away from the traditional tourist attractions, where travelers spend their final days of their stay immersed in high-pressure spacesuits and flying rockets.

A new era is under way for this activity: in a recent survey, 62 per cent of Australian people said they wanted to see more space programs such as the show in their country.

Australian director Alex Renton is part of a team that has teamed up and funded the program with Australian media partners Sky, ABC, News Corp Australia and Space World, which will air in 20 Australian regions over nine episodes.<|endoftext|>By

"WHOA! EBT CARD DENIED So Woman Goes On A Rampage In Store [Video] This viral video shows a woman ransacking a store after her EBT card had been declined. We re all for help if you need it but food stamp cards are being given out like candy. The BIG question is why it took so long for the people in the store  to figure this out... Posted by: Mike C | January 6, 2015 11:28:00 PM

I was at a grocery store today in Kansas City, Kansas and there were some people shopping at the same time as me (my husband and I). The lady running the store refused to talk to us when we walked in and instead started following us. I was in shock and I started recording to see what was going on. Then after we ended up getting the food, she started backtracking when we weren't looking anymore and followed us and started trying to steal our EBT cards too. Our story sounds really dumb but people are not supposed to be stealing EBT cards. Is it illegal? I've never seen anyone steal EBT cards since I've been alive but I don't think it is. I think she just wanted to get her point across.

It was really frustrating to think that someone on a SNAP card is supposed to look around and give us food when we're literally on no food stamps all the time. Is it legal? Posted by: J.K. | January 6, 2015 11:56:00 PM

There were some in front but then started backtracking when we were not looking anymore and got to our cash register. I felt really bad for her as no one was helping her because that would cause too much tension in the relationship. But maybe I'm crazy for not caring or being in such a situation when I have no problem with it? The same with SNAP cards in general. Maybe what I've seen is ""someone just not paying attention and that's their fault if they are. I understand their frustration but it doesn't really mean much when you have someone like that in the store (that is my husband). People do steal all of our food and stuff like that but usually those don't need to hurt us or the community."" Is there any way to help people understand or stop people from stealing their cards? This kind of stuff would be so helpful. Posted by: B.M. | January 6, 2015 11:34:00 PM

So much for the champion of the factory worker or the champion of the poor In  addition to Hillary's obvious hypocrisy and obvious bias, Hillary Hillary has one more major issue. She has a strong opinion about the war on drugs Hillary Clinton has a very weak opinion about the war on drugs and she likes guns. So when she has a gun-grabbing, drug-stigmatizing anti-gun liberal who wants a war against the 2nd Amendment which is against the people's will, she is going to be a very easy sell to the American people.

Hillary Clinton Has Been in the Senate for a long time Hillary Clinton has been in the Senate for a long time and it doesn t mean the senate is the place to get your ideas into motion, so in 2012 she announced she would run for the senate seat that is next. The problem with these sorts of public announcements is that they have been known to generate a huge amount of media coverage which creates an unfair impression that they are something they are not. That is, she was declared and declared so strong that her ""outline"" was a long, detailed, complete, and detailed document of her plans to make law. Then she went right back to making public statements with some vague statements, which turned the public into the angry, anti-choice, anti-gun media on which her plans were presented, without really considering what her actual policies would be or have been. The media, especially talk radio, often run these kind of articles, because they know that the big-money funded, political machines will pay big bucks for the very biased opinions they provide. The same goes for anyone who runs for senate – especially when they have no real shot at the nomination, unless you are, you know, Ted Cruz . One day, you could easily make that argument, but Hillary Clinton is like a rock star. And once she gets there, you can't go back to anything and expect anything to stay the same because she is so obviously an ideologue. If you listen to all of her speeches, which every major candidate for president does, you can tell those speeches are all in total contradiction to the kind of person she is going to be as president. The reason that it is so hard to be a true pro-choice, gun-safety, gun-lose, gun-rights advocate when you own a billion dollar company is that we have the right to know how that business will actually move, if at all. Hillary will run from her own past, and then the media will cover those ads as being evidence that she is the anti-gun candidate when in fact",1
"Silent But Deadly - Russia Developing Devastating ‘Carrier Killer’ Torpedo - Alexander Vershinin Military Silent But Deadly - Russia Developing Devastating ‘Carrier Killer’ Torpedo While shrouded in secrecy, the ‘Khishchnik’ is thought to have characteristics that are an improvement on those of the well-known Shkval torpedo Originally appeared at RBTH In early October, Russian military analysts reported that a group of designers working  for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defense (MFA/DFA) of Russia (MMF) have been assigned to design an indigenously developed stealth technology for a new variant of its cruiser-class destroyers, the Khishchnik class. According to the sources, an unnamed group of designers working under the MFA/DFA program and led by Viktor Kondrak, the architect behind the Su-35K/MiG-29M ""Baroness"", has been contracted to develop, among others, a single-mode interceptor. The designers are expected to submit the design of the stealth technology for approval by the ministry of foreign affairs in late October, around which the MFA/DFA will prepare the final design for development. The project will be conducted inside Russia from the beginning and, as a result, it may take several extra months. This is not the first case of new technology being developed in cooperation with the MoF/DFA. In June of 2013, Russia signed a Memorandum of Understanding of a similar nature with the UK-based Royal United Services Institute for Defence Systems and Technology (RUIST). A similar process of design has already started with another shipyard in Russia, NAPRAZ. After the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, a government appointed commission headed by Naval Architecture of Russia (NAPRAZ), a subsidiary of MUAP, completed the design of several of its former heavy cruiser destroyers such as the Khrushchev class, which would become the flagship of the Soviet Navy. The commission also undertook the design and construction of a new naval cruiser in the name of the Krasnodon class. To prevent any confusion about which type of ship is currently under construction and what the process of making a new vessel was like, RUPOV and URSATU have been unable to provide a comprehensive list or the details of how both ships and their systems were designed, built, and operated. However, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the ships and ships' systems developed by NAPRAZ are a ""provisional model of the complete Krasnodon ship. They include all the relevant equipment. The Krasnodon ships have been prepared as part of [the] RUPOV Project."" However, this does no guarantee that any particular ship or variant will not go through its development through NAPRAZ and URIST, nor will it be included by the government when these bodies are merged. Indeed, in 2013, an MoD-",1
" Internet Destroys Imbecile Who Wants To Make Rape Legal, Get His Meet-Ups Cancelled (TWEETS/VIDEO) Misogynist blogger Daryush Valizadeh, better known as Roosh V., owner and operator of the He-Man Woman Haters site Return of Kings, is finally getting his comeuppance. Roosh had organized an International Tribal Meetup Day, for men like himself who believe that women are nothing more than property, and therefore rape  threats aren't really threats, and rape is worse than murder. Roosh had posted the invitation on the Return of Kings blog and then claimed he did not invite women on a private event, but a crowd assembled without a permit to his event. He also was called a rapist by fellow travelers who were there to harass women.

The event on International Tribal Meetup Day was called ""Women of the Occident: An International Tribal Gathering for the New Renaissance."" Roosh posted a note on his Facebook group, telling the crowd they were not welcome. (This would prove to be a very big mistake, since the people who had been invited all turned out to protest him. In the video at the top of this article, I watch them shout anti-rape slogans that ended the day.)

According to the organizer's Facebook messages in response to these protesters, it was an attempt to get Roosh out of town and to prevent other men attending, which in turn was just another attempt to silence those who oppose his ideas on abortion and same-sex marriage. The same crowd who turned out against Roosh was also supposed to be the group that came to help Roosh in his attempt to get his event cancelled. They weren't invited.

According to a letter sent out to the members of Return of Kings at 4 p.m., the Women of the Occident had been warned several times about being disruptive and that it was not a great idea to try to disrupt the meeting in their city. It also explained that members of Return of Kings feared they were going to be harassed and threatened with assault and other unwanted physical harm. There had been several such incidents at the conference itself.

Roosh, who describes himself on Return of Kings as an activist agitator on women's issues, tried to move onto the next question. He continued to argue that women are nothing more than property, and the notion that there are no rights to which women are subject. He also continued to argue that women are nothing more than property.

The members of Return of Kings then asked Roosh two points. The first was: ""If men can have a free right to an opinion on all sorts of topics, don't they have a right to the idea of a women being raped?"" The second was: ""Can we have separate meetings of our own on this subject to discuss women's rights?""

This was a fairly heated exchange, and at some point after Roosh took no time at all to answer his original question, his question",1
" The GOP Will Hate This Humiliating Fact Harry Reid Just Pointed Out About SCOTUS Nominations Politifact just humiliated Senate Republicans big time.During an appearance on Meet The Press on Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid pointed out that Democrats have never held up a Supreme Court nominee the way Republicans are doing now. You have to look at what has happened, Reid said. We have  always kept the court short, he said, and Democrats are the party that's holding up these nominees.""What Republicans are doing is they haven't just moved past [the Supreme Court's] Roberts.

""He's being so obnoxious that I think people need to listen. The majority leader can't possibly have time to listen to people, but we've seen this in this Congress before. They've been obstructionists, the minority, and we've been the ones holding them accountable.""And they haven't been doing that, Reid said.<|endoftext|>For many years, the United States has used a program known as the ""national intelligence emergency,"" which allows government agencies to hold on to critical foreign intelligence information for up to 10 years, as the administration sought to protect against foreign threats. But, in a ruling released a few weeks ago, a judge ruled that the law is so broad and expansive that a judge should instead consider when the executive branch should limit who can potentially gain access to foreign intelligence information.

At issue was whether, at a time when President-elect Donald Trump was being criticized for making unfounded allegations about former President Obama having wiretapped him in 2016, it is also appropriate for the president-elect, or any future president, to request a warrant from a federal judge to access foreign intelligence information within 10 years.

The judges' decision, which was filed a few months ago, ruled that it is. And in short order.

A recent Wall Street Journal review of the judge's ruling notes what it seems is a number of major cases involving national-security-related cases are moving from being decided by the US Supreme Court — which, unlike most US federal courts, is a branch of government — to the lower court system, which is what the Obama administration used before it left office. The ruling is similar to one by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer two years ago which found that the National Security Agency (NSA) was",1
" WATCH: Not A Single Woman Will Vote Trump After Seeing This Video A new ad from a conservative super PAC absolutely destroys Donald Trump, and it uses his own words to do the job. The commercial comes from Our Principles PAC, and it showcases ordinary everyday women reading a series of horribly sexist and misogynist quotes from current Republican presidential front-runner Donald  Trump.

In the clip below, YouTuber Tiffany Lutosha, who is a former Miss America contestant and former CEO of the organization America Votes, tells the women that she's a proud supporter of Trump because ""his message isn't just for working moms. A man with a vision is a man that I can get behind.""

But then she starts adding some real life and funny women quotes about a lot of things, like Trump's obsession with grabbing women by the genitals, and the ""women's body parts"" part of his message of ""make America great.""

And that's just the opening. At the end, Donald Trump is seen reaching out to some of the women, while wearing what appears to be a Donald Trump T-shirt and speaking with a white male voice. One woman can be heard saying: ""And yes, that will happen when he wants you to give his speech.""

The commercial ends with the first woman saying, ""So when he says, 'I am your president, and you are my vote,' he is just saying what he sees. It's not like Donald has made any overt reference to getting rid of women's reproductive rights.""

That part is the absolute most damning part of the ad, which has been shared over 7 million times on Facebook. Tiffany Lutosha, the super PAC behind the video, says in the video that she wanted to highlight ""the many instances"" where he makes sexist or racist remarks. It just doesn't sound like he uses the same language to mean what he says.

We have contacted Our Principles PAC for comment and will update.

This isn't the only pro-Trump campaign ad from an ad Super PACs are making in the Trump-Russia investigation. A former Republican candidate's ad released in late August featured women talking about what it's like to vote against Trump. And both campaigns, in fact, have paid millions of dollars to appear in TV spots with Democrats discussing Trump's scandals, including his 2005 groping of a woman and his now-infamous racist and Islamophobic comments.

But if the ads are the real problem, there are actually a lot of women out there who don't hate Trump, just because",1

STUDENTS BRAVE POURING RAIN To Take Down American Flag Patriotism is alive and well at this Florida school!COOPERGATE SCHOOL S FACEBOOK PAGE HAS A STATEMENT ON WHAT TWO YOUNG PATRIOTS DID: This is what RESPECT looks like at Coppergate. Two of our safety patrols, Nate and Isaac, quietly went to the courtyard and completed their flag duty in a  manner that left no doubt that they are American patriots.The incident occurred at 2:46 PM on December 3, 2015. The incident report states: ""Officers responded to a call of a disturbance on campus. After observing a man behaving aggressively toward another student, responding officers ordered a student into a car and pulled over. The second student refused to submit in front of the responding officers to identify himself. As both officers approached them, the second student pulled himself free from a rear wheel drive vehicle. The suspect grabbed the officer by both arms in a threatening manner. The suspect then dragged the officer into a nearby car. Officers arrived soon after and, using a Taser, dragged the suspect into the back of the truck. The suspect began beating on the suspect's chest and neck. The suspect resisted further assaults.""


The report goes on to describe what appears to be a physical assault where the victim ""has been kicked, punched, and kicked in the face repeatedly on his arm, neck, face, and head.""


According to the report, according to both victims, the suspect told them ""it was going to be OK (the story) if they don't submit. The police had asked them, 'Do you want to submit?' and he denied, saying no they couldn't have a police officer at this point, but they would still go to prison.""


In response, the injured victim ""said one of the officers was trying to slap him and one of the officers wanted to slap them and he denied. 'We know what you want to do, we do what's best for you,' one of the officers said. Later that night, the two officers asked why he was resisting. He said we never said that, the officer said. 'Yes, we did say you were going to submit, why didn't you tell us?'""


The incident report goes on to state that both officers are on medical leave from the department pending an investigation. (4:05 AM) Fox Tampa 4 News reporter Andrew Rafferty: ""I don't know what to think. They have two young men on medical leave so maybe something is wrong. I didn't think that this was going to go the way that it's been going. They told them there would be jail time...

That title is reserved for the ""villain,"" the one who's going to cause havoc to everyone — and possibly the universe.

With the upcoming season of ""Game of Thrones"" wrapping, there's been discussion and discussion that ""Game of Thrones"" star Kit Harington could be seen as being unfairly compared to the bad ladies in Westeros. He's playing Tyrion Lannister, the titular member of George R.R. Martin's novels. But what does ""the other bad lady,"" or the one whose storyline is being watched the most — or least? We decided to put our thoughts to the test — and found out here, in the comment section of our article:

You might be thinking that, in theory, Harington would win a Pulitzer for that one.

Wrong again.

It turns out that, for the past 30 years, it has been known that Kit Harington has a little bit more in common with Tyrion Lannister than the average character on ""Game of Thrones.""

Here's our list:

1. He's been referred to by his full name, William Brandon.

It's not as simple as that.

On ""Lost,"" he had an uncle who was named William Brandon. In an upcoming episode, we saw a flashback in which Brandon, like Robb Stark before him, is confronted by a woman named ""Maester Luwin.""

What would happen if you were to name someone else, with a different name, in the same situation? Well, there's another name you could use!

What started as a simple curiosity led me to create and curate articles on a wide array of subjects, usually relevant to my life and my interests. In November of 2013 I purchased my first computer. I've been writing blog articles since that time but am most often sitting down with a keyboard and copywriter to make these posts readable to readers around the world… all within the comfort of my living room.

I would say my dad started to put together weekly financial and personal articles around 1993-1994 for his online business. When I was born he had two computers available to him. One was a Dell computer and the other was a Dell monitor. My father was a pretty big geek but had no interest in investing, and he always got his information from the internet. When I was a kid, this didn‒t bother me much at first. I never went to school because I didn't want to be taught about it. I remember wondering if my parents‖s obsession over finance‖could‖t be traced back to my curiosity. I am a big fan of online financial sites.

"Hillary Clinton KNEW 5 years ago Anthony Weiner was a Pedophile - Wikileaks A WikiLeak’s email released on Monday reveals Clinton staffers knew as early as 2011 that Anthony Weiner had been messaging an underage girl but chose to take no action. In June of 2011, John Podesta, chair of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign – received news of an investigation into Weiner’s online  activities’

The emails were made public under new laws passed in 2015 aimed at fighting leaks. ""There had been a series of emails from the server that are highly relevant, in terms that pertain to Huma [Clinton] and were forwarded on to me in a meeting with Cheryl Mills,"" Podesta’s emails show. These emails are known as HRC2016-PS.

In a January 15 email to Cheryl Mills, former Clinton chief of staff John Podesta’s wife Jennifer noted a series of emails about Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. She wrote Clinton officials were looking into a ""recent development"" related to Weiner’s activities at the time ‪(sic’)."" I think this latest revelation may be more pertinent than any they have previously been aware of,"" she said.

But in a separate email sent to Huma Abedin, Clinton’s closest aide and longtime confidante, the Clinton camp and top leadership of Abedin’s and Podesta’s inner circle were not even aware that the story about Weiner’s emailing with an underage girl appeared in a New York Times’only to inform Hillary the next day of a new investigation.

Abedin responded to Abedin’s ""outrage"" email with the phrase’""Can you do we can find something like that?""’The conversation that followed was ‪""can you find it out if the news has even come out?""‪‪""No. It probably won't. I'm not aware of it and it doesn't seem to be part of anything in the news.""

Huma Abedin did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Breitbart on Thursday morning. An email sent to her about the emails about Weiner's emailing with a minor at the time of the story has yet not been returned.

The latest release of hacked emails comes as the State Department and Hillary Clinton’s team prepare to formally release the 33,000 pages of emails they say they released under an independent state department review, including more than 400 Clinton’s private, personal and work email accounts. The newly-released State Department email correspondence is expected to provide a new look at the political career of Secretary Clinton, as well as her interactions and decisions with the Obama administration.

"Study: Statin Cholesterol-lowering Drug Use Linked to Increase in Parkinson’s Disease Medscape Excerpts: BALTIMORE — New findings from a large national claims database show the use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to be associated with an increased risk for Parkinson’s disease (PD), contrary to previous research suggesting the drugs have a protective effect for PD. “We identified 20,000 Parkinson’s disease patients and  12,500 total subjects in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who did not respond to surveys on age, sex, race, education, marital status and cigarette consumption, suggesting that some of those who took statin-associated drugs also had Parkinson's disease‐ and that the drug may not reduce disease progression completely, but may do so by lowering risk of developing PD in PD patients. “The link between statin drug use and Parkinson's disease is well established,‬ “a finding supported by studies of participants in an American survey on statin use and Parkinson‘s disease’but also by the study of a national, population-based sample,‬‬ which also showed that the use of statin drugs to treat PD decreased with age despite a strong correlation with PD rates.‬ It is important to note that the participants in these studies were typically younger and were not representative of the population aged 40 through 80‬. We conclude that there are many additional reasons why statins may not be particularly good at treating PD while they may protect some patients from PD. “In addition to these important implications for the interpretation of existing studies, “we found that statin use is significantly associated with the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease‬. This is not surprising given the association‬of statin use‬with an increased risk for PD.‬ Our study found an increased risk for PD in people who took statin drugs for at least 5 years,‬even though there was no consistent and statistically significant association‬of statin drug use‬with a risk for PD. ‣While these results suggest that statins may protect against PD in persons who do not receive statins to control their disease,‬‬we conclude that statins may protect some PD patients from PD‬by reducing risk of developing Parkinson‡and by increasing the risk of PD in PD patients who do,‬‬with a potential adverse effect‬on the quality of their lives. The study also found an interaction between statin drug use and the underlying disorder‬and, again without a consistent and statistically significant association‬between statin drug use and PD.‬‫It is also important to emphasize that, while this study showed that statins are generally associated with increased risk of PD in persons who do not develop PD,‪the link between statin drug use and PD may be different in individuals with underlying conditions,‪so that",1
" WATCH: Bill Maher’s “Translation” of Hitler’s Speech Shows Where Trump Gets His Crazy Ideas Whether during the time of the ancient Greeks, the 1930s, or 2016, a demagogue is a demagogue. Bill Maher proved this last night on his show Real Time when he had a speech of Nazi dictator Adolph Hitler translated to English in order to contextualize Donald Trump s hate speeches. 

This is an important discussion to have and one of America's great cultural and political debates is still having its moment with our current political landscape. Trump does the most to divide us and the greatest damage is done when he attacks others with hateful and unfounded rhetoric. This has been a primary motivator for him to remain in politics as a full-blown fascist leader despite many of his own statements over the years. He is also the latest in a long line of white supremacists that I believe are dangerous and not who we should be electing to represent us.

The main thing to consider when debating this is if Trump is the only one who has a message that deserves our attention, or if there will always be someone who is willing to listen regardless of party. If Trump is an effective demagogue and if no one can stand him and no one can condemn him simply based on the way he addresses this issue, how do we choose someone to run alongside him as president to stop his vile actions?

The answer to this, I believe, is not everyone that would like to be president. I know this topic is controversial and very much divisive on a societal level, but the idea that I have some kind of innate capacity and ability to solve these issues in other ways makes me uncomfortable with the idea of electing someone like Trump to run as President of the United States.

In my opinion, it is not a stretch to say the Republican Party is far too divided when it comes to issues about race and immigration to the point where many members of it may not be comfortable with the idea of a President Trump taking the reins of the GOP and leading it forward.

On top of the Republican Party, we are also deeply split down the middle between those that think Trump is unfit for the position of President and those that think Bill Clinton should have won re-election regardless of the situation, a circumstance that Hillary Clinton has been proven to be far more successful in bringing about for the country if Clinton is in the White House when the Democrats are in a position similar to today.

If you vote for Bill Clinton, chances are you did so as your first choice due to his wife serving as Vice President only three years and with a lower profile than both her husband and Trump. I personally think that was a mistake and one I regret because I think the time has come for women and minorities to step out of the shadows and speak up. I also believe we should let Hillary Clinton have her own time to give us a better President Trump.

"Obama just cancelled oil and gas drilling on sacred Blackfeet land Tom Cahill | November 17, 2016 In a stunning move, President Obama has announced he won’t allow any oil and gas leases on land deemed sacred by the Blackfeet Tribe. After the announcement, Devon Energy, which was hoping to drill on 130,000 acres in Montana — some of which housed  sacred archaeological sites — pulled out of the proposal. Meanwhile, Native American groups were quick to take advantage. ""Our Tribe was told they could no longer drill on Blackfeet lands. They can't drill unless we withdraw,"" says the Blackfeet Tribal Chairman. Now an Obama Environmental Protection Agency program manager has resigned over the president's decision. The decision, however, has been slammed by the Blackfeet Tribe President, who says it would take ""more than one oil company to cancel or pull out of land that's already been reserved for them.""

"CLOAKED ORDER: Who’s Really Behind ‘New Authority’ for CIA Drone Strikes? 21st Century Wire says Earlier this week, the mainstream media reported that the Trump administration granted the CIA a new secret authority broadening their ability to conduct drone strike operations against suspected terrorists. The new drone provision said to be without oversight from the Pentagon, was brought to our attention  by journalist Adam Entous of Consortium News. Under the provision of the NDAA, ""The Central Intelligence Agency may conduct military airstrikes against al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces through unmanned aerial vehicles unless the CIA determines that using such strikes would be in the national interests ..."" Entous notes that the government's use of drone strikes with secret and unapproved authorization is a practice so long that it was never officially approved by Congress. The President signed the NDAA into law on March 21st, 2009, after months of lobbying by the Obama administration, which wanted to end the war in Afghanistan with the war. It provided a sweeping authority to extend the CIA's drones operation. A declassified report from 2009 showed that the CIA targeted Al Qaeda figures in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Syria. The report also showed that the CIA's drone operations had killed hundreds of civilians in the ""war on terrorism"" as well. The report concluded that ""the American people do not support the use of our armed forces in this way."" As the Wall Street Journal reported back when this secret drone authorization was passed, there were already rumors of its use in Syria.

In July 2008, Obama said that he would give a written statement to Congress, saying that drones had been responsible for several innocent deaths, including ""in several strikes in Benghazi."" In July 2009, the National Journal reported that it had gathered evidence that the CIA had been responsible for the deaths of five American citizens, including Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, a school teacher and teacher of Islamic studies. The New York Times reported on August 5, 2009 that a CIA memo was found in a safe inside a house in Abbottabad with other classified documents concerning al-Awlaki and Osama bin Laden's whereabouts. It revealed that al-Awlaki had attended the al-Qaeda training center in Afghanistan prior to his death in 2011. The Washington Post reported (July 27, 2009) how another CIA contractor said a covert drone strike killed Awlaki, along with another American, Samir Khan.

The report says ""Obama's drone war has killed some 400 people, with around 200 civilians. Some of these attacks were in and around countries that Obama has declared safe zones."" It adds that the strikes have killed American, British, Palestinian, Egyptian, and even Iraqi civilians. In July 2009, the Associated Press reported that more than 20 of America's largest defense contractors ""have privately confirmed to The Guardian that they are paying up to $8bn to a Pentagon firm",1
" Trump Supporter Disgustingly Tells Black People To ‘Go Back To Africa’ (VIDEO) Donald Trump has brought every racist out of the closet and given them a megaphone as well as the courage to openly be as awful as humanly possible. His campaign events might as well be called white pride rallies. They are disgusting, deplorable, and outright un-American.In yet another example of  the Trump campaign's lack of diversity, a white American woman named Amanda Todd was caught on video wearing a Trump bumper sticker. On Tuesday, he went after her for being black, making fun of her hair and using white supremacist rhetoric – a few minutes after her supporters chanted ""build that wall."" That led to Todd's retweet, which immediately went viral with more than 1 million upvotes before she was blacklisted.It was one of several cases of Trump targeting black Americans as racists and white supremacists. But what is worse is that his opponents will say nothing; they are just as guilty of not doing their own due diligence before they attack their opponent. Trump's words have been proven to be a textbook example of racist rhetoric used as political propaganda. When he does talk about the Holocaust, Trump has said things like ""the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust,"" while repeatedly calling for the mass extermination of the Jews, saying his views are ""very, very unpopular"" among Jews. Trump has been quoted saying ""the Jews are a very, very dangerous people, not only in this country, but throughout the entire world."" He has even once stated that his campaign chairman would have his head ""beheaded"" (of course he didn't). The reality is, as President, he has plenty of room to be racist, xenophobic and racist. His hateful rhetoric has given far too many blacks, Latinos, Muslims and LGBTQ Americans a false sense of pride. His entire campaign would be a total shame if its supporters acted in accordance with these vile words.<|endoftext|>Cars, trucks and helicopters have hit the streets of Chicago's Loop neighborhood, leaving hundreds across the city stranded in cars.

"ROLLING STONES DEMAND TRUMP Stop Using Their Music: “Can you imagine a President Trump?…The worst nightmare” As a side note, the last major appearance by the geriatric Rolling Stones band, was a free concert in Havana, Cuba.

The Rolling Stones are known to play concerts in a number of places (including Europe and North America), but Cuba and the Soviet Union are perhaps their most familiar. There's something pretty cool about seeing an African American singer perform on land that once sat empty, under communist rule.

DETROIT -- In the wake of the Canadian Air Forces' recent deployment to Kandahar in Afghanistan, the prime minister called for Canada's Armed Forces to maintain a presence in Afghanistan and ""stay.""

The Prime Minister had announced a plan to build up about 600 troops for an additional year to counter a resurgence of Islamic State fighters and continue to counter Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also expected to announce further support for U.S.-led efforts against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), as well as its ""moderates"" who are fighting the group.

He also suggested that he's ready to consider additional funding for training local security forces if the request is made to the parliament.

""A military force in Kandahar might provide the forces the military services we need,"" Trudeau said before heading off a news conference.

""They will be able to assist our troops in Kandahar in terms of logistics - in terms of the support that is necessary, which is actually necessary in order to maintain security in Kandahar -- but they will also be helping to maintain our relationships with our allies at home in Canada. We can't just depend on the United States. We need the United States to play an active role in protecting Afghanistan.""

Canada is in Kandahar to spend about $15-million on its first military campaign, one that comes on top of the $3.9-billion already spent on the war. It's part of a larger strategy by Trudeau intended to build the force so it can help the forces battling the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM, which now also includes former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden).

Canada's new plan could affect the military's combat readiness.

President Trump Gives Fatherly Advice About ‘The Road of Life’ to UCLA Basketball Players You ve gotta love this president and his ability to send personal messages via twitter He just gave some fatherly advice to the three UCLA basketball players in deep trouble for shoplifting while in China President Donald Trump on Thursday encouraged the three UCLA basketball freshmen who he helped get  into college and got suspended last year to help solve the national debate over black student athletes.

The president has taken a liking to one particular young man in particular. The president has taken a liking to one particular young man in particular.

""Be careful,"" Trump tweeted last Thursday, in which he called the students ""potential political prisoners."" The president had followed up later with an interview with the University of California Chancellor, Janet Napolitano. ""They shouldn't. They're going to be great players for China,"" he said. ""You're going to be great.""

Trump and Napolitano, who Trump has praised often as the best in her profession, appear to share the same sentiment about the situation. ""The three players were detained for four hours last night,"" Napolitano said, but the students did not know the name of Trump's friend. ""I think people may have realized some of the tweets from the president, because he tweeted about them and talked about them,"" said Napolitano during an interview last week.

Trump was also quick to tweet out about Napolitano's speech to the University of California and her handling of the situation. Napolitano, the former general counsel for the American consulate in Beijing, said she didn't think much of what Trump had to say during that interview, but she did think how it was received, telling the Washington Post that Trump's words were not reflective of her work there. ""But he certainly had more to say than I wanted to hear,"" she said.

According to the White House, Trump didn't realize what the three teenagers and the Chinese consul wanted to tell the president. Trump has been outspoken in his criticism of China but has been silent on their case.

The president tweeted on Thursday: ""A very bad and dangerous regime, executed by one of the most evil and demented people ever to serve in the United States of America, is taking place in North Korea,"" which led to a backlash from some.

The president's message, which included a promise to help, has been a major sticking point in recent weeks between the US and North Korea. Trump responded to the crisis by suggesting that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was not just a madman, but a ""mentally deranged dotard.""

The president has, at times, taken a more diplomatic approach with North Korea. In July he sent four South Korean diplomats home in response to Pyongyang's sixth and more powerful nuclear test.

"Trump in the White House    : Information Trump in the White House By Noam Chomsky November 14, CJ Polychroniou : Noam, the unthinkable has happened: in contrast to all forecasts, Donald Trump scored a decisive victory over Hillary Clinton and the man that Michael Moore described as wretched, ignorant, dangerous part-time clown and full-time sociopath is the  President of the United States, not me. What a miracle! If not one of the biggest upsets of the century. You might think I'm making a joke with that, but what exactly is happening, what is happening? Let me explain. I have to admit, to my surprise, that the polls were actually quite accurate. They were predicting that, in the election, Trump would get about four seats from the Republican Party but he won over all these traditional Republican supporters of President Obama. Trump defeated them, because he won in the white working class, those from working class families. And I am pleased to say that this has been completely confirmed by the polls, which have made very clear that many whites in America are now deeply disillusioned with the Democrats. That's the real surprise to me, that this happens to be Donald Trump, not me. I know exactly how people respond. We speak French and English, we eat French, we wear French clothes, we live in French cities and our homes are in French suburbs. So, as we listen to what is happening to our children and our grandchildren, I have no hope, no hope that the next President in Washington will be a president for everyone; there is a kind of intolerance and hatred towards whites and towards European things, so it's not a surprise that so many people voted for him, especially in the rustbelt areas where most immigrants live. It's not as if they have forgotten the racism and the discrimination and discrimination the whites have suffered on their doorstep for over fifty years in this country, with their own descendants among us. In our suburbs and in the countryside everywhere I went, there were racist signs, slogans, and even in the newspapers that were published in the 1930s, there's the phrase «Racism in the USA», which has the force of law. But it's not just white people who are feeling a lot of anger, it's also with the young people who voted for Trump and with the minorities: young and old, the women, the old and the young, especially of Hispanic ancestry who are now feeling very isolated, very disempowered. The last couple of weeks I've seen demonstrations across the country and demonstrations of women, mostly young women, marching and shouting, and it made me think. When I heard Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in the last debates, I said that Trump was not a nice candidate, the way he described Mexicans. But when, in fact, Trump said things that the way Mexicans were treated by the Clinton Administration",1
"Trump Catches What Sick Reporter Snuck In Interview, Has Priceless Response Trump Catches What Sick Reporter Snuck In Interview, Has Priceless Response Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This CNN’s Dana Bash (left), Bash Interviewing Donald Trump (right) Donald Trump stopped campaigning for just an hour-and-half to work in a brief appearance at the opening of  Trump Tower in Manhattan's Manhattan borough, after a reporter slipped in an interview question without telling him what to say. A New York real estate developer and reality TV star who's long been a lightning rod for controversy, Donald is expected to be the Republican nominee for the presidency. In a joint interview with The New York Times' Gabriel Sherman and Bloomberg Politics' Andrew Ross Sorkin, he responded to the reporter -- with no warning and without knowing the reporter's question was about him. From The NYT: ""Mr. Trump's advisers say they did not know at the time that the reporter had been talking to his opponent, Hillary Clinton — whom Mr. Trump accused in the run-up to the presidential debate last September of deliberately hiding a classified email server on her private email server. So the question may have been a bit of a surprise to him. ""We are not allowed to put a reporter into conversations,"" said Mr. Trump's press secretary, Jason Miller. ""He just stepped up to ask a really good question."" He added that he was ""not surprised"" to learn of the slip-up because ""you don't know what's going to go into your mouth."" Mr. Trump is expected to receive an award on Oct. 30 from the Trumps for his effort to build a border wall. On Friday afternoon, he responded to the leak of an email from the private email account of Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri. Palmieri suggested that private messages exchanged with President Barack Obama had been sent by a former State Department official, John Bentel, who now runs Clinton's campaign. Mr. Trump said, ""I wouldn't be surprised if those private messages were also hacked."" According to Mr. Shapiro in his piece, he said ""it also remains to be seen whether the timing and content of the conversation ... with the reporter suggest that was the intent -- or even an attempt to cover it up in any way."" He also noted that Mr. Trump, who's won 11 consecutive primaries, is widely credited with his support among the general electorate, many of whom can relate to the frustrations many Americans feel about politics, but have had trouble affording cable, and radio programming available to them, on cable. The New York Daily News reported on his appearance: ""The former reality TV star has said he wants to attract an army of 'New Yorkers' to 'defy' Democrats and Republicans in order to win. 'I want our people to be the ones that have fun on the Trump Train' he declared in an interview with Bloomberg Politics",1
"Trump: Don't Follow the Bush-Obama Foreign Policy Legacy Written by Jacob G. Hornberger Eight years ago, President Obama had a chance to change the warmongering direction that outgoing President Bush and the U.S. national-security establishment had led America for the previous eight years. Obama could have said, “Enough is enough. America has done enough killing and dying. I’m  tired of this. I’ll end this war.‐‬ It was too little, too late. Obama had lost. The world had fallen into a deep hole. The United States, once the best hope of world peace and peace-loving, was now a military aggressor with no hope of changing the world into an independent world leader. Today, Iraq is destabilizing Syria. Iran has nuclear weapons. A nuclear North Korea could deliver nuclear weapons to the United States. The U.S. and China are building and strengthening their military and economic might. The only question will be if these threats are kept in check. The American people will not be able to accept the Obama regime�s aggressive unilateralism. But even if they were to accept Obama into the White House, it is unlikely that Obama will be able to fulfill his commitment to his predecessor�s legacy, which was to withdraw American forces from Iraq. Rather than returning to that war, President Obama might be looking to pursue a diplomatic agreement that offers Iraq a peaceful, permanent place to rebuild, rebuild, rebuild. President Obama would then be likely to use his political power in the United States to keep his promise of a U.S. troop exit from Iraq. But as we will see, not every U.S. president can achieve such goals. This article by Jacob G. Hornberger may be read at www.soros.org/watch.php.

*** *** ***

The Bush war in Iraq was one of the greatest and bloodiest international wars of the twentieth century. It brought with it some of the most serious consequences to the world, to American interests and the American people. As the U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003, the U.S. president had promised the world in 2001 that there would be a ""nation�s coalition of states that will bring an end to the carnage of war."" At the same time, however, there was an unmistakable effort to make war with Iraq impossible and for the United States to be seen as morally responsible for its intervention.

The first part of the campaign to destabilize Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein was conducted by U.S. special operations forces, which began with an attempt to recruit Iraqi civilians to fight alongside the enemy. There was an elaborate operation to deceive local people into accepting the operation, which they did with considerable cynicism in the hopes that the Iraqi people would accept it with great ease without being informed about the operation�s details. At the end of the day,",1
"Major Russian Geopolitical Moves Going Unnoticed in Wake of US Election | The Vineyard of the Saker 424 Views November 17, 2016 No Comments Guest Posts The Saker by Oleg Maslov It’s official, Russia has decided to grab the bull by the horns. Just one week after the shocking vote in the US presidential election resulted in a Trump victory, Russia has decided to pull all the  stops in an ""aggressive"" war against America‒from all sides. Russia announced yesterday that it is sending four cruise missile-launched cruise missiles toward the US Pacific territory of Guam, and plans to deliver the missiles in early next week. This action is part of an ""aggressive"" campaign by Moscow against U.S. military assets in the Pacific, according to Defense News reporter Alexei Yarosh‖, who writes with the Russian-language New Civilizations‖. The move is part of efforts that are part of Russia's efforts to deter Washington from using its military might to respond to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. ""The message from Russia is clear: it knows that Washington is no longer able to keep its promises and accept NATO's military modernization and expansion to its borders if it has become a reliable partner for Russia. As a major Western defense supplier, Moscow feels its strategic interests are at stake and sees the need to send an increasingly aggressive message to the U.S.,"" read a Defense News interview, published earlier this month‖. ""If Washington does not respond to the threat that Russia poses, Russia will act to take its place as the sole guarantor of Europe,"" reads the statement. The new attack came after the missile strikes in the Baltic states were seen as a signal that the Kremlin is planning a counterstrike. However, Russia's intervention has largely been seen by many commentators as a show of force, as it was seen as a way for Trump to try and show that Russia's influence is rising while he is president. The military operation could also be intended to reassure NATO members that they would not be attacked if they choose to defend their territory against Russian aggression. Since the Kremlin already had a stockpile of ballistic missiles in readiness to use if needed, it wasn't necessarily a surprise that Moscow decided to strike first. The first missile was launched at around 2:44pm EST on November 17, with the missiles apparently not landing in the territory of Guam. The official Russian military newspaper Izvestia‖ announced that the U.S. missile strike was meant to protect Russian airspace near Palau, as seen on radar. If that was a message to Washington that it would take action, the attack would make it harder for the United States to persuade other countries to join the military alliance. Although the United States has already agreed to join international military operations, including strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria, in order for Russia to send missile defenses to the western Pacific, it also must show that its military forces can operate more effectively",1
" Trump’s Brexit Response Is A DISASTER, And Hillary Just Nailed Him For It (VIDEO) Donald Trump had a prime opportunity to take advantage of Britain s decision to leave the European Union in the so-called Brexit. Appearing at his golf course in Scotland, Trump held a press conference a few hours after the outcome of the British referendum was clear.Instead, the presumptive Republican nominee  decided to hold one of the same events in London last week and then hold back a bit more because, according to The Telegraph:It's likely he plans to return to the area where he spent all day just a few months ago before appearing on a major broadcast television and newspapers network that is heavily owned by the Trump Organization.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=f1-Wv-lhU8Q

While on top of all of this, it is possible that Trump may need a private helicopter ride from his golf resort in Scotland. For many, this is just another opportunity Trump has without the public attention the candidate usually receives after a big win. In fact, Trump is often described as simply the most successful businessman in history who has yet to win the White House by some but will certainly have more chance now that Brexit is over.

In addition to having the best business experience of any presidential candidate thus far, Trump is an accomplished philanthropist with $100 million to his name, and even in the wake of the collapse of the banking industry, the billionaire has been a vocal supporter of charity and clean energy. One of Mr. Trump s philanthropy goals is the construction of a nuclear waste repository at the Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Last week, Trump announced that construction on the site was almost set for completion but could be delayed for several more months by a federal lawsuit and environmental opposition.

If the Trump campaign is planning on returning to Scotland, it will likely do so with an eye on the local referendum by which he won the last one. If Trump is hoping to win that referendum in November, it is unlikely that he would be able to stay on until the end of the campaign. At some point, he will likely have to start acting like it too.<|endoftext|>How do you fix a problem with one thing while allowing your other two, a couple of dozen things to take on a completely different perspective?

"DEAD BROKE HILLARY Buys Million Dollar “Mother/Daughter” Home For Chelsea…After Busted Giving Only 5.7% Of Clinton Foundation Money to Charity The 2014 IRS filings for the Clinton Foundation were recently released and the numbers were absolutely sickening. Out of $91.3 million spent in 2014, the organization s IRS filings show that only $5.2 million of that went to actual charity. That s because the candidate who says she represents the  ""best interests of women"" is actually the opposite. That's right. Hillary Clinton's wife is trying to keep a foundation that provides no women's healthcare and no basic food and children s aid.

This report by the New York Times is just the latest example of how this system works. In 2015 and 2016, the Obama administration, acting on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, took $1.1 million from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation. Clinton was also given the blessing of President Obama because it gave her influence at the highest levels which allowed her to influence policy with a foreign donor in just about every foreign policy area.

Hillary Clinton was so powerful because of Obama and Barack Obama's foreign policy and foreign policy ties. President Obama gave her the blessing to be president.

That s absolutely sickening.<|endoftext|>Sophie Deville was born in 1794 in Antwerp, in the north-western part of Belgium. At the age of nine, she was sent to Paris by the Queen of Prussia to serve as the wife of the Prince of Orange, King Charles VI. In 1797, Charles died and Sophie was taken as his own; only the young prince later became his personal mistress.

She was married twice, to Charles De Guenet and Jean Philippe de Guenet in 1796 and to the young Baron Albert of Poitiers in 1798.

De Guenet's first wife, Marie de Courcy, the daughter of King Louis XIV and Margrave of Antwerp-le-France, died in July 1793 and Sophie returned to Belgium where the two married soon afterwards when they went to live in Saint-Louis where she had been at school at the local convent school. It is not entirely clear why they chose to marry during a time of King Charles IV s administration which took over in 1796, as a change of regime might allow more time for the succession to be carried out: for it can be assumed that Charles IV wanted Sophie to take advantage of her royal education and her royal skills in order to ensure that he would remain head of the state for many years to come.

She went on to study under the famous French social theologian, St. Jacques of Caen, and later to become close friends with John Stuart Mill, whose famous book Liberalism and Democracy was first published under her parents' influence.

"(VIDEO) OBAMA THROWS AMERICA UNDER THE BUS…AGAIN I am a student of history so I tend to actually be familiar with many of these episodes that have been mentioned. I am the first one to acknowledge that America s application to concern around human rights has not always been consistent. And, I m certainly mindful that there  are those who believe that the Declaration of Independence was just a way to get out of slavery. So this is an attempt to highlight the contradictions in how the United States has applied human rights and how it continues to apply them. It is also my hope that the show provides the audience with some knowledge as to what Americans believe about how well they have been able to pursue global justice.

How did the idea for SCTV come about? How did you guys know the show would eventually end up on the air?

What we were really looking to do back in the summer of '97 was to make a comedy show. I think the only comedy we did back then was a bit of the old school, the old school ""What do you think about this?"" thing and, yes, it will have a joke about the world's largest democracy. And we thought, well, we would definitely have a satirical take on it but this is a comedic show. So we would sort of try to do in this show different ways to challenge that philosophy to see how would the show go off. It was kind of an experiment.

Well, it worked. It really worked. There were some really funny moments in there and, of course, it still has some bad stuff! So it is not all bad. But, yeah, the idea started back in early July right before the first episode went on air, we had all a couple times before the first episode.

And in terms of the writers, I remember them asking me, ""How can you possibly write something that this would be the first one?"" So it is always a good idea to know that you are, in fact, going somewhere you didn't plan on. You didn't even plan this out so this is the best way to write. In fact, I always tell the writers, if something I do, or this comes along, that, in its very nature, it will be a bad idea or it will be a good idea but because I am telling the story, it has a sort of weird quality to it. And then, if it turns out to be so great that I didn't even know that, I have to admit that this isn't so much just being the most honest thing I'm capable of telling you because it goes well beyond that. It just feels right to it on a higher level. I think a great writer will often turn out to be the most honest person you know.

" Monica Lewinsky Wrote An Obituary For Roger Ailes And It Was BRUTAL Last week, disgraced former Fox News chief, Roger Ailes, died. I know you re supposed to speak reverentially about the dead, but Ailes was toxic. He was a misogynist, a racist and he turned low information voters into a key demographic. Without Roger Ailes, we would likely not have had  Donald Trump. This wasn't about politics or politics. He was a toxic figure for sure. But more importantly, he created the political atmosphere that allowed his sexual harassment accuser to speak out on tape. Roger Ailes helped fuel every scandal in recent memory. He made sure that women were afraid to enter or remain at his events, or that it was illegal to be at his events at all. He made sure they had to wait outside by himself and watched the other people arrive. This atmosphere has never existed on this planet or in any country. Now his death brings this toxic atmosphere to an end. This is an amazing loss for his daughter, who will live happily ever after. But this is also a wake-up call for every sexual predator out there. We want to fight sexual assault and rape in the workplace. But we also want women to speak up and ask for help instead, which we can do if these predators are caught. Women will help us to win, yes, but ultimately, men and women will win the struggle. Men must fight sexism, and not just against women, but against all of society.

But we will continue to fight for women's rights and justice. This is a story that has to be told. And hopefully, we are one step closer to the truth.

We have to face the real issues behind these events. A lot of these women lied and denied and talked about their rape fantasies for years. A lot of them were very drunk, which is why it's so difficult and upsetting. One more thing: I want you to remember that women have to be responsible to our children and children's children.

Derek Jeter could get ready for camp today with a new name.

According to The New York Times today, the Los Angeles Angels first baseman and his management team are discussing a name change for Jeter that could give the Angels a more dynamic name for the 2014 season.

Sources tell The Times there was some conversation about names in Jeter's past but, after Jeter returned from a lengthy stint on paternity leave with baseball, team officials decided to move on, according to sources.

One of the reasons, according to that source, was that the players and Jeter's management were convinced he would soon turn 34 and wanted him to be able to play out the remaining years of his deal.

The Angels also did not want Jeter to play his final year of the contract that he signed after being selected in the third round (No. 9 overall) of the 2008 draft out of South Carolina and had the rest of his contract through 2017.


Jeter's status as a free agent makes him one of the rarest players in baseball. He signed for $75 million in 2007 and is now in the last season of a seven-year, $200-million deal he signed a year ago that includes a player option for 2017 and a club option for 2018.

Despite missing most of camp with a fractured right ankle, Jeter is expected to make his first start for the Angels Sunday night against the Rangers, whose team logo features a ""X for baseball"" in a star.

While he will wear No. 12 for now, Angels coach Mike Scioscia said Saturday that he might change it.

Jeter, 29, has two years remaining on his $110 million contract, and if he does go out with the ""X"" logo on his new uniform,",1

The newly released Snowden documents confirm that American intelligence agencies have for many years exploited NSA software that has had its source code stolen by a Chinese company, according to the Associated Press.

Documents dated 2013 from the NSA's Office of Information Assurance (OIA) reveal that American intelligence workers ""were used to manipulate digital information using NSA's collection and analysis programs"", AP reported Tuesday.

The NSA and US intelligence agencies rely on the Chinese to help them monitor and analyze the internet. But the theft of Snowden's cache has led to a public outcry over Washington's relationship with the global technology industry.


The leaked documents reveal that analysts at the FBI, CIA and CIA Headquarters used software from a Chinese company called Quanta Group, which had taken over US intelligence services' intellectual property from its German parent.

Quanta Group was bought by Oracle Corp and then taken over by Oracle Corp-backed company Acxiom to create what is claimed to be one of the largest private cloud companies in the world, according to The Times .

Quanta Group said it ""refused to comment further on its ownership of Oracle"", according to the Associated Press.

""We would like to strongly deny any suggestion that we hold any responsibility for the theft or illegal act or conduct,"" Quanta Group said in a statement Wednesday.

This loss occurred around 5 a.m. Wednesday morning while another plane was heading between two different airports, Atlanta police said. One of the planes was a USA Airlines 727 that was heading into Atlanta. The plane lost power at 6 a.m., after another plane was en route and at the same time a third flight was en route. A total of two jets were grounded with power restored after about two hours. The first one to come back to the terminal was an American Airlines A320 which was headed into Atlanta. It lost power at 6 a.m. Tuesday morning. Then there was another American Airlines A350 that was also en route, going from Atlanta to Newark, New Jersey. It also had power, but due to a power blackout was not able to resume its trip as scheduled. Another American Airlines A320, which was en route, had a power problem but the aircraft was returning to its terminal. The third airline also en route had power out for one hour Tuesday morning. At 6:16 a.m. the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was experiencing a power outage due to a sudden power loss. Atlanta police spokesperson said the Hartsfield-Jackson is the second-busiest airport in Georgia. It was not surprising as the Atlanta airport is only about five miles north of Savannah and one mile west of downtown.

It was an unusual event though to see the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta. According to the airport official all of the buildings around it have a total of only around 25,000 square feet of space. The flight deck of that plane is just 1.85 thousand square feet. This can only mean that at least 10 people were killed and countless others are in a serious state of shock.

The other news source that has reported on the strange event is the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper quoted one of the people who was on duty on the plane, as saying it was flying low over New York when the plane suddenly exploded and then took off. The news service quoted a Georgia Power spokesman saying that the incident is under investigation and he did not have some details yet. It will be interesting to see what exactly happened with that power failure at the airport.

On Thursday, the Trump administration announced that it will soon roll back a regulation that was part of Obama's 2014 executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, citing a desire to ""restore national security.""

The order was announced Friday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which had also stopped enforcement of a directive that said anyone over the age of 18 could not ""visit lands or waters"" of those countries.

ICE's move to repeal the ""Travel Ban"" on immigration from seven Muslim countries was the last thing anyone expected from the Trump administration. What everyone was expecting was that the Trump administration would finally remove President George W. Bush's 2014 executive order, but that wasn't the case. This was far from the first executive order the administration has attempted to repeal, as President Donald Trump has threatened to do the same.

During his election campaign, Trump promised that he would rescind Obama's executive orders banning people from seven countries as well as one for guns from ""people coming into this country illegally."" He called the executive orders ""a lot worse than I said I would do.""

Trump's new executive order could also benefit the president in the short-term",1

"SpaceX: Explosion Rocks Launchpad at Firm’s Cape Canaveral Facility in Florida 21st Century Wire says The privatization of space, and what were formally state-run NASA space agency projects in the United States, has had its share of high profile controversy in recent years. Today s incident will only punctuate some of those concerns.Early this morning, we re told that an explosion  in a Russian cargo ship killed 30 people and was reported to have happened off the coast of North Korea. The ship and the container were carrying Chinese goods and cargo, and the crew had been aboard for approximately three weeks, according to North Korea's State news agency. The cargo ship is believed to have been carrying food at the time of the explosion.""This is very concerning, in terms of an accident resulting in multiple deaths,"" said John Hyten, assistant director at the Arms Control Association.The death toll was immediately raised to thirty, which is about four the number of Americans who lost their lives on Sept. 11. Russia has said the explosion was caused by explosions and an electrical discharge in the ship, which authorities believe involved chemical munitions in the cargo ship.North Korea's state-approved newspaper, Rodong Sinmun , has denied the allegations, but other western outlets have cited satellite and radar images as part of their story.It's unclear on exactly how many people were aboard the space ship but it is safe to speculate. There's been little in the way of credible information about the extent of it on the ground. The vessel was carrying cargo including food for a factory in the impoverished eastern port city of Chosun.According to the North Korean news agency KCNA , the blast caused by the explosion was believed to be electrical and chemical, so the blast would not have been unexpected.However, the site could not be reached by our team until this morning. According to Hyten, this could also be part of an effort by local authorities not to allow anyone to access the cargo ship.Hyten believes a series of previous space accidents in Russia have had a lot of the blame placed on the actions of the government. In July of 2012, a small Russian supply ship carrying about 500 metric tons of grain was lost in bad weather off of the coast of North Africa. It was a result of a faulty propulsion system in the ship, and the blame for it spread, leading to the arrest, imprisonment and eventually the removal of the vessel's captain.Hyten says the recent incident could have been avoided by having the cargo ship move and ship out of the area.""If that was happening more frequently it'd have to be much, much more closely monitored by North Korea than it was. We know that they would have taken steps in December 2016 to prevent this,"" he said.Hyten believes that the government and the Russians did not allow the vessel to move, and that the company handling the cargo ship's operation was also responsible.Hyten believes that",1
" WATCH: Conservative Group BRAINLESSLY Ran These Ads Cheering Trumpcare AFTER It Died Trump and the House GOP suffered a stunning defeat on legislation they promised would deliver better healthcare to millions, despite that promise being a lie. They pulled the Trumpcare bill from the floor early Friday afternoon, before getting a vote, because they knew it wouldn t pass. And that was  why Trump's White House is still being sued by the US District Court who sued last week claiming that Trump's executive order that suspended immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries violated federal immigration policy.


On this day, May 8th, 2016, at approximately 6:40 a.m., President Obama made a historic speech announcing President Trump's transition of power. Obama went into details, citing the history of his administration being under attack. The last time such a dramatic speech was ever held in the Oval Office was during Richard Nixon's last weeks in office. Now President Trump is coming into office, Obama is being threatened in his office for his executive actions that are destroying our economy and destroying our country.

During the speech, Obama gave his thoughts on our economy. To begin with, it is clear that the president's goal is to keep his legacy of a more prosperous America from dying with his signature executive actions on immigration and healthcare. He talks about how the Obama administration had made important advancements to increase healthcare coverage while maintaining the Affordable Care Act which has had very positive results. In the last four and a half years, the Affordable Care Act has helped more than 8 million Americans who, in 2014 alone, received care from the state health exchange. The administration also announced a record number of 12,092,836 new Medicaid recipients and 6.6 million people are receiving insurance on the federal marketplaceplaces. A recent study conducted by the New York Times found that under Obamacare, coverage in the state exchanges rose 20 percent.

As President Obama said on Friday, the ""heartbreak, chaos and anxiety that our country feels as a result of a lack of immigration reform may be what the Republican Party needs right now. It's time for them to give this a chance. They have failed this election, and I know that it will turn out for good: The economy is strong and the border is secure; more Americans are receiving health care, with fewer waiting tables; our communities are getting stronger and more crime is under control by law-enforcement officers and the officers who protect us. This is what America is.""

During the speech Obama talked about his legacy of being President who has worked tirelessly since taking office to create jobs, invest in our infrastructure, create a better American economy, and bring greater respect to the law by making sure the rule of law is upheld. He also talked about his vision at the start of his presidency to restore trust in our institutions, and create a better nation.

"New Batman Comic Features Batman Saving Black Man From Evil Cops Full frontal Leftist propaganda As a side note, writer and artist Frank Miller is also a Hillary supporter Last week anarchists, socialists and Black Lives Matter terrorists joined together to protest against white police officer, Jason Van Dyke, who was already charged with first-degree murder for fatally shooting 17-year-old Laquan  McDonald as video released in February showed him punching him in the head.

In November, protesters occupied San Jose City Market after police arrested a group of six men for allegedly assaulting and robbing the cashier who was selling food there.

After a judge ruled the men wouldn't have to stay off the open road, the men started dancing in public, including holding up signs calling for police to shoot the officers and for Trump to resign. They were arrested after one of the signs was stolen, while another was damaged and one man was injured. The group is also encouraging protesters to join a march planned for today in San Jose.

""You know you want one of these and you want it to happen as much as anyone,"" said one of the leaders, Daniel Martinez, 22, a computer consultant from San Leandro. ""It says a lot that Trump is taking a stand. I think we all need to unite. There's no other option. It's time for the Trump administration to stand up and stand in solidarity with us.""

More than 40 companies have signed a pledge on Trump's campaign website and the Democratic National Convention calling for protests and other movements against his policy proposals. The companies include: General Electric: ""We will not be silent in the face of a Trump administration that will dismantle the ACA with a new, one page replacement"" for Obamacare, they said.

Toyota: ""We support the right of American workers to collectively organize to negotiate wages with employers.""

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said during the Democratic National Convention that ""The movement's leadership, whether we're white, black, immigrant, Asian, gay, straight—it's in our power.""

Pixar Animation Chief Creative Officer Jon Blum tweeted his support for the protest on Thursday and pledged to ""not stop working on our animated characters and the films and shows we love.""

Blaming Trump's ""disgraceful"" campaign promises for the rise of racial and religious hatred is like putting gasoline on a fire before someone starts it. And for the white supremacists there's plenty of fuel left over to spread their agenda of hate and division. They hate us for our country—they hate us for whom our children need to be fed the basic necessities of life because the middle class cannot sustain that type of family living on this planet.

"WOW! VIDEO CAPTURES Angry St. Louis Protesters Turning On Media…TV Reporter Calls Unprovoked Attack: “The Scariest Moment Of My Career” KTVI Fox 2, the TV station that appears to be sympathetic of the Black Lives Matter riots in St. Louis, found themselves on the wrong side of angry protesters today, after the innocent verdict for St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley came down today in the murder trial of Anthony  Lamar Smith.

Here's a look at how the broadcast broke up the protests at the trial:

FOX 2: Hey what's up. We got a very interesting story that comes in here about the verdict for Jason Stockley in the shooting death of an innocent man in St. Louis. That's what we've got live at the trial just as you guys are watching live now. Fox 2 Reporter: He's out of jail, right. What's up? FOX 2 Reporter: Stellan Skota was in a state of shock when he learned a trial would be held today this year, but today he's ready. FOX 2 Reporter: When he was asked if he was ready to testify. He said, ""Absolutely. Absolutely ready."" He was happy and so were the other guys who attended Wednesday's trial, including Stellan Skora. Today the jury found Smith not guilty of second-degree murder for shooting and killing 22-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith and his 26-year-old girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds. Here's a quote by Skoda on how thankful he is for all of those who showed sympathy for and made it possible for the verdict to come down this morning. FOX 2 Reporter: And he's done good for this community. SKODA: It's a good thing, absolutely. FOX 2 Reporter: He's been charged with murder. SKODA: Yes. FOX 2 Reporter: Was at the St. Louis County jail during the trial. SKODA: Well the jury took, I guess the first day I was out, they took me all the way in there because if they were trying to show some respect they wanted to show some compassion. And I was waiting for them to get my lawyer and I came to see him out of the jail. FOX 2 Reporter: His lawyer, Anthony DiCicco. SKODA: A good guy. And then when they went into the room and they gave me the thumbs-up we looked down and I was a step away from tears.

Here are the videos from Fox2 from St. Louis, showing the rioters being detained as if they weren't there.

FOX2: You know, the people watching on Twitter were kind of pissed off about it. FOX 2 Reporter: There were people there who were on the side saying we really appreciate it. FOX 2 Reporter: And we're going to do that in a few days just as we went live. FOX 2 Reporter: So the TV station, we",1

This includes a shift to ""community-based systems"" and more widespread use of a combination of diets with healthy fats, nuts and seed oils to reduce childhood diabetes and heart disease risk.

The report makes for good reading considering how this trend is accelerating, starting today, in areas ranging from the US as well as South America, Latin America, and other parts of Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, including Canada. It was authored by Dr. Karen B. Weisbrod.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NHCDPR) partnered with US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) researchers to undertake a multi-years, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a ""nutritional intervention for children and adolescents (NICE)-led dietary intervention trial (NICE-TRI)"" designed to further assess the impact of NICE-TRI on dietary patterns among children and adolescents.

With the support of several US health organizations, NHCDPR began offering a trial of NICE-TRI in 2010, but the trial design required it to recruit adult participants, and the study population was large. Thus, some of the researchers involved in NICE-TRI research had a prior background at a large public health research institution, where they provided expertise in dietary and weight loss research.

The study was designed, funded, managed, and conducted by the NCHS-sponsored Program for Community Preventive Research (PCPR), which is a partner of the NCHS. PCPR is housed in the Division of Adolescent Medicine at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The investigators of NICE-TRI were Dr. Barbara O. Vollmer and Dr. Robert M. Blanco of NHCDPR's Nutrition Services Division. Dr Blanco is in his first year of his MD training.

Seymour is also, for a decade, the editor-in-chief of the London Review of Books.

The book is a celebration of the 20th century and the triumph of a liberal, anti-monopoly spirit over class warfare—a spirit that has, despite setbacks of late, persisted; to his surprise, though, Seymour was once part of that class warfare, first as the London editor and now as the owner of the Review. Seymour is a self-declared socialist, but he also takes the view that capitalism is the greatest threat to human civilization until it is reformed. Here are some of the highlights of His Own People:

1. The 'Bread and Circuses' of the British Capitalists

The late Edward Prescott, author of the most popular and influential book on American capitalism, came to London in the mid-1960s to try and re-build the American industrial system. He took up the charge, and in 1974, he wrote a book that ran to more than a third of a million words: A Business in Progress. In particular, Prescott argues that in the late 20th and early 21st centuries—the era of the Great Depression",1
"The Democratic Debacle – The Day After 2016 presidential campaign by BAR executive editor Glen Ford The GOP won at the polls, but Black, brown and working class Democrats have been taking a beating from their own party for decades. “The Democratic Party has failed to deliver even small net increments of social justice to its base  over the last 70 years, and has done nothing to fight back against this trend. The 2016 election cycle is no different. In both political parties, Democrats have had to embrace a more militant, white-male identity politics based on race to achieve any semblance of relevance in a country where the gap between the rich and the poor became a national crisis. It remains unclear whether the Democrats will be willing to embrace the social justice message they espoused in the 1960's and 1970's, or whether they will pursue neoliberal policies driven by class resentment and fear of loss. This election cycle is not unique to the Democratic Party. In fact, the Republicans have seen their share of losses over the last few decades because they are in denial on the issues of income inequality, climate change and other important social issues. The Republicans have been unable to win in areas such as education, health care and public safety as long as they continue to blame minorities and the poor and refuse to challenge racist ideologies on the basis of factual evidence. The Democratic Party is the voice of the middle class in America and has a very limited influence on the policies of the federal government because of their history with labor. As a result, Democrats have lost their political viability on issues such as raising the minimum wage, opposing Trump and supporting Clinton because they will not compromise on those issues.

"AUSTRIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM Gives Teen With Homemade Nazi Tattoo Same Sentence As “Refugee” Convicted Of Anal Rape Of 72 Year Old Before we get too far into this story, it needs to be pointed out that the 18 year old teen who was just sentenced by a judge for having a homemade Nazi tattoo, was only 15 years old at the time, and has since admitted he made a mistake. The  teen who posted a ""Hitler"" on the bathroom wall in front of a school in Ohio was sentenced to only two years in prison in May of 2015. We would hope the teen who gave the swastika to a 9 or 11 year old to be the first one who is sentenced for this act of violence in North America. To his credit, the teen pled guilty to a misdemeanor and was sent to jail for 4 months (more is expected from him, even at 14).

They are therefore often considered a prime candidate to participate in a project aimed at preserving these resilient species or even to help them adapt to climatic change. As a result, a number of studies have looked at how bees adapt to climate change, and how their health and fitness is affected. So far, they have focused on four main groups of bees: (1) the monarch bees in north America and New Zealand (including honey bee-hive hybrids), (2) common carpenter bee species and (3) the California waxwings and other honey bee species in North and Central America and Europe. For all four of these groups, previous research showed that some groups had been affected more by climatic change than others, and that some groups might respond more strongly to changes than others. The aim of this study was to assess how bee health and fitness are affected by various types of climate change: the effect on honey harvest as a proxy for the impacts of climate change: we compared health and fitness changes in the honey bee species used for studies with different climatic effects. We measured bee health and fitness in New Zealand honey bee colonies during summer 2014 and summer of 2015 as well as in 2015 in response to the changing climate. We were also interested in examining the effects of climatic effects on other population functions in bees, e.g., queen survival. Using the current research, the impacts of climatic changes on the honey bee and, more importantly, the health and fitness",1

"Prize for ‘Winning’ Frat Bros' Game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' Was Allegedly Getting to Rape a Teen In November 2014, a horrific gang rape allegedly took place at a New Jersey college. The supposed victim: a 19-year-old woman who claims she was lured into a fraternity “date party” by members of Pi Kappa Alpha (PIKE). She's continuing to fight for justice after what allegedly happened to her . In 2011, an Ohio man's sexual assault charge against him was dropped due to insufficient evidence. This is just one of the horrific, but not shocking, stories of gang violence that make headlines.

For all of the media and education that was wasted, there was even more we could have done: From a college perspective, we could have done a better job of training staff and keeping track of the campus life and the students living in there from a legal perspective.

As a result of this, and because of the overwhelming effort, hundreds of new residents have been added to the university since it began opening in 2009. In fact, after a 10-5 season in a small-to-medium-size college, the current administration is looking to extend their term to 2028 in an attempt to keep the campus safe from crime. In their eyes, that seems like the only way to do it.

As of this writing, the administration has approved the construction of a new campus building, new security guard towers, and the addition of two new, five-level buildings. This addition of new units could save the university approximately $50 million in maintenance and construction costs over the course of a 10 year project. But we have to keep pushing to make sure there are enough new units of every type of type in order for the university to continue on with its mission—the safety and security of the students we have all come to rely on to live campus life on this campus.

One of the most recent victims of violent crime on New Jersey's campus was a New Jersey-born student with the last name of Gajan.

At the beginning of January, two men pulled up near Gajan's house and began threatening and threatening him. He immediately grabbed one of the men by his head and pulled him into the back of a pickup while the other man repeatedly punched Gajan and kicked him until he needed medical attention. The man who pulled him over admitted that he struck one of the students in the eye and that he took Gajan's cell phone, and that while they were on the ground Gajan repeatedly said, ""We have to save my life.""

Gajan has been receiving phone calls since that day to find out which one of the men has the knife he used. He had been a regular guest to Gajan's house since he moved in a few years ago. Gajan has since taken it upon himself to help the campus make sure that his family and friends",1

But the next few months are going to be absolutely pivotal. The best receiver available heading into the draft is still to come. So let's take a look at what it's going to take to land one.

In case you missed it, we'll be ranking the top 10 players available to the New England Patriots for the 2016 NFL Draft.

This is not a mock draft. I actually like to take it a bit easy on all of my players. In other words, take away a few extra players and let me figure it all out. If this is going to be a mock draft, this just isn't going to be a mock draft.

We start with the best receiver available this draft, and there aren't much surprises on the table this time around. The consensus top spot will go to North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky. Trubisky will be an absolute steal in every scenario for the Patriots and the top pick in this scenario will take a quarterback with the third pick in the first round (depending on the position). Trubisky was the first guy I picked in this first round, and after that, I was pretty confident about picking him even though his career has gone in two directions.

The pick up of Trubisky with the 12th pick could make or break how great New England would be in 2016. Trubisky is a young quarterback who has never been given a chance in this league and his ability to learn, to overcome, to grow as a player, has been one that many expected Trubisky to get a chance to have.

But let's face it. This is a pick in which I wouldn",1
"The Breakaway Civilisation by Mohsin Siddiqui for the Oceania Saker Blog The US elections much like the rest of our usual daily consumption of Mass Media are more about stage managed theatre with bucket loads of Americanism, a seasoning of hyperbole and most certainly reality-free. The constant barrage of infotainment from the indispensable  American MSM does not actually address or reflect the real issues facing our communities. What little they do have to offer is filtered through hyperbole and political propaganda. In short all Americans do not have a voice. That is not to say the MSM have no influence in terms of who is elected, but it is more about the ""hubs"" they have established to help them shape public opinion as a whole. This article shows how many of the ""hubs"" the American media have created can really only be understood through the frame and lens of American Media. As most of us know, American Media is an extremely political construct. There is little to be gained through the consumption of the mass media in a democracy since the power of mass media rests firmly in the hands of the American Public who are willing to swallow the ""hubs"" and vote their choice for either candidate. And while in the eyes of the US public, mass media are controlled by the American public, in reality Americans vote on Election Day using a system that is much more democratic and much more transparent than what we get from the mass media. The mass media are controlled by those who own both the news media, the cable TV, and the radio. But the public has lost trust in them to be honest and honest about the true issues facing their communities. A major reason for this erosion of trust is the current hyperbolic narrative emanating from the American public that is dominated by the Republican candidate Donald Trump and his allies. While the American Public is willing to believe it is ""honest"" to support such a divisive and divisive candidate, the reality is that they have voted their ""conscience"" for a candidate with many faults and few virtues. For example, Trump has not shown any interest in the plight of refugees in Europe, has not done anything to improve America's reputation as an ethical and compassionate nation, has not pledged to deport millions of undocumented immigrants living in this country (many of whom are living in the United States legally), he has not promised to ""end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan"" etc. But the American public is not interested in his economic or foreign policy statements. The most important aspect is that the American public believe that the American government and the Republican candidate Donald Trump are the leaders of their country and should be the ones to address the problems facing our country. The majority of Americans have given up on the political process to focus on the personal affairs of their favourite candidate who has so far been anointed by an audience who have been influenced by the Republican candidate Donald Trump's",1
"NBC PUTS VIEWERS Out Of Their Misery…Cancels Disastrous MEGYN KELLY Show The initial run of Megyn Kelly s Sunday newsmagazine show will reportedly be taken off the air at least two episodes earlier than scheduled because of her disastrous ratings. Last week, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly set another viewership low with just 2.71 million total viewers. In the last three  weeks, Kelly has had her ratings dip from last week's ratings (4 out of seven live and prerecorded Sunday nights) to a 4.3 in the last three, and 5 in the current week. Kelly's numbers slipped so much after her Monday afternoon meltdown when she blamed the Trump rally in Nevada on Russian WikiLeaks emails for causing the death of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich. The Daily Beast reported that Kelly's show will be off-air for at least two more weeks before it can return to the air with Trump on the show, although she is yet to confirm that she will go to the next network. The ratings slump has caused major headaches for Megyn Kelly; in addition to her new Monday night show coming off a ratings bonanza on her own network, she has been out of touch with her viewers and is now running into significant backlash from the base over her ratings. NBC News confirmed to The Daily Beast that Kelly will stop going to NBC, leaving her off the network's Sunday morning primetime lineup, the Sunday editions of FOX News and Meet the Press, and the Saturday newscasts on NBC, and that she will not attend any special events or host political events.

Kelly's ratings tumble came after a terrible performance on The Kelly File, where she got in her teeth trying to defend conservative pundit Ben Swann after the former Republican Senator had his Twitter account hacked. The Daily Beast reported that Trump had tweeted ""I love that Megyn Kelly took that knee,"" the day before her performance. The show, which takes on Trump in the coming weeks, was viewed by an audience less than half that amount during the previous season. The ratings have not been perfect: as of this writing, the show has only about 2.15 million total viewers.<|endoftext|>Sonic the Hedgehog (2007) - the original arcade game to replace the Nintendo 64

"Cruz & Kasich Quit: Trump Crushes Elite Establishment, #DropOutHillary Now Trending 21st Century Wire says The field is now clear for Trump to become the GOP presidential nominee.Watch a video of this report here:Ted Cruz and John Kasich have both now bowed out of the presidential race, leaving Donald Trump as the last Republican candidate standing.The two failing candidates made their  announcement late this night, as a flurry of news accounts quickly emerged from Ohio about the final stages of Cruz's campaign.According to The New York Times , Kasich announced tonight that he had stepped back as candidate, citing health problems, citing not being able to raise enough money but also because he's too old to run for President.Kasich's announcement comes after he and other Republican candidates have all but confirmed their exit from the race, the only ones left standing are former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who announced earlier this month that he is officially announcing his intentions to run, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is holding firm on his campaign after dropping out of the race earlier this month.While Cruz, who has maintained a consistent low poll numbers, has continued to hold strong among conservatives, other candidates have fallen off his radar.A number of potential Republican hopefuls, including Christie, have left the race after failing to garner the support needed to survive.On the Republican side, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Friday he's formally stopping his campaign and is backing Sen. Marco Rubio, another Florida Florida candidate, and Sen. Ben Carson, who dropped out of the race earlier this month in what some analysts feel has been a sign of strength amongst conservatives in the state.Bush's endorsement came shortly after he officially announced his candidacy.He announced his decision while giving his official statement on his upcoming presidential run on the White House lawn, saying in his statement, ""I will not be the only one looking over my shoulder on May 17, 2016. I hope you, the people of this state, take note and join me on the path to victory. Thank you for being with me, I'll be taking a break from politics but I know that you will continue to count on me.""While Cruz announced late this night that he was withdrawing as Cruz's running mate early on Friday , Kasich confirmed shortly after.

"Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield is Shielding What? | New Eastern Outlook Country: Syria Turkey, in a bid to legitimize its uninvited, illegal incursion into northern Syria, has created several media platforms specifically reporting on what it calls “Operation Euphrates Shield.” Operation Euphrates Shield, according to official Turkish government statements, aims at “securing” a buffer zone in northern Syria spanning from the  Turkish border to the Jordanian border. It refers to the area as “Kosovo People's Democratic Republic\ .

Turkish military operations have included operations in Syria to control its own population, as well as operations intended to defend a Turkish border or to establish ""self-defense"" zones along the border.”

While the majority of the Turkish population, and the population it is ostensibly protecting and helping, are in fact living under the threat of Islamic State-affiliated terrorist groups that have killed and enslaved civilians for years now, the establishment of an illegal buffer zone on Syria's southern coast has had disastrous consequences for the Turkish people.”

The only reason for the operation to be approved is because of heavy Turkish support for Syrian rebel factions and the US decision to assist the Syrian opposition.”

” In terms of what is happening in Kobanê, it's also true that Turkey is making a play to control the Kurds, and are trying to make it very difficult for them to escape.”

In order to do so, the Turkish government has already taken several military and symbolic steps to do so.”

” This includes declaring an almost permanent presence within the territory of the Syrian Kurdish enclave known as Syria Democratic Forces (SDF),” which has been operating against IS militants and Kurds for months and whose leadership has recently released a statement calling for a democratic transition within an independent, democratic Syria”

Turkey has been also taking military and symbolic steps to expand access to and access to its border with Syria.”

So that the Turkish establishment can say: You will not be able to take it to the ground without a fight.

That's exactly what happened today in Kobanê, after four days of intense fighting — the latest action of a Turkish-backed terror operation from which the Turkish armed forces were called out by the Obama Administration (a move that the American people were rightly disgusted) to defend the civilians from terror.”

” In fact, the attack was launched almost three weeks ago on the very day that Obama approved a program to train and supply Syria's moderate Syrian rebels the last known source of money they needed to sustain their ongoing assault on the Syrian regime-forces in Kobanê.”

” Even now, the U.S. has not been forthcoming in saying that the program is illegal and that the funds and weapons they are funneling to the Syrian opposition are also illegal — because these",1
"Geoengineering Watch Global Alert News, November 12, 2016 » Geoengineering Watch Global Alert News, November 12, 2016 | Geoengineering Watch My 138th email to my contact list, titled: 'Dramatic Global Sea Ice Collapse'. 1. Is my E Year of 2024 (suggested just 2 weeks ago) a tad optimistic?: a. Dramatic drop in Global Sea Ice Area: https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/sea-ice-extent-area/grf/nsidc_global_area_byyear_b.png The data has been checked and seems to be fairly accurate/representative. The Global  Sea Ice area by Year is shown below, it seems the world is starting the year to look in the positive direction. B. The decline in Global Sea Ice area may be even bigger than I think, more than it appears. We may be seeing the start of the 'Ice Age'. A global change that changes the dynamics of our economy and even we live in a land of abundance? 2. How can the loss of snow cover (from ice sheets) be connected to global sea ice melt in the Arctic? Are there other causes behind the sudden fall of Global sea ice: climate, changing atmospheric physics? 3. Why isn't the ice over Norway at the same rate as the Arctic? Does it have some influence on sea ice conditions? Does the Arctic play a role in global sea ice? 4. The decline in sea ice is not only linked to global climate change but also our lifestyle choices. Is it just us? Do we have to change our lifestyles? 5. The polar ice caps should be melting as quickly as possible since in the summer times they lose almost 10% of their mass. Ice caps have the opposite effect; they melt faster than they hold. A melting polar ice cap is very difficult to predict for sure. I would like to believe that the polar ice could be 'rebounding' within a year after the 2007 ice retreat. This would be quite an interesting thing to see if there is indeed such an 'epidemic'. 6. It is interesting to read this (link) that if there really are changes in atmospheric physics that could affect the Arctic sea ice. Perhaps we are still facing the 'climategate' crisis. 7. If our lifestyle choices are linked to ice cap expansion: do we have to change those to 'save' our planet and we live sustainably. Also, the Earth is currently in uncharted territory. 8. Did we just lose a little bit of our money, but not enough to get our food. In the meantime the world has to change its lifestyle and become more ecological. Also, more than 70% of the world's water is in the ocean and we don't know when or how to make use of it if the problem is to be fixed. I hope to find some answers.<|endoftext|>The Washington D.C.

" The White House Sets Palin Straight — Her Bad Parenting Isn’t Obama’s Fault (VIDEO) Sarah Palin is an idiot. While this has been commonly accepted ever since she slinked out of her slime pit and emerged on the political scene, Palin recently managed to be so utterly stupid that it prompted an official White House response. After Palin s son Track drunkenly beat his  wife the day after she returned from visiting a woman, Sarah Palin said that she wasn't trying to excuse Track from doing anything but ""playfully slap some dogs before bedtime"". She was obviously not bothered about any consequences related to the incident at all. Sarah Palin's daughter Lola also declared that she could just watch her brother do what he wanted, while she herself was completely clueless, but this was also just what the public needed to hear.

Sarah Palin did not care if she would be publicly identified over the same incident in which a mentally disabled woman died after being kicked in her crotch by her husband. To her mother, she was simply saying what she wanted to be said to her friends. Lola Palin, one year after that, said that Track Palin and his friends beat her and her sister as they were watching tv. As the incident took place in 2005, even though she called it ""tragic' and ""disgusting"" and ""abhorrent"" and claimed she didn't condone it, she did nothing when her mother made light of it all.

Palin's most well-known contribution to political discourse is that she has become an outspoken pro-choice advocate. Since her early days as a candidate during the 2008 election, Palin has made it her mission to try to prevent women from receiving an abortion (she also opposes most other forms of birth control except for the pill). And even though she has been criticized for this, Palin has still stood side by side with her anti-choice constituents on every issue she's fought against, and has actually given her party her ""no"" vote when asked. However, on the day of the most recent presidential election, Palin actually backed a female candidate because women ""have won in the last seven [elections] and they'll definitely win again.""

But you thought that wasn't enough. The following day, Palin took to Twitter to offer her views on the president for another candidate who did not back her up. ""I'm not worried about him as president-elect; I'm worried about him as person,"" Palin added before pointing out that she could have been president if only all of the women supporting her candidate had voted the same way.

""You know, we know we can win, that we can mobilize in this country, to fight, to put people back into the workforce ... But this isn't only the economy; it's the environment,"" she wrote. ""And if we can, I think we can. ... But I just think",1
"OBAMA INVITES David Letterman, Will Ferrell And Other Leftist Celebrities To Extravagant Nordic State Dinner For Purpose Of Sending “Strong Message” To Putin In typical Obama fashion, the extravagant tax-payer funded Nordic state dinner looked more like an after-party for the Academy Awards than a state function. How is anyone supposed to take this ass-clown seriously when he has turned our White House into a playground for the who s who in the  highest circles of American politics?

One of our top-tier Presidential pick is also an ass-clown.

This is one guy that we cannot ignore.

In his opening bid against Hillary Clinton on October 7th, GOP candidate Donald Trump's comments as he was asked about Hillary Clinton's speaking fees were caught on tape and it went viral. As expected, Hillary Clinton responded to the tape with a tweet that basically stated ""No one has more respect for women than I do."" That is a clear red flag for her, because it suggests the truth about Trump doesn't extend to her.

Let us be clear; Hillary Clinton doesn't want Donald Trump to be President. It's just that he's a dick, and we can't allow that to become a problem in America.

I have absolutely zero problem with anyone who likes Donald Trump. My problem isn't his sexist views about women. The bigger issue is Hillary Clinton's lack of respect for her own party.

She is the Democratic Party candidate, and anyone who has not attended at least one of her events in the last two years should be embarrassed, but it doesn't matter. She, and Trump should not be the two of the ticket, for at least another 6 or 12 weeks.

Why the silence from the mainstream media?

Media bias against Trump extends beyond the mainstream media, where everyone knows, as a fact, how many times Hillary Clinton has attacked him, his views etc.

What the media can't stand is when the same people are asked the questions and the reasons why Trump is not as great as they want you to believe, which he never stops raising because he keeps raising, only to be asked about again. They are going to keep asking the same questions and always come back to the question ""Why is he a loser?""

It's like the media is always on Clinton's side because they want to say, ""Well, Donald Trump is too divisive, he's too stupid, and he can't win!"" and ""But Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton's supporters are crazy nutjobs!""

The problem is, the mainstream media thinks that this is how Clinton thinks, too.

We are not here to criticize her opinions, the truth is that many people disagree with these views. Hillary Clinton has already proven to be an ass-clown in the past, but you would never know it by hearing her speak.

I will not forget to mention two other examples of Clinton's",1

The Republican nominee made the announcement during an event at the Washington Hilton in which he discussed the allegations against him.

""This has been an unbelievable effort for me and my team,"" Trump responded to one of the audience members. ""We were the ones who came in to help out and this was a great win, but we wanted nothing more in terms of personal interest.""

The Post reports that Alabama voters will take to the polls this Tuesday to decide the state's senate seat that is currently held by Republican incumbent Jeff Sessions.

When asked if they believe in God or some sort of a higher power, Trump stated his belief in the supernatural. He said, ""Well, if that's God, He does have power because that's where the power comes from and the power is going into Heaven in my opinion. You can never stop who's in charge of the universe. That's how powerful it is. And when you have this, it's a very powerful thing that we have.""

Moore was appointed to the job by the U.S. Court of the Alabama Supreme Court last year after Jeff Sessions recused himself from the judicial nomination process and instead appointed Moore to fill the position. There are reportedly concerns among several GOP lawmakers that Moore would take a harder stance on same-sex marriage than the U.S. Supreme Court. He has also refused to remove signs that express disapproval of same-sex marriage, which many believe could be seen as advocating against his candidacy.

In a press conference at the Hilton this week, Trump told a room of journalists that he does not have a problem with women and that these allegations are an attempt by the media ""to destroy my campaign"" if it proves to be true.

""We have tremendous support now, I think that we've had tremendous support since the very beginning, we have tremendous support, and when you look at people that want to run for office and when somebody like that is running, I think there is never any question that they are going to win,"" Trump continued.

If there is one issue on which you are in agreement, it is that we cannot have a foreign policy, whether it is with the Russians or other nations, that is going to end the world, has to make you less safe, doesn't take into account where this nation is going to be in five, ten, 15 years.""

Paul's remarks came the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin's statement that his country has ""more than enough money"" to defend itself from any U.S. attack. At a press conference last night, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called off meetings with Putin, stating, ""There is one thing which has happened on that, what I will say is I don't think that's right.""

Paul was at the time one of three politicians, including Ted Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul, elected to speak at the New Jersey GOP convention. Paul, whose 2016 presidential campaign failed to attract enough votes in the Republican caucus to win him the nomination, returned to Washington later today to speak against ""socialist realism"" in the foreign policy of both Russia and China.

But Paul's speech and rhetoric today were no less tone-deaf.

""If there is one issue on which you are in agreement, it is that we cannot have a foreign policy, whether it is with the Russians or other nations, that is going to end the world, has to make you less safe, doesn't take into account where this nation is going to be in five, ten, 15 years,"" said the Texas congressman. ""If you go on the foreign policy of a country that is more powerful than Russia or China is, with nuclear weapons, and I hope, we talk about nuclear weapons when you're dealing with each other in that way, it's going to give you no more safety or security than if you had a thousand nuclear bombs sitting somewhere in their sights.""

Paul's remarks followed what he described as a ""hostage incident"" in which US troops held on the roof of a Russian military plane during a routine visit to the base in Romania, to negotiate with the Russians about a prisoner exchange.

Last night, a video surfaced online that appeared to show a Russian soldier firing the machine gun used to kill American soldiers in 2006. As",1
" History Professor Shuts Down Ted Cruz’s Lies About Supreme Court History With Facts Ted Cruz is having a rough week, and now he just received a failing grade from a history professor.Ever since Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia passed away on Saturday, Cruz has peddled the same lie over and over that it has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was  filled. Cruz had already made the case that Scalia died an honorable man, so he had nothing to lose from throwing a cold shower on conservative justice Antonin Scalia. But a University of Missouri professor, who did this as part of an inquiry into Cruz's career, found Cruz had made the claim, but not the evidence:As John Binder of the Marshall Project at the Hoover Institution notes, in doing the research, the professor, Edward P. Lazear, identified three sources who provided evidence against Cruz. Those sources:One, he found, was a 1987 ""History of Texas"" by Eric S. Raymond, a former Texas high school history teacher.""The University of Texas at Austin, which is the state's top public university, issued a statement on April 30: 'The University has no record of any official confirmation to Texas Public Policy at the time of the publication of this book that Justice Antonin Scalia died.' As Professor Raymond has pointed out in public comments during the past several months he has spoken to several members of the Texas Board of Regents and other state officials. 'If this person or a member of the board has a conflict of interest in the book he or she has published,' Mr. Raymond said, 'I would like to know.'""Lazear goes on to tell the story of how the historian's sources had failed to provide evidence that Scalia died a natural homicide. But again, that's not what happened, since he was ""not only correct in one of [Raymond's] details but also in some of his additional references.""But what happened, Professor Lazear says, was that ""the university's public information office was so overwhelmed at the volume of information and so overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information which had accumulated as a result of this book of facts, that they issued a statement in response to criticism that they hadn't been thorough in their response.""""It is ironic that on Easter Day [of 2013] as an Easter egg hunt for our readers and as a reminder that even the most careful university policy would come crashing down on their doorstep, Professor Larry Lazear had published a book that failed to turn up anything on Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia,"" he writes,. That's not to say the professor should have thrown the book out; rather, he just should have told his readers about Cruz's false claim, ""I have never said Scalia died due to natural causes, just that he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor.""<|endoftext|>LAWRENCE — A federal lawsuit is now seeking more than $50 million",1

The burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma  and magnetic particles known as a coronal mass ejection (~CME), the explosion of radiation from supernova remnants that rips open the outer layer of the Milky Way galaxy, moved across space and time. The explosion was so powerful that it shook Earth 2,700 miles to the southwest.

The image measures 2.5billion atoms in size, was produced using the new Cray XSi supercomputer, and was created near a supernova explosion. As a result an unprecedented amount of data was captured of the supernova explosion — over one billion atoms. ""We needed a supercomputer capable of processing 100 petabytes of information per second to get a good image of this huge amount of information,"" said lead author Dr Andrew B. Jagger, assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Swinburne. He said that the image was created to show that the data was accurate and not created with a false colour image. The researchers used a computer model of the nucleus of a proton and its electrons. ""This means we can say with absolute certainty that we have correctly calculated the size of the nucleus because the atoms were accurately predicted out on a computer screen. We can then measure the density of the protons inside each atom,"" said co-author Professor Kevin Jagger, from Cambridge University in the UK. The team has published their results in the online issue of Science. The first image shows the",1
"SAN JUAN MAYOR On Video Disrespecting Our Constitution…But She Takes Our Money [Video] With Puerto Rico teetering on financial oblivion and asking for financial help from the U.S., it s pretty shocking to see the anti-American attitude of the San Juan Mayor in the video below. In case you haven t heard, Puerto Rico is $74 billion in debt after decades of poor  economic management and falling property and other income due to a number of economic mistakes. While there has been plenty of talk that Puerto Rico could be bailed out using the $77 billion in aid that went to it from the rest of the U.S., that's simply impossible as the island is a disaster zone and with very little money available to help.

While it is sad that the Puerto Rico Mayor of San Juan decided to use his own wealth to bully the rest of Puerto Rico into being sympathetic to her own government, the fact that she is such a shameless con artist who uses Puerto Rican property and people to bully this U.S. taxpayer base should give you enough reason to give her a fair shake, right? Wrong. After she was caught bragging about her ""privilege,"" she has quickly run out of excuses how and why all of the trouble she caused herself should not be punished.

Here's what she said:

I'm proud to be in Puerto Rico, and we owe a lot to the United States of America. We're Puerto Rico — we owe this country a lot of respect. And we need more help. I was really excited to come here. And it is wonderful to have access to education on everything, in terms of jobs and things like that, and a big advantage for me and for my family. I'm very grateful. So, I'm very happy, I am very proud, we really are a very rich nation and Puerto Rico is doing great and it needs more help — and I am proud that we can do this and I feel that you will as well as you have in the other states.

H/T Politico.

"HILLARY FINALLY Makes Statement On Sexual Predator and Mega-Democrat Donor Harvey Weinstein…Gets DESTROYED By Bill Clinton Rape Accuser After several days of silence, Hillary Clinton finally made a statement on the disgraced billionaire Hollywood movie producer and mega-Democrat donor, Harvey Weinstein. Well, actually Hillary really didn t come out and make a statement, true to form, Hillary hid behind her former State Department communications director, Nick Merrill, as  she did the other day in a speech on ""American strength"" to the Council on Foreign Relations, which is a non-denominational international think tank.

Hillary, when asked what she thought about Weinstein's comments about women, said the following:

[I] think it is something that anyone who looks at the comments they made would see that it's pretty disgusting. And I think it's really important that we stand up against these kinds of comments, regardless of what the reason for them is. And part of our responsibility as members of the United States Government and as those who come together to talk about these important issues, and our obligation as Americans to protect the rights and needs of all Americans, we must be more than a little outraged by these disgusting statements that he made in these comments. And so it's also important to me to stand up for all the women who have been impacted by these comments, all women – and especially men – who deal with those types of remarks and the attacks that they cause. And I think it is important as a country to call into question so-called victimization, and assault, and harassment, even in the context of the powerful.

Hillary's comments, of course, only make Harvey Weinstein's disgusting behavior more disgusting. It also only makes it more obvious that Hillary Clinton actually lied about what Donald Trump has said about women many times before. In his speech at the CPAC event, Trump once said, ""It doesn't surprise me. I mean, she gets treated badly by everybody, she's being treated horribly."" He later apologized:

In a statement that was released in his original speech, Donald Trump said, ""If I had to pick one movie about a womanizer, it would be 'Florence Foster Jenkins.' I saw it years ago and I don't think it was very nice."" But he then did a follow up on that statement later on in another speech:

Now in his interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Donald Trump said he never called a former Fox News reporter a 'bimbo' before being asked how one would have treated former ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush, who ""grabbed her by the pussy"" and talked about how he could give her blow jobs at his charity event.""

We can only assume that Trump's repeated, repeated lie that the media never reported on or considered this story until the public was confronted with it after it had already been exposed by The Washington Post was an attempt to distract and distract",1

I was surprised by how lovely all the presents were and didn't let myself give up hope. I opened the box first and there was a beautiful card from my secret Santa. After taking a moment to look at it I thought it was very thoughtful. I know this is just an experiment for today, but did you know that my Secret Santa got ME some amazing jewelry?

I got my first set of nail polish from the box with a lovely little card from my Secret Santa. I also got some glittery eyeshadow and polish from my Secret Santa. My Secret Santa got me the nail polish for my friend's birthday and she got me those too! I love this time of year!!

I also received an adorable ""Happy Valentines"" card from my Secret Santa, but because of this, I had to write a letter.

"Project Veritas: Money from Belize | Opinion - Conservative (Before It's News) What the video is about (emphasis added) In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer’s effort. Project Veritas Action had  the funds available for the remainder of the project. Since it was our intention both to give to a legitimate cause and to keep the investigation alive, we did not want to use the funds to try and pressure anyone or to pressure the IRS to go after any political activists based on their political beliefs’we decided that it would be more beneficial to donate the remainder of the funds to a grassroots group rather than make this campaign about us’. This effort paid off, it was funded in full over the next month and a half. While we were waiting we received a call from the New York Attorney General's office, which contacted the FBI to confirm that the donation, though legitimate, had been used for political purposes, yet they were unable to prove how’that money was spent. We found out through our investigation that the campaign had funded it from our own pockets. We also learned that there was money from the IRS that was used to fund the operation in large part through some local police employees. The attorney general, along with the FBI and law enforcement, began examining this money.

RAW Paste Data

Robert Creamer ″From its inception as a non-profit organization in 2009, I have sought and raised over five hundred and thirty hundred dollars to continue working for the benefit and protection of hard-working American families."" The campaign is a 501(c)(3) project. Since no independent third party exists to raise money from for individuals, projects have been undertaken by individual members of the anti-immigration, anti-bipartisan, and anti-big government community ‏in order ‏to pay for legitimate non-political causes and to help raise awareness and money needed for legitimate issues. Project Veritas Action has been a grassroots organization from its beginning and will continue to be so. There is a reason it has been able to get more than four additional chapters in Arizona, Arizona, Utah, and Washington. One of the largest chapters has already announced plans to move to Las Vegas in the coming year. We have a mission that has always been important to our project, and the more awareness we have raised in this country as a result of it the more our campaign will be able to make a difference. We hope that Project Veritas will continue to continue working for the good of the nation and the people we want to help in this country. We have always believed that it is far better to leave the issue at the door. So even if your elected official tells you not to come forward with their unethical deeds, they are",1

"The Red Pill Masterpiece That Predates Them All Like me, you now sigh every time you skim-read the synopsis of the new LGBT agenda-approved blockbuster that the septic tank of Hollywood releases which usually stars: An anorexic AIDS ridden cowboy teams up with a love-starved transexual on a fabulous journey to the Open Borders Districts of America. Carpet  bombs, AIDS, death, and murder: the whole package works and is so enjoyable that those with any knowledge at all of history and the evolution of mankind will agree to it upon reading and watching. I myself would be delighted to be part of this journey.

I feel you, you gay-dork. This is a good thing, you might even like it. That said that I, myself, have not been in many of these films. If there is one positive thing I can say to you, my humble submission, please do find a time to read them, or at least watch and discuss them, I'm sure you'll find many things in between your first and second thoughts. The gay rights issue, however, is such a thorn in the side of those of you who are in their 20's and they're too busy living their lives and taking their children out to play baseball, hockey and football and watching all the big sports like the Broncos, Ravens, Cowboys and Packers. If I'm a younger gay, I'll probably look back and say ""Wow, I didn't know we had this issue and I had no idea what was going on!"" That's because in my 20's. I did know, but I didn't know how many of my comrades in arms I wasn't hearing about it. I knew my friends were in denial. I learned of the existence of the epidemic in my early 20's. Then when I was twenty-three, I knew it was out there—there was something going on. My friends told me about how they'd been diagnosed, and how they had to take their own lives because of it. I realized that that was true too. The truth would make me a sad, lonely and sadist. I had to face some very painful truths for a few months for me to realize that I needed to keep this damn thing in my head: ""What are you hiding for? Are you afraid that someone somewhere is going to hurt you because someone has made the mistake of knowing that you are gay?"" I had to face my reality and accept that this was really happening to me. I was twenty-two years old. It wasn't the first thing that came to mind, but it was definitely the most important. This epidemic and the fear of dying from AIDS really struck my friends like they were about to die: It killed them. So what? All life is at stake. People who are gay are all too frequently killed, injured, and sexually assaulted by other gay people. There are",1
"NFL’S PHONY PATRIOTISM: US Defense Department Paid NFL DISGUSTING $4.5 Million For On-Field Flag Appearances…Welcome Home Tributes Every day, the NFL gives fans another reason to stop supporting them. Although the NFL agreed to refund a small portion of the money our Defense Department (US taxpayers) have paid them to show support for our military, it s the idea that Americans have been duped into believing it  is the NFL we are supporting.

While the NFL has had a great reputation of playing by the rules in the NFL to ensure that the integrity of its games is maintained, I am calling upon the NFL to do the same in the National Football League.

You would not believe what we have to go through for our country. We have to sacrifice every time we watch our heroes fight and die, and the NFL has done nothing but protect its stars for a long, long time. We ask that you respect our American heroes and support free speech. The NFL needs to change, and we demand a change, for they are not our heroes.<|endoftext|>The NFL's rules are designed to force teams to play at every possible location (and thus minimize the number of people making the short drive between camps). Most of the time, those locations don't work quite as well as advertised.

This means a lot of running backs are being asked to stay away from their team's practices, away from their family's lunches. Many have to stay behind locked doors with a guard as they travel from their facility to the stadium. Some coaches have to stay away from camp altogether if they're playing Sunday afternoon. On Sunday, the schedule isn't set in stone, so there's no guarantee coaches have all of the players available or if the coaching staff hasn't taken the time to get to know guys.

The problem is especially acute with quarterbacks. The players get to go over practice dates as often as quarterbacks, but when quarterbacks get on a field of 40 players each the schedules change dramatically.

Here are the biggest challenges for some of these players:

1. Most days the team will get more or less 40 players from practice to the stadium every single day, or maybe even 40. So even if some players miss practice and other players stay behind to give them their warmups, each player needs to get to each practice site to practice (for a full week or month).

2. Most of these players have to travel the full distance between camps. So how many of players do you know who can't make it to camp for a full week or month without being bumped around on their way away from the team and back? It's like having a whole group of people who are all just driving separately every day and every time the train stops on the way. For some players, it's not even the worst-case scenario.

3. Many of these players can't stay at home and are not traveling with",1
" Fmr. DNI James Clapper: Trump’s Russia Scandal Is Worse Than Watergate (VIDEO) James Clapper was the Director of National Intelligence during the Obama Administration. He has been interviewed many times over the Trump Administration s troubles with Russia and his latest statement is sure to make the Trump White House furious that s to say nothing of how Donald Trump himself will  react to this revelation.

On the morning of November 9th 2016, the Trump family visited the White House to welcome Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner back from his trip to Saudi Arabia.

It was on a warm morning at the White House that President's Donald Trump was met by a host of celebrities including a former US President, the then First Lady of the United States, Ivanka and her husband, Trump. Ivanka Trump, was joined by her husband, Jared Kushner, who is now Chief of Staff and President Trump's National Security Advisor. Jared Kushner was joined by his father-in-law, son-in-law and White House Chief of Staff, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.


Jared Kushner, First Couple to Visit US & Visit Saudi Arabia https://t.co/F9q5qOiIgF pic.twitter.com/hqhZ5jRQHk — CNN (@CNN) November 9, 2016

""I think we would never want the Russians or any other evil actors to understand that there is someone that we can trust but they would have to act in the public interest to act in the public interest,"" President Trump told reporters as he welcomed his entourage to the White House.

""We will have a lot of time to discuss it later but I like these guys. I like those guys as people and I just like that they're honest and I just like the fact that they are really looking out for our country.""

Trump added: ""I'd just say that at this crucial time, I am pleased to meet the members of this amazing family.""

""They are also my friends, my close advisers as well. And we are just trying to do our very, very best for our country right now and right after the election.""

The White House would then be faced with having to weigh up the pros and cons of releasing the report, or at the very least denying Jared Kushner a seat in the cabinet on the day he is sworn in.

The day of Donald Trump Jr on the eve of The Donald Trump Jr. meeting was a rather unusual occasion, if ever there was one.

It was reported that a senior Russian official had offered to provide 'information valuable to your father's campaign' as part of a deal in the hope of securing dirt on Hillary Clinton.

" Racist NYPD Cops Threaten To Tase Black Children For Walking Down The Street (VIDEO) Now that Donald Trump is president and Jeff Sessions is Attorney General, racist cops everywhere have free reign to abuse vulnerable groups of people at every turn. The latest incidence of said abuse was caught on tape by Brooklyn College Associate Professor of Sociology Alex S. Vitale, in which New  York City police officer John Pike repeatedly taunted a woman who was being kicked in the face, shoved to the ground, handcuffed, and finally, forcibly arrested for resisting arrest, then charged with resisting arrest and resisting arrest with violence.

""Police officers are supposed to be agents of human decency. That's why when a cop takes that human dignity away, it is so awful,"" Vitale wrote in another article on the incident.

Pike reportedly said, ""I'd rather have you get kicked in the pussy than give her shit like this, because you don't know who you are dealing with, she doesn't know you, a little bitch like the one you're arresting could be more effective than a man with an actual badge.""

The incident began on December 9, when two uniformed officers were patrolling the 500 block of 17th Street while another woman was walking down 11th Avenue when her back was to the officers. When Pike caught up with her in the 6th Avenue section, he began berating her and making racist and other homophobic remarks.

Then, at a stop just one block away, one of the men in the squad car came toward her and put his hand on her hip. Pike then tried to handcuff her legs. As he held her tightly, she tried to turn her back and walk away, only for the officer's fingers to go through her and hold her on the ground while she struggled for her legs and his hand slipped through her.

The officer continued yelling, ""No! I tell you what: don't try to stand, you're going to be choked on your ass, you're going to choke on your ass!"" One of the officers, Michael P. Miller of the 3rd Precinct took several steps back, which infuriated Miller — who was later arrested on assault charges. While he was being led away, P. Miller was reportedly punched in the back of the head.

The officer's partner, Anthony DiCaoo of the Brooklyn district bureau, grabbed a cell phone and ran after him as soon as Miller got out of sight. At one point, after P. Miller had been dragged away, the two officers watched the woman who had been on fire run toward a nearby bus stop, apparently in tears.

""The behavior of the officers was despicable,"" Vitale said of that episode, noting that there is no policy for police to kick in the back of women, ""and we're not going to get any type of training on how",1

Among the proposals were ""complete"" bike lanes on Telegraph Avenue in Woodside at Lake Merritt, more sidewalks from North Concord to West Concord and improvements to a section that connects the downtown transit center to the Marina.

A study on the projects is scheduled to be finished next year and a ""long-term vision"" of them will be drawn up for the Board of Supervisors to vote on this May, Bell said Friday.

There will be more bike lanes in the next year, he added. ""The plan is for 100-year bicycle lanes for most of the area, for one intersection, to connect that intersection with the Marina.""

One of the improvements is a bicycle lane and ""the green way."" It has a bike route from the south side of South Concord Boulevard to the western edge of the area where the bridge at Pine Street crosses Telegraph Avenue. Bell said the green way ""is the safest and best path for drivers to pass people,"" and it will reduce ""the amount of times that accidents occur with drivers who don't have the speed to see cyclists.""

""The bike lane is in our view a tremendous step forward because it helps reduce the amount of accidents",1
" ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Blows Off His Own Leg After Turning His Lawnmower Into Exploding Target Successfully proving that we will kill ourselves before ISIS ever gets the chance, a patriotic gun owner decided that the only way to make shooting his lawn mower better was to also rig the lawn mower to explode. What could POSSIBLY go wrong? The short answer is a lot.David Presley  and his wife bought a lawn mower a couple of years ago. And you know what it is? It was completely unusable.So with the mower's repairman's license, Presley created his own homemade bomb. He loaded up three boxes of bullets, two pieces of pipe, one piece of detonator and the detonator itself into the mower, and drove to the yard on Wednesday afternoon to put it all together. And sure enough--all things working perfectly.Then, when a 911 call came through telling Presley that his lawn mower was already going off inside his house at about 8 p.m. Tuesday night, one can only assume he did his homework. He realized that, yes, the house was already being heavily damaged by ISIS. Because, you know, it could destroy buildings and everything else.Then he and his wife took a quick dip in a swimming pool and realized they were gone. So they went to an ATM, gave a few dollars to the ATM operator, who then withdrew about $12,500 from the ATM, then went home, got some pizza and ate it. Well, the rest of the day is good as far as Presley's family is concerned.So yes, the Presleys did have some success with this one. The idea is that the mower went off in a certain place on their property. But he hopes that he was successful in getting ISIS to actually see what they're doing, since at the end of the day he's trying to make the world a better place.<|endoftext|>This article is about the story event.

Lifespan for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans may depend on the level of activity in the brain, new research suggests.

Researchers suggest a person's risk could be higher if they suffer an early decline and do not have brain activity to compensate.

A further link to risk was suggested in people with mild forms of AD.

The research, led by the University of Kent, is published in the journal Neurology.

Scientists analysed brain scans of about 100 people who suffered Alzheimer's on their first diagnosis and after three and a half years of treatment, and looked at the impact on brain activity.

The researchers found that older individuals were more vulnerable to the development of the disease.

They also suggested that certain parts of the brain can be more vulnerable to disease. The team suggest that these should be considered when making treatments tailored to individual risk.

This group of individuals may be more likely to benefit from treatments that focus on removing blood from the brain that accumulates.

They are suggested drugs that stimulate certain types of protein in the brain and can reduce levels of the protein, known as amyloid beta in Alzheimer's.

"40 Years Ago Ronald Reagan Warned Us About Obama In This Speech [Video] I d like to suggest that there is no such thing as the left or right. There s only an up or down.  The human mind is simply not able to handle either side. The same can be said for most people around the globe. We are just trying to decide between going left or right, left or right, right or left. We have no idea how to do this with a human mind. And even if we could, that has never happened in the past. We simply have not been allowed to. The same goes for governments. They only have that power and their laws, which come directly from God. It is a sad state of affairs when you consider how the laws and laws are supposed to be designed by Almighty God to protect us. But instead, they are designed to be completely useless to mankind. All humans are criminals and must be punished severely. God created mankind perfectly for this purpose. But in order for us to be perfectly safe, we must do the only thing we know how to do: obey God. This only works if we have the means at our disposal. If we cannot be physically harmed or injured, God will not be responsible for any of this. In reality, if everyone can only obey when they are physically harmed or in danger and God says so, the government will become unnecessary and the government will simply become a tool of Satan. However, we must not allow our government to become that. If a government official violates the law by failing to perform their duties when they are legally mandated to do so, that is simply wrong and should not matter. For example, if a doctor does not properly administer a medication for someone who suffers from depression, the doctor does not violate the law by not giving the patient a proper medication. The same is not true if a police officer will arrest someone if they fail to obey a police officer's orders. This is also just wrong. It is also not possible with the law at all. All law is based on the laws of the universe. All people are created equal. This is why it is so important to teach our children that they deserve nothing but what they are legally entitled to. Only because Jesus died on the cross was he allowed to be born into the world. This was not the first time he was born; in fact, from the beginning His birth was unknown to the world. Therefore He was able to bear the responsibility of killing all the sins caused from all the previous times of the earth's existence. We must keep our hearts filled with love for Him to ensure that we are not condemned. One of the reasons we must keep our hearts filled with love for Jesus is because the heart of",1
" WATCH: Kellyanne Conway’s Latest Gushing About Trump Will Make America Vomit The wicked witch of the White House makes America sick again.As we all know, Donald Trump botched his first visit to Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey by basically holding a rally and bragging about himself without once talking to a victim of the storm or surveying the devastation . He then spent his entire weekend at a club in Palm Beach and had at least 8 people in tow that had been in town for a wedding, but didn't leave until 6am. After he finally did speak to a woman who had been waiting for her wedding dress in their hotel parking lot, he said that it was because she couldn't find her dress online. I'm not saying Hillary isn't a monster, but it's a lot better because she didn't have to take away anyone's wedding day.Trump's tweets were an attempt at humor, but you can't say that about Hillary Trump, who has now caused so much injury and destruction in such a short period of time. I think he was only trying to bring out his base of supporters who are frustrated with everything.It's not as if Trump hasn't been making these outrageous comments on Twitter for months, maybe even years. His followers have been calling him out, demanding accountability on his tweets when he doesn't respond, and claiming he was not a human. His ""victimhood"" is now being used offensively against Trump. He has been accused of being racist and not being concerned with getting his job as president done with enough focus on jobs and making America great again. This is disgusting.There is no excuse for someone who doesn't have any intention of serving the country to get up every morning and say these things. I can tell you the kind of things Trump says. They were shocking because they were so far gone I was actually surprised that Hillary didn't respond to them. There is a difference between being outraged and being offended. And yes, I am appalled that Hillary Clinton didn't respond.As you will have seen from the list I included at the top of this post, there are a few women that Trump insulted and one individual that he called fat. While that individual's views are not racist or sexist, this is enough for me to say this was enough for Clinton to respond. In my opinion, these are the kinds of comments that should not be made in office. Hillary has shown time and time again that she doesn't need anyone to listen to her or her supporters when it comes to making policy, but she is absolutely not above the scrutiny of voters and the public.That will be up to the American people. And that's enough for today.<|endoftext|>On March 18, 2016 at about 1 p.m., a black female in her 20s walked past one of three small yellow signs advertising Starbucks coffee shops and the first Starbucks coffee chain in Atlanta.

WASHINGTON — For the first time in decades, more young people are supporting Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump in New Hampshire, a new national poll has found.

Fifty-four percent approve of the job Clinton is doing in the state, while 43 percent have an unfavorable view. That's a 6 point edge — the first time since 1993 that Democrats have led Republican presidential candidates by that margin.

Story Continued Below

More than 80 percent of younger voters say they want Clinton to be president, a significant increase for her over Barack Obama at the same age group who supported him in 2008 (65 percent, Clinton vs. 41 percent, Obama). That's a huge shift, particularly among older generations who still favor Clinton.

Young adults are much more likely to say they can name a single member of the Democratic Party who would take the country in a new direction more than say Trump could do so (76 percent, Clinton vs. 10 percent, Trump).

There are signs the youth factor is driving down the other candidate among independents. Forty percent back Clinton, compared with 40 percent for Trump. About three-quarters of independents — 76 percent — prefer Trump.

The poll also found young people are more likely to side with Democratic voters who disagree with the party's tone on foreign policy, but much more likely to favor Democratic politicians on issues that have become flashpoints for Republicans in recent years, such as the fight over immigration. Twenty-five percent of young adults think Trump may change a policy or get involved in political battles ""so much that I would vote for him"" if they tried.

In all, nearly three-fourths of young adults across party lines believe Trump has the right policies, according to the survey of 1,000 adults from Sept. 15-21.

"Lasers, they are truly upon US. link So we have laser defense systems being used by the US Navy... Ponce became the testbed platform for the Laser Weapon System (LaWS), with installation of a prototype weapon system for field testing in August 2014.[29][30][31] In December 2014 the United States Navy reported the LaWS system works perfectly,  as its initial trials demonstrated that it can defend ships from a variety of threats such as guided missiles, cruise missiles, and anti-ship cruise missiles.[32] In mid-2013, the USS Independence, which provided a key role in testing the LaWS system, also conducted an extended flight test of the system, using LaWS to defend against guided missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles.[33][34] The USS Independence is currently using LaWS against cruise missiles.[35]

In 2014 Japan also signed on to a new military relationship with the US in a major shift in how the international community is viewed in the eyes of Japan: In January 2014, the country's defense minister, Itsunori Onodera, pledged to increase cooperation in defence matters, promising joint assistance in the field of countermeasures (covert and electronic), and ""enhance cooperation between our military forces"". This has meant an extension in Japan's defense budgets in the past two years.

For the past six years the US and Japan are the only two NATO allies to participate in joint air and missile defence systems, the second such agreement after the Netherlands.[36] Japan is also part of a Joint Air-Land Battle Task Force (JAGTF) consisting of six nations, consisting of Japan, the US, Israel, Netherlands of the US and Spain.[37] In May 2014 France and Japan signed a joint naval task force agreement in June.[38]

As part of the alliance, NATO's alliance in Africa has begun its second major project since the end of the Cold War, which aims to improve security in the Horn of Africa. NATO's African Command will coordinate patrols in Africa and contribute soldiers on the ground to a permanent presence. The project's purpose is to develop a maritime security chain of command that will maintain a continuous presence to fight terrorism in the region and to protect the continent in the context of a global threat.[39] The goal is ambitious – the mission will span seven African countries, with a mission footprint that will enable its participants to meet their security goals in addition to being capable of supporting each other and the international community.[40]

In March 2014, the European Union announced its intention to add France and Italy as its 27 members, while China joined NATO as its 18th member. This new arrangement allows the EU, a member of the EU, to share defense-related capabilities in the European sphere of influence, rather than with its NATO partner.[41]

"WATCH: SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN Tells TMZ Sports Reporter He’s Okay With NFL Players Disrespecting Our Flag John McCain really doesn t care what topic reporters ask him about, he only cares how President Trump feels about it, so he can take an opposing view. If President Trump agrees with a social or political issue, McCain disagrees with it. If Trump disagrees, McCain thinks it s a  big deal , so he won t stop defending Obama s policies , as I reported this week.

Trump is President Obama ' s No. 1 foreign policy priority, so for McCain , any negative reaction to President Trump is part of the president s foreign policy. McCain wants to fight Obama for decades to come. His plan is to have Congress take up a repeal-and-replace bill and force the House Intelligence Committee to vote on it , and a replacement bill to pass the House without a vote.

McCain wants a vote at all. Democrats oppose the repeal-and-replace bill, but their members will vote up and down . Even if a full 56 members vote no , it would still be one vote short of approval. So if Senator Flake doesn t get the 60 votes , and we lose the replacement bill in the Senate by 60 or more , it will be dead in the streets

And, in my opinion, Senator McCain doesn't want this to lead to war , because he thinks Trump needs 60 or more votes , but instead he wants a Republican President to defend policies Obama s had a hard time coming to terms with, so if we lost the fight , we would be just as angry, and Trump would be just as angry .

This morning , Sen McCain told reporters, "" I can go to another place and find out how we can do great things in the government ,"" because ""It will be a battle that I've been doing for 30+ years."" This morning , my friend and former colleague at WND , Dr. Bob Perry wrote an incredible feature at the Huffington Post about McCain and his plans , which you can read here .

Dr. Perry says McCain wants the GOP to fight President Trump all the way up until the Supreme Court , not just on health care , and so the GOP must not allow the "" Trumpers "" to do what he has been doing all along, which is to try to convince President Trump to oppose the President's social and political policies .

""And the plane can only take a certain number of passengers.""

It took doctors, nurses and patients about six years to learn how to make such a transition and get used to new techniques for performing surgeries that would help all people.

Some of the techniques have been perfected since, but many have stayed with doctors for several decades, the researchers said.

""Our experience has been that they are the best of all the things that you can do in the emergency room,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a professor of emergency medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved with the study but was familiar with its methods.

""This is how they will probably have to stay in the emergency room,"" Dr. Fauci said.

In the future, the researchers wanted to learn what the technique will cost, particularly when they tried to apply it elsewhere.

The researchers used the new technology to remove an 80 cc sample from the chest of an obese 18-year-old patient who had died of anorexia nervosa, with the assistance of a computer-generated robotic arm which could move, walk or even turn its head in response to the patient's commands. In the study, he was not wearing a breathing apparatus.

The patient, called James, had been in the medical complex since the age of 2. One of his legs was attached to a harness attached to a machine which was designed to remove the patient's body fat. Dr. Schatz said that his arm was made and controlled by the software, which used",1
"UNBELIEVABLE! Students Succeed In Removing US Border Patrol Agents From Career Fair: Concerned They Won’t Make Illegal Students Feel Welcome This is not some small obscure community college. Disallowing our law enforcement to attend a school sponsored event in favor of protecting lawbreakers is a BIG deal! This school with over 30,000 students has managed to marginalize these brave men and women who put their lives on the line every  day to uphold the ideals of our system of laws and values and bring our great country together.


I think it's time for our college community and the rest of America to wake up. We must have these types of events again. If our university cannot host these types of events now, then they will no longer have a seat at the table at our country's table. I know I am not alone in thinking so. Just this past Tuesday, we had the University of Michigan Student Assembly (UMASMA) and we learned that they had agreed not to attend any future events on the list that has been compiled and approved by the president of the school.


""We will not support the administration's decisions, which are unbecoming of the University of Michigan and inconsistent with the purpose of our public institutions,"" said UMASMA President Robert Osterman in a statement.


I cannot stress enough that there is absolutely NO basis that this group of lawbreakers should be allowed back into our institutions of higher learning or even allowed to return back to our community. We as a community, our higher education system and our law enforcement agency have become increasingly ill at ease with how our system has been hijacked by lawbreakers, criminals and rapists who are now being welcomed back to our country by our government who are doing little to prevent them. The American public is growing and changing because of this so we must find an alternative to the current failed system and continue to stand up for its ideals.

I also wanted to share this video by David Ransome.


UPDATE:

I want to offer another piece of context to what's going on. This was not a university event.

There was no need for federal help at all in this case. This was a violent terrorist attack on a school. You might ask why the government would intervene in our domestic affairs when we have armed thugs on the outside? Well, that's a whole other story. For now, let's focus on facts.

As I said at the top, this situation is a huge threat for our republic. Every day we lose members of our own armed forces, our country loses our freedom and our country loses the ability to defend itself from criminal attacks at home.

October 28 – November 1, 2016 It is time for us to come together and tell the universe “We Are Ready!!!” The upcoming period from Friday, October 28 through Tuesday, November 1 offers a wonderful chance for us to assert  our will. We know that our bodies are not always healthy when there's intense stress. But the stress does not have to be in excess of your capacity to deal with stress. You can also focus on the good moments and remind yourself that your life is full of joy, pain, and sorrow. You can choose to feel the joy of your family and friends and go on exploring all the opportunities. You also have the ability to choose to feel the painful moments and let your body be there to help you through them. The last week of October brings a time for reflection on life events. How did a life event affect you personally or professionally? How does this impact life in general? How do you cope with all the problems in your life? How do you deal with the things that are not worth dealing with? How does the process to find your balance in your life change? How does learning and sharing positive behaviors influence your life? How do we learn how to be confident? What does self-love mean that is necessary for success? What is it that allows you to truly accept who you are and create happy and successful lives and families? How can you express your love? When can you start feeling proud of your body? When do you recognize and accept yourself? You learn to accept other people. You learn when to let what others say and do affect your life. Life is a journey, not an event, and many changes take place within our lives. All things change and so must life – the path, the process, and our own sense of ourselves. Remember, your goal is to be happy “you may not be in love or have a perfect relationship yet. But if you accept that, what happens when the journey ends can change your life. As a Buddhist we know that you cannot live only for yourself. You have to live for all people who are like YOU who share in all the benefits of living for all life circumstances. Our purpose in this life is to build up and encourage all of your people to come to embrace and embrace the journey of your life.

"BOOM! CUSTOMS AGENTS IGNORE Obama Appointed Judge’s Court Order…ENFORCE Trump’s Travel Ban On Friday, a federal judge in New York issued an emergency stay temporarily halting the removal of individuals detained after President Trump issued an order to ban immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.The move appears to mark the first successful legal challenge to the Trump administration and  the nation's refugee policy. It also comes less than two days after a federal appeals court upheld the immigration order issued by President Obama to stem the flow of refugees and immigration to the U.S.The lawsuit was filed this month by lawyers representing the families of four Canadian citizens who had fled persecution in their home country of Iran, who were then barred from seeing relatives in the United States.The order bans nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Syria from entering the U.S. for 90 days, and suspends the admission of refugees indefinitely.It also applies to lawful permanent residents (Green Card holders) in those countries who are traveling to the U.S. It also blocks citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Syria from adopting U.S.-born children.The four Canadians sought to intervene in the legal challenge to the refugee order by filing a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York on Friday. A judge ordered that individuals be detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 90 days and not admitted back to Canada.The lawsuit was brought by an Irving-based American lawyer, Matthew Miller, who earlier filed a similar lawsuit in 2014 on behalf of a family of six Iraqis from Baghdad who had fled to Canada and were denied U.S. entry because of concerns about their immigration status.The judge rejected the three other lawyers representing U.S. citizens detained by the Immigration Department, who argued that the Department of Homeland Security should have the ability to remove the individuals at its discretion.The decision came two days after the ruling by a three member 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel that upheld the ruling by the Ninth Circuit on July 24, 2016 , saying that the government's motion to block their removal was ""plainly arbitrary"" and violating the Constitution and the rule of law.The appeals court's ruling came after the judges ordered the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detain the clients in Canada.

The Sith Lords wanted revenge for the deaths of Darth Bane and his apprentice, Master Darth Tyrone,[4] so they set their sights on Bane, who the Sith Lords believed to have become too powerful to suppress and kill him. They succeeded in their goal, although it ultimately cost them the lives of several of their own. Terrence was eventually freed by Tarkin during the Sith attack on Kamino, and he followed his father's example by joining with Tarkin to defeat the Dark Lord.

Early life Edit

""I wasn't always a Jedi father."" ―Kylo Ren [src]

Terrence was born on the planet Kamino in the year 9999 BBY to Tadec and Terrence Terrence.[3] His parents abandoned him and his mother in order to escape Darth Maul's Sith occupation of the homeworld of Kamino.[1][5] Terrence began to wear a blue armor that would not fit into his typical suit of blue-rimmed sliver skin and black helmet. Instead, he took the name Terrence and chose his true identity, Darth Bane. Bane, like his apprentice Tyrone, possessed powers so great many Jedi Masters didn't understand.[5] Darth Bane was also described as having a voice that sounded like Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord known for his voice. After being freed by the Dark Lords, Terrence had learned that he could no longer kill the Sith Lord who had placed him up for destruction. Instead, his powers were shared with Tadec Ter",1
"AUSTRIAN PARENTS AND TEACHERS Sacrifice Young Girls At Liberal Altar: Teen Refugees Sexually Abuse School Girls For Months Anyone up for a European vacation? How about sending your young daughters to Europe to study for a semester or two? Is this the end of the tourism and study abroad business for America s youth? More reports of European countries sacrificing their young girls on the altar of Islamic  law is making a lot of noise. The fact is young Americans are no longer willing to allow their daughters to go to other countries where they have been taught the Quran. These children are being sacrificed so that their parents can raise them as ""true Muslims"" living and studying among the same people. While you can continue to go on holiday with your husband or wife, but when your children are indoctrinated by these false religions, the day of joy becomes a long and difficult journey that will surely not end well for many parents. These children may not be Christian or Jewish or Muslim because these are not religions of faith for them. In my opinion, parents do what is best for their families but we should not abandon our children in the name of religion.

We don't need to teach our young men what to fear or what to pray in the name of. It seems the young people of America are being indoctrinated by these false religions that teach Muslims what they really believe. Those who think like this in America are living in one of the worst indoctrination centers in the world. I cannot tell my own daughter what to do, but I can think of only one thing she should do after years of living and thinking like this. The best thing she could do for herself would be to leave the country. As mentioned before, the government and the media are being more and more in the control of young people. We Americans who choose to live in this country should live and think our own minds without the influence of anyone outside to influence our lives and choices. After all, if you are willing to live in a society that is dominated by a false religion of Islam without knowing what is really happening, where are you going to go and what is right and what is wrong?

If you would like other readers to contact me, I would appreciate this and you may like to add me on Facebook or email me. And if you are looking for advice on how to survive these horrible new schools of Islam that we are entering, you may like to read about my recent book on the history of Islam (here), which was inspired by a true story I came across in my own search for personal advice. It is not easy to take on the power of this new version of Islam; it is a very harsh and demanding brand of Islam that is not in tune with the way humanity can and should work. If you think I have helped or given you valuable advice and experience, please feel free to share.

I like the term, because it seems to acknowledge the natural environment and its many connections to the physical world. A healthy forest may be home to numerous trees – pine, pine fir, evergreen, cedar – providing refuge from the elements. But we don't hear many Americans acknowledge that much of that forest has become overgrown with lawns and other forms of landscaping. That's a shame. It's a shame because it means we've failed to understand nature as a refuge.

It's a shame because we often forget that the human experience is unique with regard to all things we enjoy. And although a forest has the same capacity to offer a safe haven from an outside world as a home, there is a human response that should not be overlooked. When we allow ourselves to be guided by nature as our guide, we might learn a valuable lesson that could help us be truly grateful for all the blessings there are in this world.<|endoftext|>As the number of children growing up under an abusive home atmosphere continues to rise, there are steps the parents can take to protect them from future abuse at the hands of their children.

According to Statistics Canada, two-thirds of children under the age of five exposed to abusive family members are currently victims of child abuse or neglect. But it turns out that this level of abuse among families is not unprecedented, and may have actually jumped in some recent years.

In 2014, for example, only 14 years earlier, 18 per cent of families experiencing child abuse or neglect were now living in a home where children were physically or psychologically abused or neglected, according to Statistics Canada data.

In 2006, the figure was 31 per cent; in 2014, it was 40 per cent. In contrast, for every increase in",1
" GOP Implodes As Trump Launches Nasty Public Fight Against Top Republican (TWEETS) Donald Trump is continuing to dig himself into an even deeper hole in regards to the horrific racist attack in Charlottesville, Virginia.After Trump has been blasted for his weak response by pretty much every politician including Republicans he s taking his critics on. At 6:19 this morning, Trump decided to  give the president-elect an opportunity to explain himself and defend himself in regards to the violence at Charlottesville . Here are a few things that Trump has come out on defense of over and over again with this weekend.It is obvious that Trump knew nothing about it until Friday morning, when he was asked by a reporter to address claims he said during last Friday's presidential debate, ""Well, you know, I hate to tell you, I got to be honest with you. I didn't say it. And I won't say it again unless I'm allowed to.""What he has been doing is taking every opportunity he can. After Sunday's presidential debate , in which Trump was accused of not saying the words ""both sides"" correctly, Trump went full Trump in defending his original remarks. His spokesman, Sean Spicer , who at one point was asked by a reporter whether Trump was a racist, refused to answer. When asked again, it became obvious that the president-elect knew absolutely nothing about racism in Charlottesville or his plans to be president of the United States.When asked again whether or not he condemned the KKK, Trump said, ""I did it again. And I'll tell you what I'm going to do with them, you know. I'll bring them to justice, and they'll learn their lesson, OK?""When asked again by the same reporter if he condemned white supremacists or neo-Nazis, he said ""It shouldn't be that way,"" then went back to attacking Hillary Clinton and her ""crooked"" campaign.Trump went on to say that even though he is ""against bigotry and hate of any kind,"" there might be people who are racist. ""I'll say this much though, it doesn't get me elected. You know, I got great crowds when I'm campaigning, you know? I win big crowds, I have great crowds."" The president has been able to make his comments that he should not be president without getting ripped for it. His lack of understanding of what is going on in his own country does not bode well for any of the actions he proposes.

Trump's comments could be a preview of what he will do in regards to his own agenda after winning the presidency.

We are going to have to be the first generation that makes choices in regard to our nation and our children to look through the mirror and be honest about who we are and why. It's time for us to put our hands to the wheel and make the tough choices. It's time for us to stop being afraid to",1
" Karma Comes For Trump, Congressional Committees Want To See Comey ‘Tapes’ (TWEETS) Donald Trump s lies and empty threats are finally catching up to him. Just a day after the hearing of former FBI Director James Comey, Committees in Congress are announcing that they not only want to see Comey s memos of his conversations with Trump, but they also want to  read his memos. That is a real problem.

The Trump administration wants to read what Comey wrote in the memos. Not just to determine what is in those memos, but also to verify whether it is accurate — that is a real problem for the FBI . Just last year in New Orleans, a woman accused five of her high school classmates of sexual harassment. They were exonerated by a judge due to new evidence in each case, but, once the sexual assault statute was changed in 1993, the new statutes were changed, meaning the sexual harassment cases were thrown out. Now, the FBI is in question.

It is now likely that at least some of President-Elect Trump's claims against President Obama will be investigated in Congressional hearing after congressional hearing by investigators looking into whether Trump used false information to gain the presidency in 2016. When asked by Congress who would be the special counsels, Comey refused to answer. It is now expected that Trump's claims about Obama may eventually come to light in this hearing.

A week ago, Attorney General Jefferson Sessions asked Comey, what the Justice Department is doing to look into Russia's interference in the election. Comey didn t say anything and he said nothing during his confirmation hearing, yet, it appears, he is investigating President Trump for lying about whether Barack Obama was wiretapped by President Trump.

There has not been one piece of evidence to confirm Mr. Trump's false claim that he has been wiretapped or that President Obama wire taps him but there has been plenty of evidence that President Trump is a liar who has been proven to be wrong in his claims. And it is only a matter of time before President Trump will receive another investigation by the American people because it now seems that there is no other option on the table but for him and his supporters to engage in obstruction of justice.

The American people need to come out to the hearings and tell Congress whether the American people expect that the Republican Congress will conduct what we've seen this year; that they are going to act as the independent police force of both the executive branch and the courts to pursue the truth and the facts.<|endoftext|>I'm just thinking about all they do for these games.

" THIS Is Trump’s Definition Of ‘Fair’ Media Coverage (VIDEO) Trump hates the media with a passion. He often rails on Twitter, and at his rallies, about the dishonest media, and the dishonest coverage they give him. He complains that he s been treated very unfairly by any media outlet that doesn t immediately shove its head up his ass,  a comment many people on Twitter interpreted as Trump's insinuation that the mainstream media was not giving him fair coverage by treating him fairly on the campaign trail. When Trump began campaigning for the Republican nomination for president in July 2015, media outlets began to report that he was suffering a ""fainting spell"" as he was being treated improperly for a ""serious illness."" The only media outlet that dared report that Trump's campaign manager would deny anything was CNN. There were many other outlets that never tried to report on Trump calling the media ""FAKE NEWS."" Trump, for his part, was critical of the media, often tweeting and retweeting articles from outlets like the Daily Beast, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal and New York Times.

Trump tweeted at Hillary Clinton several times on July 26, 2015, asking why she didn't run, and he wrote: ""Hillary has taken money from the world-ending global special interests and nothing you just wrote is going to solve it. You know it very well!"" He continued: ""Do not let up the attack on @ChelseaClinton & all that she stands for. They have made a deal in bizarroland - the DNC, Hillary, and the Clinton Global Initiative, to get the nomination from her."" He also wrote that if Democrats ""have taken your vote, I hope they pay you back. No money down time."" The tweet drew swift responses on social media: @HillaryClinton: ""Well, now she has your money."" ""@realDonaldTrump: Now she has your money. She deserves it.""<|endoftext|>We know that the United States was founded on the principle of the rule of law. But there's one aspect of that, from the perspective of American exceptionalism, that we tend to miss altogether, one we must always remember to bring up for our children and grandchildren: the centrality of individual rights to the American democracy.

That's why Hillary Clinton, during the 2016 Democratic presidential primary campaign, made a key point. As she said recently, ""Our government will not always play by the same rules."" That promise is vital to the continued viability of a representative government like ours as we come face to face with the threat posed by terrorism around the globe. And it rings increasingly true as the world becomes increasingly polarized over the question of whether to act or not.

The notion of the United States as an example, an example of its founding ideals, is hardly lost on many countries around the world—and it's no surprise that its people, once inspired by its example, would want",1
"You’re Fired! Trump Wins Big, Clinton Is Going To Jail Via Yournewswire Let the swamp draining begin. And when the murky stench begins to clear we all know what we will see – a bloated, slimy creature called Hillary Clinton shivering in the shallows. SPONSORED LINKS Removed from the corridors of power, she won’t be able to say “I don’t  deserve any forgiveness’

Hillary in the bathtub

The Clintons have always been the most comfortable people in politics. This year, I'm not sure why. Hillary won, and she won for an election cycle that was about as exciting for America's progressive ideals as she ever dreamed of. She's a warmonger, her husband was an evil terrorist, and in the last four years Americans have heard her campaign speak not just to black and Latino voters and men, but to women and gay people, working class people, people with disabilities, seniors who have seen their incomes stagnate, and the middle class, working family voters. That's why the next four years will be about her. But the Clinton juggernaut of political power is far more than a personal triumph. It's also a dangerous juggernaut, the engine for a dystopian vision of America in which a handful of corrupt, corporate-connected players rule in the shadows, while every woman, every human right is curtailed.

Hillary had the ear of everyone in her party, and she did so with gusto. But her policies for the middle-class and working-class have been in her favor even since the beginning of the century when she ran against a Democratic senator named Tom Peevey. Bill was elected in 1994 and a decade later, he began his first term as a Republican governor; she would return to the Senate in 1986. In 1988, she won the nomination for president, but she was challenged, by a third-party candidate, by the Democrats and lost in the general election.

It was the first time in history that there was a person on one side of one political issue who was so unpopular that he could lose her campaign. Bill and Hillary were never shy about saying they wanted a new way to organize the federal government, that there was nothing they agreed with more than what they supported. And while Hillary worked to make sure her image and reputation would be preserved, she made no attempt to explain how her politics fit with her own. That was why her image was so precarious as her husband began his second term. She needed votes for the presidency. But after her 1992 presidential campaign, the Republican National Committee fired her campaign manager, Tom DeLay, a man who had served in the Reagan administration and had been in business in the private sector as a consultant. In one sense, he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, because a number of Clinton supporters were convinced that no Republican could win the nomination and that Clinton could",1
"BREAKING: Federal Judge STOPS Obamacare Transgender, Abortion Related Protections O Connor found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit because they have presented concrete evidence to support their fears that they will be subject to enforcement under the Rule. WASHINGTON A federal judge in Texas on Saturday issued a nationwide injunction halting enforcement of Obama administration protections  for transgender students, in a case challenging President Donald Trump's policy. The injunction, issued on the morning it was filed, comes after officials said this month that Texas faced potential federal lawsuits for refusing to allow gender-segregated restrooms and locker rooms, or denying service based on a person's gender identity. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, requested an injunction Friday seeking to protect transgender students who would need to use the restroom and shower facilities that correspond with their assigned genders in schools. The Trump administration is threatening to terminate federal funding for the Obama administration's Safe, Accurate, & Efficient Access to Schools program unless Texas and 29 other states comply with federal regulations. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, a coalition of students, organizations and a Texas public school district, include Gavin Grimm, a 12-year-old girl who was expelled at Gloucester County School District's P.E.A.R.E. in April after refusing to use the boys' bathroom, and Michael Thomas, a transgender male who is serving as the district representative for North Carolina's Panera Bread and who lives in Austin. ""The federal government's continued failure to enforce its civil rights laws against Texas will harm innocent children and endanger federal funding,"" Paxton said in a statement. He added, ""Texas should have the right to make the important decisions that affect its kids, not to have the federal government force them to conform to their sex identity."" Paxton's office said Thursday that federal law requires all states to provide students in bathrooms that correspond with their identified genders and to ""ensure that public school districts comply with local law and comply with their obligations under federal civil rights laws."" Last month, the judge in the case asked Paxton to rule on whether the plaintiff would have a legal standing for the lawsuit if he or she applied for a Title IX office.

The judge, William H. Clifton III, who is presiding over the case, said in his ruling of Friday night that ""the federal government's continued failure to enforce its civil rights laws against Texas will harm innocent children and endanger federal funding."" The judge, William H.

They claim the woman in Dallas was targeted, but as more evidence emerged that she is black, the KKK went after her online, too, calling her actions ""hate speech."" And on Saturday, KKK members took to Twitter to call their followers to attack Clinton supporters. ""We need real hate in our country! The Clintons have sold their souls!"" wrote one of the group, posting pictures of Clinton in a KKK robe and a skullcap, captioned, ""Haters. KKK. A-ha!

But this was worse than last election. In the past day alone, Trump supporters have shouted racial epithets, burned down a black church, attacked officers, and even attacked anti-racists during peaceful protests outside of Donald Trump s election rallies all over the country. And to think, if the Ku Klux Klan were still around to throw racist epithets in the faces of people without a racist history and without prior support, all you'd need to prove is white folks didn't support Hitler in World War II!If there s a single group of hateful people out there who are responsible for the destruction of lives, that s what they will be when it takes over America.

Ben Shapiro is a 33-year old conservative who has every right to speak. Watch live-the speech was scheduled to happen at 7:00 PST California time (running a little late):S.E. Cupp interviewed Shapiro about  his experiences fighting fascism in Ukraine. She asked him about his views on anti-Semitism, homophobia, and racism. Cupp was not impressed with Shapiro's views on the antifa movement in the US. I'm sorry, I have been reading this video for more than five minutes. How is it possible that the world has forgotten about Ben Shapiro? How are so many mainstream liberal pundits not defending him? How is it possible to defend such a right-wing figure? Shapiro's comments about the antifa are nothing short of shocking. The leftists are trying to shut down the free speech rights of conservatives; they are trying to silence anybody who doesn't agree with leftist ideas. They are trying to destroy free speech itself. Ben Shapiro is right. If you care about the future of free speech, you must support Shapiro's right to speak.

Ben Shapiro is the author ofThe Political Landscape: American Political Movements from Reconstruction to the Present and a member of the Young Turks commentary team.

"PAMELA GELLAR GROUP PLANS TO RUN MUHAMMED CARTOON ADS ON DC BUSES [Video] Drawing Muhammad is not illegal under American law, but only under Islamic law. Violence that arises over the cartoons is solely the responsibility of the Islamic jihadists who perpetrate it. Because freedom of speech is under violent assault, the human rights advocacy group the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) has  teamed up with CAIR International to appeal its prosecution and seek leniency for those who defend freedom of expression.

""We think the trial courts would have acquitted the defendant for insulting the prophet,"" said Nihad Awad, an attorney at the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI). ""This case could have gone to a jury if not for Mr. Awad. He has been a friend of the case and has provided legal assistance. The court is going to have difficulty trying this case in a traditional courtroom.""

The trial court trial began with charges of malicious prosecution, for which the defendant and his defense attorneys had the maximum possible possible sentence of two years in prison. They appealed, but the appellate court rejected their arguments, and handed down an 8-0/2-0 sentence that included all the time already served in incarceration.

""We will appeal and try again for a very long time for what was just a slap on the wrist for somebody who committed no violent crime, no hate crime,"" said John Cady, one of the lawyers who worked on the case.

The defendant, Faraz Khan, is an American citizen, born and raised in Ohio who was born in California to Pakistani parents. He entered law school in 2002 at the University of Iowa and moved to Indiana after graduation. He entered practice in 2000 and then moved to Illinois in 2003, where he has worked more broadly.

In his initial plea, Khan said that he was simply calling his criticism of the depiction, which he said depicts the Prophet Muhammad as one of the most murderous human beings alive today, a ""hate crime,"" and that he had meant only a crude satire based on the idea that he and his co-conspirator, cartoonist Ben Affleck, were in league with the terrorists who had massacred cartoonists at the Jewish newspaper. In closing arguments, one judge, Mr. Thomas, asked Khan if he knew what he thought about the ""war on terrorism"" and the cartoons. (Mr. Khan is currently a partner at the firm Akin Gump, Cinsley and Wagner.) In response, Khan referred to the United States as the ""murder capital"" and the ""murder capital of the world.""

A police agency who investigates reports of child abuse can arrest you for ""any offense that would rise to the level of a crime punishable by imprisonment or a substantial fine,"" according to New Jersey's criminal procedure law.

How do police decide which offenses fall under that standard?

While a police chief may issue an arrest warrant, the judge or magistrate may make that determination based on a variety of factors, such as the seriousness of the offense, the circumstances surrounding the arrest, and a judge's ""reasonable need"" for an arrestee to be detained under the standard.

Are there any limitations on which offenses can be charged on the basis of a conviction for a crime of domestic violence or sexual misconduct?

No. It is illegal for anyone -- including police officers -- to arrest and hold individuals who have committed domestic violence or child sexual abuse, depending on circumstances.

""If you find somebody with a violent history, you can arrest that guy,"" said Michael D. McKean, executive director of the New Jersey Domestic-Violence Coalition, which is supporting New Jersey officials from the Department of Public Safety and Department of Human Services to investigate a domestic violence-related incident.

""But if you take a guy down the street, or even a guy down to a bus stop, there is no limit,"" McDKan said. ""In my research, I've never found a statute, no rule that has any mention -- ever -- of that.""

Is there an ""unofficial"" statute that makes it illegal to arrest someone based on a domestic-violence or sexual-misconduct report?

The police and criminal justice systems have often been accused of overstepping the bounds set forth in state and federal law.

That's not what the statute's plain language implies, McKean said.

""It's a general law,"" he said. ""It says that anybody has the right to be heard and have their constitutional rights respected.""

"COMMANDER IN CHIEF APPROVED RACISM? U.S. Military Makes SHOCKING Disciplinary Decision For 16 Black West Point Cadets Do we even need to ask how 16 white West Point cadets posing in uniform, with a white power fist before graduation would have been resolved? Never mind the media circus it would have created Sixteen black West Point cadets who posed with raised fists for a pre-graduation picture that  had absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the picture. It wasn't even about freedom of speech; the cadets' fists were just as inappropriate as they were over a white cadet's name. It wasn't an issue at all; the issue was their choice to wear the uniform or not to wear it. It doesn't matter to these students whether black, white, brown, Asian or Asian-American they can have their identity affirmed and the decision to do so respected; this is a choice to be made based on a colorblind worldview. They chose the wrong path and went with a racist ideology that will continue to affect them and their families.

One more thing: as I pointed out above, the black students were not forced out of the black campus by any ""racial discrimination policy"" and were allowed to join. In fact, they were welcomed by the school and were treated nicely and with respect from their peers, teachers and many at the school. Their identity was affirmed under the leadership of a professor who has repeatedly demonstrated her support for students of color while trying to silence others and has engaged in a long history of racist speech and behavior. If she had removed the black students from the school, then why were she welcomed so generously and what was their motivation? For this to even happen after the president, the university president and even, the white professors and students who supported the black student, had all gone along with this racist and violent rhetoric, then these students need to have their students removed and investigated by the Office for Civil Rights as well as the Department of Education and FBI immediately. No one should have to live through a school that continues to treat students as disposable toys and their classmates and professors as objects of hate.

Now it's for white students to step forward and condemn the action on the part of this Professor.

White Nationalism and Hate Speech

What about our students who are attending and protesting the events? Do they get in line to support the protesting students? No, because it's not true: they are encouraged to support the protesting students via a list that is published each morning on the school's website. Not only does the list not include any names of the students taking part in the demonstrations or the white supremacist groups who have supported them, but it also contains lists of students who are either students, alumni or friends of the protesting students as well. This is not a list of students who have no connection to the situation. It is a list of students who happen to be affiliated with the students",1

""One of the problems with drugs is that people believe that when drugs are used in less harmful or less harmful situations — that doesn't mean that's what's going to happen,"" he told CNN Wednesday. ""It might be that in the US, if you get a prescription from your doctor and that you're using marijuana, they might say, here it comes! This is what you're in for; you need to get it now! So we know that's wrong. This is not an experiment.""

For Carlin, the US Supreme Court's decision against medical cannabis in 2012 meant ""drug war"" was no longer being waged, but the idea that ""we're going to punish parents"" for choosing this over alcohol, tobacco or alcohol abuse ""is absolutely wrong."" But for the state attorney general's proposal to take effect, he said he can do nothing to stop the state from doing so.<|endoftext|>By Sam Smith on April 18th 2012 at 11:33 pm.

If there is no ""Flaw Free"" word for it, then you won't like it

I'm still trying to grasp the concept of a ""frightened-up product"" and what that means (when it comes to this ""frightened up"" iPhone?) The product does sound scary, but as one might expect it's all about safety. Yes, some of the features are ""bad"", and they're a little annoying at the beginning. For example, the ""lock screen alarm"" sounds, but it's a very silent alert and doesn't even sound like the ""wake"" that you are used to from the iPad (therefore, it feels like a very silent phone call, but a good warning that not to leave any stuff behind).

We have the new ""Lock screen alarm"" on an iOS device of a similar price (that's why the Apple brand) for around $5, in addition to the existing alarm feature (it does alarm, it doesn't sound). The problem is, it sounds like a phone call (the ""Lock screen",1
"Coke Zero: What Went Wrong With The Marco Rubio Brand? Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireAny business expert will tell you that marketing is not an exact science. The same is true in politics, and even more so in this historic election season. As the polls closed yesterday, Republican candidate and US Senator Marco Rubio took to the podium to announce  his primary challenger, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. As he spoke, Rubio announced that he wouldn't be running, despite a series of endorsements from the very people Rubio has so often criticized – including the president and the mainstream media.


""I am leaving the GOP today,"" Rubio told his supporters at a press conference earlier today. ""I think this is a time for humility. I'm leaving to join the debate and to make the arguments to explain my campaign. I think every Republican candidate, including President Bush, has got to stop with the attacks on each other and join hands and start to work together to create consensus and to advance America on the things that we care about."" If Jeb Bush were a Republican, it might have been a great way to start the debate over how he would spend the majority of his time on the campaign trail. Jeb Bush certainly wasn't, and the former governor ended up dropping out by the late afternoon hours. ""I was disappointed in the way the debates were handled by the Democratic Party, not only because they missed opportunity to take away some of the momentum for our candidates and for our party from this summer primary, but they also put politics over the people in those debates,"" he said last month in Colorado. ""I would like my campaign to not have to spend months, if not years, fighting a battle that we could be winning right now.""


The only Republican candidate to accept the invitation to debate was Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Tuesday night. Although it was an unprecedented step and a departure from prior debates, a handful of GOP candidates were still on television Wednesday, including Senator Ted Cruz and former Governor Bobby Jindal. There were also some notable exceptions, even among the very Republican candidates:

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is expected to face a Republican field of six candidates if he becomes the GOP's presidential nominee, admitted that the Republican Party was in a bit of a ""debate paralysis"" on Wednesday. Paul spoke on the same day as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who told the crowd that ""the party is in a debate paralysis right now because the debates get taken over so quickly."" While Rubio may have been the last candidate standing among the other candidates on the debate stage, most Republicans would probably agree with Rubio's assessment that the GOP debate problems are not over at all.

Paul, who is polling well in the Republican primary, told Fox News that the fact that the two major parties had failed to make substantive differences on immigration reform is a sign that",1
"Experts Recommend Breaking Down Crushing Defeats Into Smaller, More Manageable Failures - The Onion - America's Finest News Source Experts Recommend Breaking Down Crushing Defeats Into Smaller, More Manageable Failures Close Vol 50 Issue 20 · Lifestyle SANTA BARBARA, CA—Offering advice to those who feel overwhelmed at the thought of becoming massive failures, a group of experts reported this week that the best way to approach a crippling defeat  is to consider it as manageable. ""If you know you have to deal with it, keep telling yourself 'There will be time on your hands to think through it and come back to me with solutions, but only if you are ready for that, no matter what it takes,' "" said psychologist John M. Pescatore, a graduate of UCLA's Department of Psychology and author of The Psychotherapist's Toolbox. ""If that fails, you have no choice but to deal with the defeat rather than continue to believe it's 'not my problem' and not want to put something in place to deal with it."" Responding to the report in a conference call with subscribers, Pescatore continued, ""It's just the way I always approach things. If it feels impossible, I'll look it up; if it's difficult, I'll make sure to ask for some help; if it seems like it won't be fun, I'll try not do it. Don't be afraid of setbacks, make them go away, and let them bring the others back to us. It all makes sense to me."" While Pescatore's advice makes sense from a cognitive-behavioral perspective, some members of the Psychotherapist's Toolbox—including a medical anthropologist, a certified clinical social worker, and an organizational psychologist—agrees that getting to grips with a debilitating or crippling defeat shouldn't be relegated to the realm of rationalizations. Rather, they argue that if dealing with an overwhelming defeat is your goal and needs to be treated at all, it's more important than ever to build a mental model of what went wrong and how to fix it. For instance, if it's clear from the perspective of your opponent that you're the one giving them a hard kick, then you've just lost—but if that's true in the short term, then you need to do the opposite of what you did and make your next move as if you were victorious. ""At this point, there's nothing you can do for the person and if you want to win, you have to make that decision,"" said psychotherapist Amanda Geller, whose own clients regularly talk their way out of situations that feel hopeless and difficult. Pescatore, who has worked in the field of clinical social work since 1991, says that the only way to deal with an overwhelming defeat is for the victim(s) to come to terms with the facts and, in return, understand that their situation has been created by a mental illness rather",1

Credit: Wikimedia Commons Researchers from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University today announced a study that uses data from hundreds of patients with autism to discover the genetic basis of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).

This research, which was just published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders is one of many efforts to track down the cause of autism, which is thought to be a complex and debilitating neurological disorder. The researchers are now developing strategies to help people living with this disorder and other diseases understand why some have a greater risk of developing the disorder.

The study examined a small area of New Britain, Connecticut, a large industrial city in eastern New England. About 20 percent of the residents of this section had autism or a high risk for developing the disorder, and the risk was nearly three times that of the general population. In addition, there were over 50 autistic and non-autistic children in the study. Because they were so rare, the researchers focused on what are typically healthy children of the same age, as well as those who had developmental disabilities.

When researchers looked at genetic and environmental factors linked to autism, they identified four known autism genes: a brain version of FTO, a protein that helps the nervous system regulate motor function, and NOS (nuclear factor of activation), which activates various processes through which the brain responds to stress and injury. The researchers determined that the area of Connecticut in question with the highest autism prevalence was also the place with the lowest levels of environmental pollutants associated with autism.

""We found a high number of areas with the increased prevalence of ASDs where the autism prevalence was also much higher compared to the general population, suggesting something in the environment is causing that increase,"" says lead study author Sarah Brown, who conducted the study alongside Dr. Michael Rosenblum, a director of the Broad Institute of MIT, Harvard University, and elsewhere.

"Syrian Refugee Receives RIDICULOUS Sentence For Trafficking 13 and 14-Yr Old Girls While On Bail For Raping 17-Yr Old Political correctness and open-borders are a dangerous combination. This story is proof that Europe has officially ceded their nations to mostly Muslim refugees who have no intention of assimilating with their citizens. Progressivism is actually killing Europe.The percentage of Muslims in Europe has been rapidly increasing over the past few  years. The Pew Research Center estimates that Europe's Muslim population will reach 6 percent of the population by 2030.

This means the EU already has Muslims in their midst who will no longer welcome the Europeans because they have become their ""own little people."" The EU is also a threat to America, as President Obama said on July 7. Obama said, ""There's going to be pressure on Europe to take back their borders."" He explained, ""We're going to have to create a new kind of politics that works for people outside of our borders.""

A few weeks ago, Obama told Bloomberg News that he thinks Islam poses the biggest threat that America has ever faced. He explained the threat as, ""If that happens, we're now going to see the most significant change in U.S. demographic history. Europe will either become a majority-Muslim and absorb large numbers of Muslim migrants and integrate into a new European culture, or it won't. And the United States will no longer be the only country facing a diversity crisis that demands a sense of national identity to survive.""

It's also important to note that Islam already threatens Europe. Muslims attacked the Jewish people in Rome two decades ago. The problem is that Obama did nothing, and the Muslims now live in places where American troops and NATO officers are still on patrol.

At the same time, our military is doing its most important mission to protect innocent lives — by being a terrorist threat.

After 9-11, the Taliban invaded Afghanistan. They captured hundreds of thousands of American dead and tortured many of the children of American women and men. But they did not get hold of the Koran, which is how we gained the knowledge that the Taliban were so evil and our ""war on terror"" was actually a global jihad.

And now, the Muslims live in France, Germany, Sweden, Austria and beyond.

We should not have to live in fear and fearmongering. The only reason to fear Islam isn't because it is a religion, but because it is a Muslim people. A ""minority."" A ""minority."" A people who do not even respect themselves.

The Muslims in Europe want to take our freedom. They want to take our lives away. They want to take our culture.

Our Muslim leaders want a ""Muslim homeland"" of their own. A Muslim country. A Muslim America.

As our government takes thousands of innocent people from Europe and forces them to live and work in another country, the",1

""If the government of the president had not done what they did, that would be the subject of an investigation,"" Holder told reporters at a conference in Brussels.

Holder added that he didn't think the information collected was particularly sensitive and that even if it did contain evidence of wrongdoing by Trump employees, it was irrelevant, since the US government had a history of keeping such records.

""It raises concerns about the propriety,"" he said, adding that it raised privacy fears because someone who may have information on the White House staff needed to take it to the authorities first. ""It's hard to believe Congress is going to accept such information given what we know on the level of the national security apparatus already,"" Holder said.

A senior White House official told US media that the executive order signed by Trump on Sunday was an effort to put the focus on the ""harsh sanctions being put on Iran that will take place over the next days but will also impact the stability of the entire Middle East region."" The official also refused to deny reports that the sanctions could be implemented immediately.

The sanctions, implemented on Monday, affect some 30 Iranian companies. Congress last year unanimously passed the nuclear agreement by the US, which led to an end to the Iranian nuclear program immediately after Obama's signature on April 6 last year.

The White House spokesman on US-Iran relations, Ned Price, did not respond to US media's query about the alleged data collection by Trump's team.

"HOW PEOPLE MAGAZINE COVER Proves Hillary Has ALWAYS Been Wildly Unpopular With Women Does anyone else get the sense Hillary is not quite as popular with Americans as the media would like us to believe? She can barely fill a phone booth with supporters at her rallies and the activity with her social media accounts pale in comparison to Donald Trump s. Will  she do well in the primary? Will her poll numbers fall again by that point? Will she make it to the general election? It seems to me it will be difficult.

To those who wonder why ""the mainstream media"" would ignore Sanders or even mention his supporters, keep in mind this: They are the same establishment-controlled media outlets that have spent decades trying to keep him out of public life, which is why they didn't cover his speeches in Iowa. By the time they learned Bernie Sanders was going to campaign against ""millionaires and billionaires"" and push for ""a $15 minimum wage,"" they were already being accused in Politico of being liars.

To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has warned against banning coal fired power plants because it will produce pollutants that will harm our health and the environment. In order to achieve that goal, we need cleaner coal plants and better technology that can produce coal at lower price. These technologies can come from clean coal plants, coal-fired power plants, or a combination of the two.

What Are Coal Plants?

We can think of coal as a fossil fuel. What makes coal a fossil fuel are four chemical transformations: natural gas, burning of coal or lignite, petroleum refining, and coal mining. Most coal plants use the first two or two processes to produce coal. Other plants use coal as a gas. The second and third procedures use lignite to melt down the coal and form a liquid, known as water. The third process uses petroleum refining to refine the coal to use as a fuel.

The reason coal power plants don't produce harmful health and environmental pollutants comes down to the nature of each coal plant's operation. The coal used in U.S. power plants is heavy duty, which provides the necessary stability on the power system. To be consistent with safety standards and avoid health or environmental problems, coal can use less energy when operating at high pressure and temperature.

Coal plants will also operate",1
" Hillary’s Latest Challenge To Progressives Is One That Needs To Be Taken Very Seriously (VIDEO) Appearing on Face the Nation this past Sunday, Hillary Clinton was posed a question by host John Dickerson surrounding voters and how many want what they want, even when it comes to their candidate of choice. Dickerson insinuated that Hillary may be trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the  race because he is not the party's choice. When asked whether he is concerned about her running behind Trump's numbers with Hispanics, Bill Clinton pointed out that Hispanics are going to be voting for Hillary.

On Face the Nation, Bill Clinton said:

We're hoping when the Hispanics come out of the woodwork on Election Day, they will look at this and see that the system is rigged to ensure their success.

Bill Clinton said that Hillary has to win the popular vote, but will ultimately be disqualified by voter fraud.

Hillary said in last week's debate that Bernie Sanders has a serious problem with Hispanics and he wants to be the choice of all Hispanics, and Bill Clinton called the comment ""irresponsible."" He said:

Hillary has a serious problem with Hispanic folks, and I think her message is one of economic empowerment, education, opportunity, and I think her appeal is one that many folks who may not share her values would agree is very relevant to a country of the middle class.

Bill Clinton added:

She'll eventually put that aside, because they are not going to be willing to take the job she has put in front of them. Now, the one thing we can't have do in our political system is we are not the party of people who are willing to give up an individual's ability to vote when their party's nominee does not agree with the same issues that they're supporting.

When pressed by Dickerson, Bill Clinton stated that if Hispanics get behind Hillary, it would be ""hallelujah"" and he predicted that, if they support her, ""people will say: 'It was her turn to say something, let's get behind her. This is not Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton could be president of the United States. We need to elect Hillary Clinton.' So she's the woman to go with that platform.""

It would be very strange for a Democratic candidate running to win the presidency to be so vague about her plans to appeal to Hispanics. In fact, the Obama campaigns and Hillary Clinton have both offered similar proposals for how they hope to win Hispanic voters, which has left many of them skeptical about their campaign.

On Tuesday the Obama campaign released a ""plan for Hispanic Americans,"" entitled ""What Can Obama Do for Me?"" That plan contains several ideas focused on the needs and the needs of Hispanic youth, including:

The discovery was made shortly after midday, according to a NTSB news release.


The victim is identified as 58-year-old Johnnie Langan, the first person killed on board. He was reportedly travelling on a tractor trailer that had been damaged in a minor crash earlier in the day when he collapsed in his seat. The NTSB released the name of the deceased after reviewing an interview with the victim and investigating the circumstances of his death.

The person discovered alive is believed to be a man whose body is still on the roadway after being found at 5:40 am on the shoulder of the Interstate 95 overpass in Cliftonville at the corner of the I-95/I-676 interchange. The woman, identified as 49-year-old Amy Broussard, was on a second trailer with one passenger when the fatal accident occurred. The passenger was pulled off their trailer and taken to hospital. A passenger in a similar truck who also experienced a similar crash was taken into care of the local New Brunswick police as a precaution.

The driver of the truck had a blood alcohol level of 0.17 per cent when he was found next to the fatal accident. A Breathalyzer device was taken by emergency crews on scene as a precaution.

The cause of the crash is still under investigation.

Traffic was affected for several minutes after the accident.

NSB officials say there have been no other traffic related crashes on the roadway that were related to the collision.

The State Bureau of Investigation is providing more information as it moves forward in connection with this fatal crash. The cause of this crash was fully investigated and further investigations are likely in to the circumstances surrounding the accident, in particular to determine if there were other factors that could have contributed to the crash as the investigation plays into determining whether or not an employee failed to yield or if the accident was deliberate.

But it was the Democratic supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, who were most visible, and the protesters held up signs that read ""Hillary! Vote Bernie! Trump-I am not for illegal aliens in our country. #DemExit""

When one protester asked for clarification on the Democratic Party's position on immigration, which opposes Obama's executive actions, she received a dismissive response.

""He thinks the president is in total control over everything and he's taking away our guns and he's taking away our freedom,"" protester Aisha Brown said. ""What we need is a party that is actually going to stand against the Republicans and fight this war.""

Brown continued: ""Do some damage control on deportations, because these men that voted for him are our heroes today, because they came to this country to work, for a living.""

Protesters hold signs during the RNC protest near Tampa, Florida.

Brown, along with two other Trump campaign protesters, who were wearing the message from Occupy Wall Street before the convention, were arrested and charged with disturbing the peace.

They were released after a judge said he was satisfied their actions did not ""unduly strain relations"" between law enforcement officers and the group, a Tampa police spokeswoman said.

The group's sign, which read ""Fight the Republicans, Not the police"" was displayed atop a large banner hanging from a pole, over a banner from Black Lives Matter.

More than 100,000 people lost their lives in Syria as a result of a devastating war, UN figures show.

At least 30% of them died of starvation, with many others suffering severe physical injuries.

Almost 800,000 were killed in four years of violence. Millions have been forced from their homes.

The majority are refugees from other countries.

Nearly half of them are girls and men, and many are children.

Many of the casualties occur in the war-torn southern city of al-Qaim, where one UN report found that ""children are being sold to fight, and women are being used by fighters as sex slaves"".

""The UN says the number of civilians forced into sexual slavery has risen from 5 to 10 million since the beginning of the conflict,"" said the BBC's Danny Shaw in Beirut.

"REPUBLICAN PROPOSES HOUSE BILL TO FORCE Supreme Court Justices And Employees To Join Obamacare Of course, we d be okay with excluding three of the Justices who didn t go along with the rubber stamping of Obama s reckless socialized medicine plan. While we re at it, it s only fair for Barry and his family to be forced to use his signature Obamacare  program and, therefore, his tax exempt status while they endure this humiliating fate.

So let this be our lesson on Obama's hypocrisy. The American public needs to stop being fooled by promises of what the ACA will deliver and instead recognize that they are stuck with this charade until President Trump proves otherwise.

As I noted in a recent Daily Kos article, the ACA, while it has had the appearance of universality and universality of effect for almost all major healthcare issues over the past 50 years, is now serving as the foundation for what will soon become a plethora of failed Obamacare programs that will ultimately cripple millions of Americans.

I think we should start by eliminating all executive orders to implement the ACA without Congressional approval. This will eliminate any potential for government overreach with a small but still significant number of executive orders that could, for example, allow the administration to implement a health reimbursement program where the government reimburses hospitals for a portion of medical spending paid out.

One option could be to pass legislation in Congress to require that private-sector insurance plans include comprehensive benefit plans in which the ACA requirements and benefits are clearly and easily understood, yet insurance plans without them still could find themselves being underpaid for services by underpaying providers and potentially being subjected to costly claims processing hurdles and other challenges that are common on most Obamacare programs.

Another option would be for Congress to pass legislation (and the President to sign), requiring the president to submit to a legislative oversight body the cost projections made for every of 100 new Obamacare regulations enacted over the next two years. At least one congressional group already has been considering this as part of legislation to repeal Obamacare. For example, in a recent report from The Fiscal Times, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated Congress will spend $3.5 trillion on a variety of initiatives over the next 10 years (that is, about 14 percent of the budget that is budgeted to be spent on federal programs and 16 percent for the programs and agencies within the federal government. In other words, by taking a careful look at the entire federal budget, which is actually roughly half of the total in the fiscal year and the remainder that is not budgeted for) the CBO projects that the total cost of Obamacare ""by 2020"" will be $549 billion. The bill they released last week contained the following section: ""The Department of Health and Human Services shall submit a report to Congress describing the progress made against its fiscal objectives under the Affordable Care Act.

Of course,  Ellison's Democratic counterpart won't accept the offer.So Trump then followed with a series of insults against Ellison that include mocking his religion, saying he was more of a Muslim than a Muslim, suggesting he was more of a Muslim than a black man he's been compared to before and a few more.<|endoftext|>Crazy, crazy, crazy. This is where we're about to go from here. We've just announced that we've teamed up with Marvel Comics to bring you the next edition of Captain Marvel, on sale June 21st.

You wouldn't know it from what you do, but Marvel Comics has been working for years to produce the next title in their ongoing Spider-Verse universe, known as Captain Marvel. Back in 2015, the team began prepping for that comic in the hopes of having it ready for production by 2016, but the wait was nearly two years. And just as Marvel had been making progress on their plans to bring Cap to life over the last year or so, this is what I'm writing:

As Marvel told Comic Book Resources last fall, they wanted to make sure Marvel Comics was prepared to bring a new storybook series to the comics market. This meant bringing us our own run of Captain Marvel in November 2015, in which she's teamed up with Spider-Man to fight crime in New York City and the Marvel Universe once again—even if she doesn't do it super-villainically. This was a huge deal for them, because it meant that, for the first time in many years, readers would get to see Spider-Man's love for Aunt May, but it was also a huge step on a road towards what we can expect from the series, even before we know anything else about the events of October 2015. In short, the Captain Marvel prequel in November would be a huge step forward from where we ended up.

We're ready. There is no better place to start than with a sneak peak at the pages below. Look for the full preview of Captain Marvel #1, coming out on June 21st, before it's released. (That cover is really, really good—and I love its art, too!) But I'd also like to let you in on a bit of what the Captain Universe needs to be. It's a good time to be reading the characters, and there's a pretty big reason the series begins after Captain Marvel #1 and goes all the way back to the events of February 1998, the first book in the Amazing Spider-Man",1

" Trump Took Federal Money Meant For Small Businesses Affected By 9/11 Attacks Trump is a millionaire who clearly doesn t need federal money for his businesses, but he took it anyway, even though it was supposed to go to small businesses that were devastated by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.When the twin towers fell that day, it did significant damage . But as you might expect, Trump said he would provide tens of millions of dollars for charities working with orphans. In fact, many of those working with children's charities have no money. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum recently found that some of its funds were diverted to fund work for people with cancer. The president said he will provide a gift of $5 million ""in the form of personal contributions to help pay for such charity.""But Trump, whose vast personal fortune has helped him gain support in the media, didn t say how much he would give, a spokesperson told ABC News ""When you are so rich that you can afford something like this you're going to give something back to others -- and it wasn't for your own personal benefit.""The Clinton Foundation, which Trump founded and has endorsed, also seems like a likely location in which to give money. A foundation spokesperson told ABC News ""we have no involvement in charitable events."" But the Trump Organization could make a charitable announcement in a Trump-like way.The IRS has yet to issue new guidelines for charities. The Trump Organization has said in the past it could set aside up to a third of its proceeds as charitable contributions.As for Trump himself, he has said he would give up his entire net worth to charity, but when pressed about where that amount might come from, he only gave a very vague, ""a third of what I have."" Trump told CNN he made ""no statements as to where and with whom.""<|endoftext|>In recent months, the news has been filled with speculation about how this year will affect the NFL draft. This is a time for the NFL to be transparent, just as we saw in the NFL Players Association's 2014 Pro Football Hall of Fame ballot. With this past June 1, 2014 deadline, I would like to see the NFL do something about the NFLRSS draft website. After all, this is a crucial time for pro football and the players. It is a time when our current president stands on stage in front of an audience in an audience that has made him a global star. It is a time where his record will speak volumes about his standing and character.

So, with this in mind, let's start by discussing the process by which the ""NFL Draft News"" page was created.

When I first contacted the NFL, I told them that the page was to have nothing to do with draft weekend activities, such as player appearances (for example, the Super Bowl) and interviews. The NFL responded by saying that the league",1
"THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT WHY OBAMA Is Planting Muslim Refugees In Small Towns Across America This is the best explanation of why Obama and the Democrat party are fighting so hard to keep the US State Department s Refugee Resettlement program going strong. Please share this with everyone who s been wondering why the Democrats are so eager to bring Muslim immigrants from countries who  are known for their hatefulness and criminality back into the US!

Watch Below:

Follow Ryan Saavedra On Twitter @NewsRevoltRyan<|endoftext|>WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Bernie Sanders, another top contender for the Democratic nomination, said Wednesday that he has no intention of dropping out of the race. And he didn't say when exactly he'd do it.

The Vermont independent said he had no intention of doing so, with an emphatic ""No!"" when asked if he planned to join Hillary Clinton's campaign or drop out of the Democratic race.

The Vermont senator is the latest to say he'll not drop out amid a heavy polling deficit, particularly among superdelegates and those who may be motivated by a vote for a rival. Clinton has pledged she will finish first.

While Sanders told ABC's ""This Week"" that he isn't trying to be a spoiler and will seek all the delegates as soon as he becomes the Democratic nominee, he's facing a growing challenge to his standing with supporters. The presumptive Democratic nominee is polling higher among liberal-leaning voters in states like New York and California, the two states where her campaign is surging with huge crowds.

Clinton's lead in New York and California — the two most populous states that will likely decide the national nominating contest, each up 10 points in recent polls — has been shrinking.

Sanders' campaign has said that his numbers for Clinton have moved closer — as it has in earlier contests in those states — but both candidates, with the exception of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, have remained on the campaign trail.

With about 500 delegates at stake in next month's primary — and with more superdelegates in line before convention selection — Sanders must win all but 40 of those contests before reaching the 1,144 pledged delegates required to secure the Democratic nomination. It comes as Clinton continues to climb the list of contenders, raising her number of superdelegate endorsements as an outside contender with a wider margin than Sanders.

A win on Tuesday in Iowa would give her a big win in the contest, as her support grows among independents, and with the addition of new states like New York, she's closing the gap among men.

"SHARPTON SHAKES DOWN PASTORS FOR DONATIONS AT MEMORIAL FOR BLACK YOUTHS: Black Pastor Calls Sharpton A “Pimp” Hey Al Why don t you try going into the neighborhoods of Chicago and ask the residents to contribute to your worthless charity? Everyone knows Shakedown Al does nothing to help the hundreds of young black men who are killed by other black youths every year. It s all about  the same reasons: drugs, violence, gangs and poverty, and shakedown Al has been completely useless in either creating public awareness or addressing any of these issues. Instead, his own organization is just run because, well, that's all he cares. He wants to win. It s true, his own website, with this slogan ""No Shame, No Charity, No War"" has proven him wrong so far. It s like Al is a little kid who doesn 't really understand that people on the lowest rungs of society deserve what they have. He s been in the wrong business. But the answer would be simple.""

This is exactly the answer I am looking for. When I say NO shame, NO charity, AND no war I'm being brutally honest.


That was a very long answer. There will be more and more of this, I promise. It is hard to watch videos like this and not think about how many more of these will come out, and by the way, many people will be killed or maimed. People need to know where Al gets his money. He is an example why I have changed my vote from Republican to Democrat. I will never do it again unless Al comes out and says that he is not an extremist in the Muslim community, and he knows that my statement will not be a bluff. You just can't keep telling yourselves ""yeah, he can help us. he is an extremist, we need him and we're going to do everything in our power to get him prosecuted and get him off the streets of Chicago when the time comes, he is an extremist, we need help and we are prepared to act as if we have been there but we are too naive. Look at how angry and outraged people who are innocent of any crime have been after Al's actions. I hope my comment is correct and will help people understand my concern and if any of you are Muslim or a Christian believe in God, you will see in this video that you can trust Al to say if anyone is going to be shot for standing up for peace and justice in our country, it is going to be Al. He says he is a Christian but a Muslim and his actions speak volumes. We need to take action against him. If I can say that even after being made aware of Al's actions, he is still going to work on the streets of Chicago because he is a decent person and he is the best person who can fight against the violence. I know there are people in the Muslim community who",1
"WW3 Nuclear War Drills World War 3 To Start In Ukraine November 1, 2016 at 10:33 pm You never see these debates in Parliament on the BBC news not one bit. Just shows you all the bullshit that doesn't really have anything to do with the people of this country. They have no good intentions for our people and are only  interested in power and profit.

What will the UK Government do if this is confirmed that people have been dying in UK hospitals?

I have been told that many NHS institutions have a shortage of staff in their acute and specialty care areas. These days there are usually a few staff on call who can provide immediate, necessary healthcare services if anyone cannot be available. However these services do not include routine services such as oxygenation, bloodwork etc and many patients die without these.

The NHS in Scotland has a similar lack of capacity, which is why the SNP Government have promised to provide more capacity for those with an acute need.

So is the UK government going to use the ""death penalty"", should the trial go ahead?

I have been unable to find any information about a trial at the moment regarding a death penalty. I assume any trial would need to go through the justice system process, which would result in the use of a mandatory life term for a person charged with a capital offence. I have asked the Home Office if this would be possible with the current system. While there is the possibility that a mandatory life sentence for a person found guilty of grievous bodily harm would be established, there do not appear to be any legal grounds upon which a mandatory sentence can be applied.

Why does the UK government need to be taking over the NHS at this point?

If you want to make health care the right thing to do, then the NHS should remain part of the UK political, social and economic system that provides for us all. It is time that the government stopped making decisions based on party lines, that was what we were taught as children under Labour and it is time that the British people demand change.<|endoftext|>The US president has just announced that President Barack Obama – whose father was Kenyan-born Kenyan-American – is the first African leader to visit Australia.

The trip to Brisbane should see Mr Obama visit Australia's iconic beaches, visit Townsville and Adelaide, visit the Museum of Science and Industry, Sydney Opera House and visit the Australian National Theatre.

The prime minister has also announced his plans to visit Australia's Northern Territory and Tasmania – all territories along the Great Barrier Reef – and visit Australian beaches.

Obama's official schedule notes that the Obamas will also visit St Kilda, Sunshine Coast, Ballarat, Coffs Harbour, Tauranga, Darwin, Townsville and Port Douglas in New South Wales.

"COPYCAT MUSLIM TERRORIST ARRESTED With Assault Weapons, Knives Drives Into Busy Shopping Area At High Speed [VIDEO] Assimilation fail A French Muslim has been arrested after trying to drive a car loaded with liquid gas, assault rifles and knives into a crowd at high speed on a busy shopping street in Antwerp. Belgian police, who confirmed more security personnel had been sent to the area, said the  victim's brother died of his injuries. A French man and a Belgian Muslim are among the suspects in a Paris car attack that left 130 people injured Wednesday night before investigators recovered an explosive device filled with nails at the scene, officials said. The attack took place during a rush hour in the heavily-trafficked Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis, where police had blocked off traffic and arrested a 31-year-old man. Belgian President Charles Michel condemned the ""senseless and brutal act of terrorism,"" speaking to reporters after visiting the scene of the incident. He said his nation would ""work very with all the friends of our brother, and with all the allies and partners of the European Union,"" to protect France. He said all French soldiers would remain in their posts until the ""terrorist objective (in the attacks) is destroyed."" Michel also condemned a ""shameless"" attack that saw three attackers ""in addition to being armed, carrying Kalashnikov assault rifles, wearing gas masks,"" and ""having the means to carry out an attack in our national capital."" The victims include three French soldiers who died in a helicopter crash. A fourth person was hurt when his vehicle caught fire and was destroyed. According to France's Interior Ministry, the driver was identified as 33-year-old Salah Abdeslam. At least three police officers were injured in the attack that targeted Paris suburb Saint-Denis, Belgium's AP news agency reported, citing a police statement.

"YES! TRUMP’S UTAH AUDIENCE Chants ‘Four More Years!’ [Video] President Trump was in Utah today for the signing of a rollback on federal land overreach. He s basically giving land back to the states that Clinton and Obama took for the federal government.The local leaders have applauded this move by Trump but the environmentalists are freaking out:President Trump signed  his legislation to roll back the government's role in public lands and the destruction of the environment on National Monument lands. The president called the move ""unprecedented"" and promised the legislation would ""help rebuild our nation."" His announcement went viral on Twitter.This action was made by the president for conservation and to restore public lands and the environment:Some are outraged by Trump's action and say it's an effort to undermine national monuments across the country. Many conservation groups have said the president has the right to create these monuments without Congress having to approve this or another initiative to protect them.In Utah, Utah lawmakers took action during the 2017 legislative session to address the problems they identified with the federal land use strategy. The proposal included measures to ""increase public awareness regarding restoration and management of public lands.""It has recently been suggested in the media that the decision had everything to do with the president signing his legislation.""When they went to town halls of the state's legislators, all of them expressed deep concerns about the direction of public lands management,"" said Ryan Taylor with the Bureau of Land Management.Taylor said lawmakers felt federal lands managed by the BLM had become too much of a focus for local management. The BLM announced on Monday it plans to make changes to how to manage the public lands in Utah.""Our efforts are meant to ensure federal lands can remain in good condition for recreational and conservation use, while preserving them for our communities,"" said the BLM in a written statement after announcing the decision.The Utah House passed HB 946 last month, and the Senate will next see action with approval of an identical bill in the end of June.Utah is one of a few places where Trump can't get his way.

"WOW! ANOTHER YOUNG MAN Found DEAD After Serving DNC With Papers In Fraud Suit On Behalf Of Bernie Sanders [VIDEO] That s the third suspicious death of a man tied in some way to Hillary. Does anyone in law enforcement have an accurate body count of suspicious deaths tied to Hillary? We recently questioned the suspicious murder of 27 year old Democrat Data Director Seth Rich, as he was walking  out of a Rich family fund-raiser, which happened just hours before Donald Trump's inauguration – and not only did Hillary Clinton end up being Hillary but so did her campaign. The Rich case was investigated for months by the Washington Free Beacon and other media who knew everything about the case, but there was no evidence tying Hillary to this case. That is what makes Seth Rich so important for everyone to look at. There are so many suspicious deaths tied to Hillary there's no way to track them all down.

The reason they don't want anyone to know the facts was just so the Hillary's could bury the lead completely. If the truth could be learned the entire thing would finally end – except for possibly Hillary's friends and advisors. Why would they do this to an innocent man?<|endoftext|>In 2015, a little-known law changed things for the health care industry and many Americans.

It requires health companies, hospitals, doctors, dentists, drug firms and others to disclose in a way that's as accurate as possible whether or not their products cause chronic conditions like Alzheimer's, heart disease or multiple sclerosis.

But the law's biggest impact has been on doctors, with the numbers of patients getting treatment for such diseases rising rapidly in recent years.

This year, it's estimated that the federal government helped pay for almost half of all treatments for chronic conditions paid for by the government in the first half of 2015. It's nearly $2 billion in Medicaid payments, but only $150 million in Medicare reimbursements, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

And that's before you take into account how much time patients spend in the hospital and after.

And it's far less costly when patients seek care in a hospital than when they visit someone who has no doctors, or an extended-care provider — the doctor for whom they're choosing. ""A large group of people don't have doctors or hospitals because there aren't many alternatives,"" said Brian Dube, chief physician for the medical center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan and the nation's leading expert in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, one of the leading chronic inflammatory conditions.

As long as a patient can maintain a steady blood pressure and oxygen saturation at a stable range of temperatures when they get to a primary care facility, they're not out of luck.

That helps lower costs for a variety of factors — insurance premiums, for a health professional, and in-patient and doctor services — the",1
"Hillary Clinton: ‘Israel First’ (and no peace for Middle East) Robert Fantina CounterpunchAlthough the United States is still ten months from its next exercise in electoral futility, most polls do not indicate what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is most anxious to see: a runaway victory for her candidacy. It is a good sign that, despite the fact that  the campaign has been a dismal failure, the Democratic establishment is not going to change its methods to make a comeback, as happened in 2010 when President Obama won re-election by about 20 points.

To begin with, President Obama will be able to campaign like no other president in history: he is well accustomed to running on the slogan ""Dreams from my Father,"" and if the Democrats win enough blue states, he will no longer have to resort to the more conventional strategies that Republicans have employed for decades. The American voter is not going to want to hear the phrase ""middle class,"" because he or she sees all of it in the words of Donald Trump. If Republicans win in red states, as the polling is indicating, that will put Hillary Clinton's ""middle class"" claim to the test. It will not take long before the Clinton camp, which is trying to use the specter of third party voters as a weapon against the Democratic incumbent, finds itself under siege. There are few doubts about how serious she is about winning the white working class voters that she needs, and that is why she will not let her campaign get blown up by an attempt by the President of the United States to win just one more state.

At the moment, even some Obama supporters in states like Illinois are worried that he will simply do whatever he wants, and, even if Obama had the upper hand in Illinois, many in the state are not convinced that he will be able to win even after some of the recent gains. According to a poll conducted earlier this month by the Chicago Tribune, more than half of Illinoisans would vote in 2016 for the first time if Hillary Clinton were still running against Donald Trump. Even if her candidacy would have an upper hand in Michigan, the numbers are even more negative: nearly six in 10 voters there would not vote for her.

What is going to be the reaction of the Democrats to a win by President Obama? Most experts think that the Democrats would be unable to rally support from the large minority of voters that supported Sanders. Hillary's campaign appears to be preparing for a successful assault on Trump, but it should not fool anyone. The Sanders campaign and the Clinton campaign must take note that, despite their similarities in many ways, Obama has already lost both the primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire. The American public has rejected Hillary Clinton for more than a decade and they will reject her for years to come. As long as the Democratic Party is stuck between two disastrous candidates, there will be little chance for the Party to",1
"Paul Ryan: He's the Fiscal Policy Illiterate in the Conggress License DMCA Ryan, Obama, McConnell, Reid, Pelosi, MSM, and most of Americans need to grasp and act on the irrefutable fact that America can never, involuntarily, go broke. We can afford anything we need which serves a public purpose. All of our needs are paid for from the Treasury's General  Fund. We are not insolvent, and will never be. The debt has been cut in half, and it will get better, faster, if more Americans were willing to sacrifice for it. I do not have the authority to tell others to go and work for me. I do not need their labor power, and I do not need their financial capital. I would never give up my house, car, savings or their children for a chance to earn a living. It is not about taking a loan to buy an ATM, or buying a house, or for a child to go to college; it is about creating jobs, making the American Dream a reality for all of us, including the poor, and ensuring our children the most prosperous, happiest lives possible. I will stand by any deal we reach to get this debt off the backs of Americans. We can agree to put America back in the hands of its citizens. We can agree to work with each other to fix the system that has allowed us to be the No. 1 debtor in the world. We need to stop calling each other in the middle of the night on a Saturday morning to ask for something to make the holidays sweeter. Every year, millions of Americans find themselves in financial difficulty because of an economic downturn. The Federal Reserve system was created to preserve monetary stability for all Americans. It was not created to provide a subsidy to the wealthy. It was never intended to support high-interest, junk mortgages that are the main cause of the current crisis. And yet, this failure by both the Federal Reserve and the public to fully understand the cause of the current crisis, to put an end to those incentives, is what created the present predicament of American households, businesses, and workers in terms of their ability to make ends meet. We need to stop letting it get to us. We cannot continue to rely on gimmicks, special deals or the magic phrase that magically solves all problems within a month. We need to come together and face the realities of what it takes to survive in this harsh and volatile economy. We must start by accepting we no longer have the luxury of living in an economy where we can easily afford a house, car, a carpenter's workshop, a lawyer's salary, a computer-generated paycheck, or even a roof over our head. We need to stop playing by those gimmicks, special deals and promises that allow the wealthiest Americans to earn a great deal while millions of our fellow citizens struggle. We need to learn the lesson of the last year, and start",1
" WATCH: Joy Reid HAMMERS Republicans For Wasting Taxpayer Money To Pay For Trump’s Wall Republicans are lying when they claim to be fiscally conservative, and Donald Trump s wall proves it.Throughout the campaign, the central promise Trump made to his supporters was that he would build a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and force Mexico to pay for it.And then one day during  the campaign, Trump announced his plan to get Mexico to pay for it. His plan included bringing all those illegal migrants who hadn't yet arrived on U.S.-Mexico borders back to the U.S. with promises of a better life to give them a better deal.Trump promised Mexicans that he's ""bringing back millions of people"" from El Salvador, a country whose government will have to pay for the massive wall to be built.Trump never had to actually make a concrete promise to anyone. But this does show why the Wall was put in place. The reality of the plan was that he said that the wall would bring millions of people out of the shadows, that would create jobs, and would make the middle class grow.But we had another problem waiting for us too. The U.S. had been paying $18 billion in reparations for slavery to the United States since 1776. The United States had already paid $5 billion. So Trump was saying to the Mexican taxpayers, pay up and let us work out a better deal for you?Well, if there is one positive Trump has to take from this moment, it should be that Americans of all kinds should be aware that it's possible to talk about trade and immigration while also doing something good for the poor and vulnerable populations of Africa and South Asia. It should be equally obvious that there are powerful forces fighting to keep the North from achieving self-determination.It's worth noting that after the Wall came down, the U.S. passed the World Trade Organization. If the TPP was any good, it would give African countries the leverage they need in order to ensure that their citizens will not be trapped in North Korea while the South gets everything it wants.So even as Trump is promising to build a massive wall on the border, we saw the Obama administrations spend $2 billion funding the Obama Foundation. That's a lot of money spent when we do our best to create jobs in developing countries, but it's only a quarter of what the U.S. spent the last 14 years to fund the foundation.If the U.S. were to do the same thing to help out the poor and disadvantaged in Africa and South Asia, we would soon see an uproar and accusations that we are doing too little for the poor and the vulnerable. Instead, we have Trump saying that the U.S. should invest heavily in education and health and education, and if he's not willing to pay for that, then we should not invest heavily in this area as well.

"Russian Economy Minister Arrested For $2 Million Bribe Over Rosneft Deal - Russia News Now This post was originally published on this site Update: RUSSIAN PM APPOINTS DEPUTY MINISTER YELIN AS ACTING RUSSIAN ECONOMY MINISTER – IFAX * * * In an unexpected move, Russian Economy Minister Alexey Ulyukayev was detained Monday on suspicion of taking a $2 million bribe in return for his ministry’s  decision to approve a $70 billion deal to ship Russian energy oil to Europe from Iranian ports. In return Ulyukayev was to make it easier for Russian oil companies to sell fuel to the European market. The oil would have helped to prop up the ruble against the dollar. The oil deal was worth $17.50 per barrel but, after Ulyukayev, the ruble fell to as low as 2.1% a few days later. The deal was to be signed over the weekend. In turn Ukraine, a former Soviet republic with a $5 trillion economy and which signed a trade agreement in March, was to receive $100 million in trade finance from Kazakhstan. * * * Ulyukayev, 46, reportedly gave an $8,000 check to a person in his office demanding $100 million. If proven, this is quite a sizable price for what Russia wants for its oil and gas exports to Europe’ and possibly in exchange for Ukraine not joining NATO or taking part in any sort of sanctions against Russia. * * * In addition, Russia received $2.2 billion in foreign exchange from Ukraine in the first half of this year. But as The Washington Post notes, ""Ukraine's decision to approve a $30 billion oil-dumping deal with Iran was in some ways less about securing Ukraine's interests, and more about making a political statement to the West about Russia‖"" That Russia wants to benefit from Ukraine's relationship with the West and Russia not taking sides in Ukraine's political life is hardly surprising given their mutual desire to undermine the West‖but the $5 billion gas price deal has drawn more attention. To recap, the $70 billion has to come out of Putin's pocket and not from Ukraine‖however the two countries are at odds on various questions, including the matter of Crimea‖and there has been discussion since the spring about how Ukraine should use the $70 billion to help its economy‖but in the end, Ukraine was not given what it thought was its due share at the last minute, apparently in violation of trade deals signed by both countries. * * * Russian economy minister approved $70 billion oil transaction between Iran and Russia that will benefit European market as $50M worth more exports than before * * * After years of conflict in Ukraine and now Crimea, Russia is hoping to get its oil out of Ukraine and sell it to Europe once again. But it's unclear whether President Vladimir Putin should allow this to happen with U.S. President",1
" WATCH: Video Shows Baton Rouge Cops Repeatedly Shooting A Black Man Point Blank In The Chest Shortly after midnight Tuesday morning, 37-year-old Alton Sterling was standing outside a Triple S Food Mart in Baton Rouge selling music CDs when the police responded to a call that he had threatened someone with a gun. The police have yet to say if a gun was found at the  scene but a witness told WBRZ that he saw an officer grab Sterling's sweatshirt and toss it in the air, as though it were evidence. The officer then shot and killed Sterling.

That person, an employee at the store, has not yet been identified. The store, located on East 14th Street, has been closed since the incident.

UPDATE: The Baton Rouge Police Department released this statement Sunday night:

Two persons have been arrested for the shooting incident. One of the individuals is a person of interest in this investigation.

The Stop Online Piracy Act was designed to protect children from content that is illegal and harmful to their learning, and the bill would have allowed Internet intermediaries to block sites that didn't abide by the terms of service, and other services. But instead, the House failed to put the House on record, and sent it to the Senate where it died.

When we began our push to shut down the Internet, we set out to make sure that the American people heard loud and clear from their elected officials what was in the best interest of their children. Our message to members of Congress was plain: shut it down. And they responded, sending this message back. Because today, the House of Representatives voted to silence the Internet, and the Internet continues to flourish. This legislation would have given the executive, not Congress, the power to take down websites, censor videos, blacklist websites and online services, and censor the websites that supported the Internet in the first place.

I'm the daughter of a man who worked on an ISP – one of the leading internet service providers now is Comcast, one of the leading internet service providers in the United States. What we call ISPs are some of the biggest names in the telecommunications industry. They build their businesses by giving out Internet access. They serve over 80 percent of U.S. homes that are not in a home with a telephone connection. When you use the internet, you interact with content on a vast array of websites, and you receive emails with thousands of other people from these websites from other countries around the world.

When the federal government passes regulations to regulate the internet, it must take into account all of these things and make sure they are designed with the best interests of kids in mind",1
" Elizabeth Warren Has Found BREATHTAKING Hypocrisy In FBI’s Treatment Of Hillary’s Emails Buckle up. Elizabeth Warren, continuing her crusade for the little guy, wrote a letter to FBI director James Comey over their transparency with Hillary s emails, because they didn t have that same transparency when investigating the big banks. In fact, they usually don t release anything when there s  any kind of criminal investigation going on, other than to announce t hanks they would look into. It only makes sense in hindsight.

The Commission found that the company released a film in which Weinstein claimed that they used a child as their prop in a promotional scene during the movie 'In the Heat of the Night' but had to go after it because they could not keep their promise. A number of women made allegations that this was in breach of the Sexual Offences Act 2010 when the film allegedly had an all male casting department, leading to another investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority.

On Wednesday, the ABC revealed that the Australian Independent Media Commission has opened a formal enquiry into claims of sexual assault for an investigation which the ABC says will begin in June. In a letter to Ms Giggles in this week s o nd, the Department of Health said that they would assist with bringing charges against Weinstein, although it did not give any details on how to proceed. The commission sent ""deep concern and concern"" at the way in which the allegations were made in the letter, especially over allegations about ""the ability of women to be adequately cross-examined and questioned about their credibility in these matters.""

""At the centre of this inquiry will be the allegation made that Harvey Weinstein inappropriately touched or behaved inappropriately towards women, particularly when such complaints are made by women who have worked as props in the films he produced,"" the letter says.

In response to the letter the department said that it's ""committed to ensuring this kind of behaviour never happens in",1
"Michael Moore Visits WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange [Video] Leave a reply Bill Still – Michael Moore went to London to visit with Julian Assange. After he came out, he turned a camera on himself and gave us a little first-person report on his visit. Although the lack of detail makes you want to scream for more, what we  learned is that Michael was working on a docu-series called Julian Assange: The Man. We can't confirm whether he went up to the Ecuadorian Embassy, but his visit was quite successful and he stayed for several days and has returned to London. Michael told the crowd, which included journalists from The Guardian and the Financial Times, that he got more than he bargained for when Assange was accused of breaching Ecuador's diplomatic immunity. That sounds like bullshit. After all, the British government (and British citizens) can't be trusted with national secrets. It's laughable that Michael Moore thinks he deserves to have his country and people thrown in jail for refusing to give him access.

A spokesman for Mr Flynn said the 30-year-old was under 'intense questioning,' but stressed he had told the truth during the conversation with the Russian ambassador. He said Mr Flynn was acting on his client's initiative and asked him not to come up to the meeting. 'From the start, it looked like his client was seeking some form of political or other relationship with Mr Putin, and that is what he was after. He wasn't seeking to gain any benefits directly from his client, but rather, was pursuing some kind of political or other relationship,' said spokesman Michael Anton.

" This University Will Punish You For Being Raped, Effectively Silencing Victims Imagine being a woman going to a university where instead of only investigating the person who sexually assaulted you, they also choose to discipline you as well. That s exactly what s happening to young women who attend Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.BYU prides itself on Mormon values, yet  one of the ways these values are being violated is through mandatory Title IX inquiries. For instance, BYU students report that some women are being harassed over the university sexual assault reporting process. The Provo Police Department is responsible for these complaints through sexual assault investigations, and if the school was truly committed to investigating these incidents, that means it should be actively investigating these complaints, not a small school campus like BYU.""Sexual assault is real,"" says BYU spokesman Sean Tashich. ""We understand it should be addressed, and we do understand that it happened to one young women who reported an assault. To suggest otherwise is not only incorrect and offensive, it is dangerous and disrespectful. If BYU continues to take this in stride, we expect other schools to do the same.""Since 2008, the university has hired a team of experienced investigators, but as Tashich acknowledges, it still takes time before they're satisfied and their investigations are completed. ""But, they're doing more to deal with them now,"" he says. ""And when they see that that's happening, they're making sure to make sure there's consequences.""What's really concerning in this situation is that university officials refuse to answer the basic questions posed by students who report such incidents to them. These questions include why a young women was targeted, what happened that night and whether the woman knew the perpetrator. Students who report incidents or complaints of this kind aren't being treated just like any other student; rather, they are being charged with a sex crimes crime.It does seem like BYU is ignoring the legitimate concerns raised by rape survivors and the women who suffer and can't speak out against the university sexual assaults. However, while Tashich would like to hear a different message from the Provo Police Department, I'm sure that the school has heard from its top officials that they can't just ignore students. I'm sure that the Provo Police Department would prefer to protect their investigation.<|endoftext|>The official White House website and mobile app are reporting Wednesday's shooting at an evening concert by the ""Fame Killers,"" an Atlanta-based rap group led by the vocalist Macklemore and the rapper Killer Mike.

" Can’t Afford Clean Water For Flint, But Israel Demands $50 Billion From U.S. Taxpayers (VIDEO) In a showdown with the U.S. government, Israel is demanding that its current aid package be drastically increased by an enormous margin. With the current aid agreement of $30 billion over ten years set to expire in 2017, Israel now wants that increased to $50 billion over the next ten  years and possibly even more in 2020. Israel's demand is that every Palestinian living in Gaza must leave by the end of 2022 or its own death will be decided.

While Israel's demands are harsh, they are not unusual. There is a history of demands like this coming from Israel, and yet they still receive no response from the Obama administration and are ignored. It is almost as if the U.S. State Department (now led by Secretary of State John Kerry) and the Palestinian Authority were in some kind of alliance, the Palestinians were forced to surrender their territorial demands while Israel negotiated with them for their surrender.

It should be noted that at the time, the Obama administration did not realize Palestine was such an important issue that it should have been given greater attention. Many U.S. officials wanted a quick resolution of the dispute in Gaza, but what many didn't realize was that many of those issues would come about due to economic and political considerations and the fact that Hamas had already lost many of its key people.

With the current demand being so out of step with what other U.S. states should be doing in terms of helping the Palestinians, I will be the first to admit to having been wrong on Gaza as far as Obama is concerned. I have no doubt that Obama will continue to push for a resolution, but as to whether Gaza will get its way, I do not know. For years, people were willing to overlook how Hamas had been taking more land from the Palestinians, and so this will remain.

The other major reason why the U.S. continues to do little in terms of helping the Palestinians is because, like many of my fellow progressives, I believe Israel should play by the rules. Many in Israel are frustrated at the level of corruption and corruption of officials of various governments that are now going on in Israel and not just in a minority Jewish country.

It is no exaggeration to say there is corruption in Israeli politics. The corruption is all over the place and it does not stop with Netanyahu but goes from the top down in Israel. To say that corruption is bad in Israel is to say something wrong. Even as the Israeli government, led by Netanyahu, continues to ignore Israel's civil and human rights violations in the Palestinian territories, Israel's economy goes from doing very well to doing extremely poorly.

Israel's treatment of its Palestinians has been on the rise every day for a long time in terms of oppression of Palestinians and their rights. When I say treatment, I am speaking",1

The study, published online today in the International Journal of Obesity, included 10,913 adults from the largest health-care association in the world. The average age in the study was 60.5, and 40 percent were overweight or obese.

Overall, 10 to 28 percent of participants did not exercise more than 30 minutes every week; 7 percent engaged in less than 5 minutes of moderate exertion, 6 percent engaged in less than 1 minute of vigorous exertion and 23 percent engaged in less than 5 minutes of vigorous activity on at least 4 days per week.

This is largely due to the lack of physical activity that many people in Russia experience, said study co-author Dr. Anja Krause, a senior scientist with Janssen Health Services, in an interview with NPR. Many adults in the study do not eat healthy foods with added fats in them.

The researchers found the association between low physical activity and higher weight increased with each additional hour of sleep a day. This is likely due to the amount of sunlight that's absorbed by the skin, Krause said.

" Case Regarding Cruz’s Birthright Citizenship Reaches Supreme Court One of the biggest mysteries in Constitutional Law is what the Framers meant when they said natural born citizen. Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution states the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the United States, and under clause 5 one would find the natural  born citizen clause mentioned in the amendment: ""No foreign head of state, with intent to undermine the public safety . . . or to impair the obligation . . . of the United States . . . shall become President of the United States."" 1 While these questions still are not answered by the legislative branch even though the U.S. Constitution is a testament to ""freedom of the people from tyranny"" and was specifically intended to limit its power, it's not unheard of for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide cases in the political arena related with the Constitution while considering the natural born citizenship clause.

The Second Amendment, which states that the militia is to be trained and led by an ""appointed"" commander, was approved by the state legislatures of Illinois and Kansas during the 1860-1865 presidential election. According to the court's ruling, the legislature of Illinois, which also passed a law declaring that ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . . . , shall be subject to the limitations of the Constitution."" 2 In November of 1865, the Illinois legislature passed an amendment stating that ""the right of the people . . . to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed in the State of Illinois or any other State in the United States except in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion."" 3 It seems that the Illinois legislature was also in agreement with several of the other members (both Democratic, and Republican) of the legislature who supported state militias, and not wanting the military takeover of the state's public safety function. The Republican governor of Illinois, William L. McHenry, believed the militia to be inadequate in protecting the citizens, and that the citizenry would be too weak to protect itself. 4

The Supreme Court held in United States v. Nixon, that the government was not barred from placing a national security interest above that of the individual's right to own firearms. 5 One of the great issues the court dealt with in this case was whether the government had a legitimate interest in making citizens in the area of the U.S. armed forces as well as their dependents a higher priority than that of those in the local areas. The government, which had already made clear what that interest was, tried to deny any interest, even if the state government did indeed have one, that the citizenry of Chicago did not share. This issue, that citizens would not support the United States government's efforts to control local police forces, is the same issue that led to the constitutional amendment allowing",1
"BBC: Nato sends a message to Russia link The simple fact is that this is not a Cold War Mark II - far from it. Russia with its declining economy is nothing like the Soviet Union, which aspired to establish a different world order to that pursued by the capitalist West. Russia is in many ways a  more advanced democracy - more advanced because it is in more competition with the West. Unlike the West, Russia cannot hope to maintain its influence by dominating all nations. While the ruling coalition is much stronger than the U.S., there are many reasons for this - a strong economy, a stable political system, a rich and important Russian cultural scene, a close military alliance and the strong economic ties with Russia and other former Communist countries. This article is merely a statement of fact - what is likely to happen with Russia's relations with the West will not be a 'Cold War' Mark I or II. The U.S. is the largest importer of Russian weapons, but Russia also has its own nuclear program and a vast stockpile of conventional weapons such as missiles, artillery, aircraft, artillery weapons and tanks. Since the crisis broke out in 1999, Russia has been actively buying U.S. weaponry, including missiles, from the American military and U.S. intelligence agencies. All of this has had an influence, or influence, on Russian relations. There can be no doubt about it: despite Russia's recent weakness vis-à-vis the West, Russia is much more powerful and powerful now. But is this because we are closer to the West, or because we are less dependent on U.S. military assistance? No - this is because the West is so large and more influential against Russia - but at a crucial moment in its history it is at home, and it needs to be aware of Russia's growing importance to its own interests. This will happen if and when they become aware of Russia's growing weakness. In the meantime it will simply continue taking advantage of it - at least until Russia decides to start making real changes. Russia is not on an equal footing with the East; it is a smaller entity and has far less influence - but it could make a considerable difference to its position and influence and we should pay a lot more attention to that. The West today, while less powerful and much more influential, has a much stronger military and diplomatic presence in the world and does more to support and empower the rest of the free world. Even if the U.S., France, Russia, Britain, Israel and Australia do not like it, it does not deny that Europe has problems and is more vulnerable. The European continent, which is in a deep recession with high unemployment, has a history of civil wars within it and no country will ever be ruled by one party.

"LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD IMPLODES! Ratings Are In For The Trump-Bashing Emmys…Insignificant Celebrities Are Dealt MAJOR BLOW! This summer s box office numbers were the worst they ve been in over 25 years, and now this KNOCK, KNOCK! Who s there? Karma Adjustments might take a little of the sting out of the news that Sunday night s Emmy telecast was a ratings catastrophe, but any adjustment  in that regard, or in the ratings at all, is going to be hard-won. The new ratings and the new cast are not a substitute for the real thing, and they are certainly not going to turn out to be a silver lining in an otherwise unimpressive month of television. And they can't change the entire course of television's destiny without the audience and the TV production. What is to stop producers, who can't decide how to produce on their own, from producing, say, a TV version of some movie that will be a little more expensive later because it had an audience, from pulling the plug on the very best-looking and best-acted drama on television when that movie has already been in production for a while, or if we can actually find that actor who will go on to have a significant role in the next great drama show that turns out not to be happening? And at this point, the network is in an extremely difficult position to figure out how to balance all of these elements without having the worst month since '70 of it all. It is difficult. I love the show I do on it. I love that I think there might be someone out there who might be able — maybe it was an over-reaction on my part, not on the part of HBO — to make a dramatic change and turn it around before people start to worry that there might be an audience.

And I am glad that at some point in season seven we begin the real process of how we're going to work together to decide what has become an extraordinarily difficult problem to solve. And I am glad that there are things that would help all those producers — myself included — to feel better about themselves and their choices and choices of other people to do it for them, rather than being stuck in a maddening process with people who are too busy worrying about trying not to be caught up in the drama they just might be a part of.

" Hillary BLASTS Anti-Woman, Anti-Immigrant Republicans In Glorious #GOPDebate Live Tweets Thursday night marked the seventh GOP debate of this presidential election season. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton decided to take the opportunity to remind us all just what a GOP win in 2016 would mean for the country. She took to her twitter account to make sure everyone knew not to  forget that we aren't just going about our lives as if we're stuck in a cave. Clinton reminded us there are jobs across the country, she knows what's going on in our schools and colleges and she will fight for your right to education.

We have been hearing a lot about this for some time now, including from various other newspapers and news websites here at the Intercept.

While we can understand the UK government's interest in this investigation, how likely is it that the ""collateral damage"" involved here (that has not yet been confirmed to the press) would be any harm? That has very little to do with just how many thousands of people have been killed, wounded, tortured, imprisoned, and otherwise inconvenienced by US-led forces overseas; instead, this issue centers around how people who engage in direct action get a good deal that would put them into the middle of a legal battle that could cost them everything they",1
"Comment on ‘I won’t stop until I’m too fat to move’: Morbidly obese model who dreams of weighing 1000lbs by welcometoskaamoog Posted on September 7, 2016 by DCG | 53 Comments Liberals would probably tell you to not “body shame” her. I say this woman needs serious medical and mental treatment. From Daily Mail : An obese model who is paid by men to eat wants to pile on a further  £800 to see her doctor after having a massive belly. I have to say this one needs to be put on hold until she has had a belly massage and then is fit and healthy for work. The problem is that women aren't fit enough for that sort of bodybuilding.

Posted on September 9, 2016 by DCG | 1 Comment Just to be clear, we're all just talking about overweight women. We're not saying fat women are ugly. If they are ugly then the problem with them is not that they have fat but that they are fat for less money. But yes, a lot of women are unhappy about things like having long tummies, huge thighs or breasts. People get sick if they're put on food that doesn't suit them.

Posted on September 10, 2016 by DCG | 1 Comment The point I am trying to make in these comments is that we live in a culture where eating disorders are treated with a lot of hostility by media, law enforcement, politicians, media outlets, the media. People get fat, don't get fat, get thin, eat like everybody else and never feel like you're wasting your life, because that is considered normal. This creates a toxic environment for everyone. We need a world where the healthy-ness of this society is respected, and the unhealthy-ness of this society is understood. If a person finds themselves obese or at risk for obesity, they should get help from a professional professional who can help them.

The book is a brilliant attempt by the author to show why Feynman is as relevant today as he was 30 years ago. The book offers a good history and some good definitions of Feynman's ideas as they were at their peak. However, the greatest gift of the book is that it offers a history of Feynman in full color. In addition to the title, the book has many excellent features, including the following:

The famous equations are in crisp, high definition, and accessible color in English, Russian, and German.

The book includes the original equations, and diagrams from various textbooks",1
"POWERFUL! FORMERLY OPPRESSED EX- MUSLIM WARNS Ignorant Americans About Danger Of “Welcoming The People I Fled From” [VIDEO] A former Muslim and Donald Trump supporter who fled Islam-controlled Kuwait years ago has a warning for Americans this election cycle.Sarah, an ex-Muslim who bravely denounced Islam at a Milo Yiannopoulos speech, said she would absolutely hate it if America started to embrace Islamic culture, the exact culture which led  to the burning of the 9/11 Islamic towers over a quarter century ago.

She added she was confident that no Muslim would ever feel the same way.

'This was a terrorist attack, there is no question about it. It was a murder of the free, diverse, multicultural world we live in. All you have to do is listen to what Donald Trump has been saying,' she told NBC reporter Will Tracy on Thursday. 'If I was going to vote for someone I wouldn't want them in power. I'm tired of all of this. It's a very scary time for America, but not because there are new radicals or jihadists or terrorists going around or anything like that.'

She said she was more worried about Donald Trump.

'I think Trump is crazy. You know, you know things like that. Not him, he's just crazy. Donald Trump is the last hope,' she said.

Sarah says she had been living under a false sense of security. When she returned to the small West Texas town where she was raised, she found Muslim men who were hostile because she would go to Islamic schools.

'My sense of security was shattered, it made me very afraid, so I couldn't be that open about it,' she said.

Despite what most would see as the overwhelming support for the Republican candidate, Sarah said she felt like her faith was being put through the ringer.

'I think it was all a facade.

'It was all about who is winning the political contest.'

After her trip to Saudi Arabia in 2006 she converted, marrying Mohammed, then 14, in 2004 and moved out three years later with their two children.

During a visit to the village of Kajar in 2011 she said a small group of Saudi women and young girls were seen in the local mosque singing Islamic songs.

But, despite claiming the men were 'really nice' the incident never came out publicly.

'This was my way of protesting the violence, not about Islam per se, but the kind of Islam that they're practising,' she said. 'It wasn't that there was a problem, they were just showing off the religion and I'm not going to judge people.'

After this visit, she said she decided to move home again.

She said she did this because she was so afraid of going to the mosque.

'My only fear at the time I left that school school was that",1

As this fall's budget negotiations get under way, the administration is insisting on an annual appropriation of roughly $600 billion, a large increase over last year. That's about 40 percent of the annual spending growth over the past decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

What's changed since 2010? The answer is a combination of changes that economists have long predicted are going to affect the budget. And what's changed since 2010? The answer is a combination of changes that economists have long predicted are going to affect the budget.

We started with this chart. You can sort the table by the amount of the difference between what's predicted by the CBO for the federal budget and what Congress received in this year's budget:

Some of the more striking changes in the chart -- the amount of cuts and the number of programs that have been eliminated or slowed for the first time since before the recession -- have little relationship to actual spending: they do appear to be affecting actual federal spending, but only a little.

This chart shows what the spending of the entire federal government would have been in 2010 if the proposed budget had passed. On the long list of cuts -- programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- we see that a few have fallen to the ground: a lot of those have been canceled, mostly by the Obama administration or the sequester.

Other programs that are still on the deficit, like food stamps, that may be a big improvement have been cut back. Some, like welfare, would have been added to the budget without raising the outlays, if they had existed at all under Obama, or would have had to be cut significantly.

" How Fox News Is Trying To Cover Up Its Harassment Lawsuit Lawyers working on behalf of Roger Ailes, the chairman of the right-wing Fox News Channel, filed a legal motion on Friday that would hide the details of former anchor Gretchen Carlson s sexual harassment allegations from the public.Ailes lawyers have asked that the lawsuit be moved from federal courts in  Alexandria to Florida, where they hope Carlson can settle her lawsuit with a new employer that takes her claims against the network more seriously, said David Einhorn, an attorney for Ailes and Carlson's attorney, Michael Clement. They filed their motion on Friday as Carlson's case continued to be investigated by the FBI and the Office of Special Counsel.It comes as Fox News's ratings drop. After losing about 12 million viewers the week after its election, the network's prime-time ratings for that week were up 6 percent over Monday and 14 percent over February. It's the second-worst week for the network this year after its election night coverage of the death of former Democratic Rep. Gabby Gifford in an FBI interview.The sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Carlson and a group of other women against Fox News centers on how anchor Gretchen Carlson approached sexual harassment allegations leveled by former employee Andrea Constand, who said she was fired following a complaint from a Fox News colleague.

The $7.8 million investment was supposed to be covered by the state and federal governments and the Energy Security Plan.

The plan requires that one-third of the facility's 50-percent-nuclear power capacity remain unfunded for four years, but after spending up to $8.4 million, the state Legislature said Tuesday the federal government will be on the hook for $7 million to build, maintain and operate the plant for the next 14 years.

And now to find an affordable solution. That came with the announcement from North Carolina Utilities and Regulatory Commission that it was closing in on the $8.4 million it sought for new generators to replace the aging reactor turbines and two large steam generators. The commission said it would have been possible to fund part of Moniz's costs if the energy security plan had included the cost of the retirement of the two small steam generators – now owned by the state.

A spokeswoman for the federal government, which pays the other half for keeping the plant running at Moniz, declined comment on the financial terms involved, saying",1
"SHOCKING REPORT: 50% of Babies in 24 States Born via Medicaid…Is Your State on the List? New Mexico led all states with 72 percent of the babies born there in 2015 having their births covered by Medicaid.Arkansas ranked second with 67 percent; Louisiana ranked third with 65 percent; and three states Mississippi, Nevada and Wisconsin tied for fourth place with 64 percent of babies born there  covered by Medicaid.Mississippi, Nevada and Wisconsin also rank among the bottom five states in Medicaid spending.For each of the four state with the lowest spending, Medicaid spending is more than five times greater than other top 50 states (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Maryland, Oklahoma and Texas).The cost to cover those costs can add up fast for families with children living in states at or below 50 percent. The uninsured accounted for 32 percent of all births in 2015, making Arkansas, Utah and California among the lowest five states with the lowest uninsured share.In addition to the high costs of Medicaid, low-income families face a severe financial burden for many reasons. For these families, the number of medical expenses is higher because they can't afford to obtain the care they need and are therefore less likely to find a provider who can offer the services they need. Low-income, working families who cannot afford private health insurance also pay outstate rates for health care and out-of-pocket costs.In addition, they must choose between working two jobs or getting poor care at home as well as getting a state health insurance plan. The uninsured also face more barriers to getting proper care from specialists in these states because of the large number of hospitalizations for conditions not covered under Medicaid.As of last year, the uninsured rate in five states accounted for 28 percent of births in 2017; Alaska, California, Maine, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont.<|endoftext|>As a member of the public, you're not always the first one to respond to an issue on your behalf.

If you are a science fiction fan and would like to learn other games that deal in some form of science, but it's hard to learn them because of lack of resources to get started, the Tic Tac toe series is a great place to start. Many new school kids are unfamiliar with the mechanics of playing Tic-Tac-Toe so for this first series, we decided to teach them how to play Tic-Tac-Toe, using science concepts rather than just a game of guessing about what colors will fall off a board. This series has a very specific rule set, a game that has been proven accurate on both sides and has been proven useful with a young child. (It is fun to watch how kids learn their rules.) So please keep in mind that playing any of these games for pleasure is fine, but if you do it for educational purpose, please let us know.


If you need to make an extra trip to the library to read the cards, click here.

If you are reading this on Kindle, you can get a discount on $0.99.

The term 'pseudo-intellectual' is of course not intended specifically to denigrate anyone whose opinion is not as a whole endorsed by mainstream scientific research.[1] In fact, the claim on several media accounts is that the term isn't meant to at all be disparaging.[2] In fact the opposite often happens:[3] A pseudo-intellectual is a person whose idea of an idea falls outside the typical academic paradigm, or who in any way represents an outside fringe of that idea or of the mainstream intellectual tradition.

In science, this can be in one of several ways. A pseudo-intellectual might have some background in a particular field, but is too specialized or specialized to really be considered an alternative scientific voice in any meaningful way. That is, a pseudo-intellectual, while no longer technically associated with the academy, is also no more credible than a physicist, chemist or neuroscientist. A pseudo-intellectual who has the same background will, in some way, share the common goal for intellectual freedom as any other group is being allowed to.

In fact, I would make and then sell them at parties, and in return, I would get free art.

I took this idea and added a few other factors to it.

First, I bought a ""Magic: The Gathering"" board. You could imagine how much fun a card like that could be. Plus, they made it from the start and were already in print. Plus, they're just fun.

Second, this board was super cheap and a lot of fun. It is also very easy to assemble, so this really does make an ""artifact"" – if you wanted a real one, it would cost you $20 – $25.

Third, I actually bought a sheet of plastic cardboard for this. I figured I could paint my art on it. You should buy a sheet of plastic cardboard to use for cards as well. It has a lot more surface area and there are no scratches. (To me, $13 was very cheap!)

These are just a few features I added to my ""artifact"" project. I've been doing lots of different crafts lately (the little ""thingy-thing"" that I'm talking about is very important for me!), and I really liked the design I got. However, they did not work out very well for me.

After I made some of these little pieces, I realized I did not want to actually paint them. I thought maybe they'd look too ""spooky"" – they would just fade to black when someone pees on them. So I went with the ""artifact"" approach and then went and made a ""silly"" item. This is just me making up crazy ideas.

In this day of social media pushing the news,  we need an independent media. The media, to me, is the biggest scam in society. It is used by the establishment to manufacture fear and create political correctness, and it is used by the people to create hope and a sense of justice. If we cannot have independent media, the future will be very dark indeed. We need an independent media to get us to our rightful place in the universe.

I am writing to express my deepest condolences and thanks to anyone who feels comfortable discussing this matter with me. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you'd like the matter handled professionally.

We are all still in the midst of this incredible moment of human change, and in these moments, we should be careful. The media is going to be the big elephant keeping us alive just long enough to continue the charade. We have the capacity for transformation and we can always use it, but the powerful few will hold onto power. I think this is why we are experiencing such a great moment of hope and hope for everything we stand for and hold at the highest level.

The media is one of the greatest tools the American people have for spreading the word, a tool that is used by the elites to divide us and divide each and every one of us. I cannot stress enough how deeply we need an independent media to give voice to all of us in this time. If you feel comfortable speaking to journalists, please feel free to email me (my full name is not publicly displayed, but everyone who is aware of me has been aware of my true identity and will receive a response). I do not see, and never have seen, anyone in the media who has ever been treated fairly by any media outlet.

I know we are getting far along right now with our presidential election, but if we could be more diligent, just imagine what the political situation would look like if things kept on as they are now. I truly believe that if you all take this massive opportunity to become fully involved in your own democracy right now, when all of the power is concentrated in your hands and when there are just a few individuals who have managed to hold it for so long, there is always a chance that the most powerful people on earth will be able to crush us.

"DONALD RUMSELD HUMILIATES “The View” Dingbat Joy Behar…Calls Her Out For Not Understanding How Presidents Are Elected [VIDEO] There is no question that Whoopi Goldberg is a talented actress and has the ability to make people laugh, but the gift of comedy that Whoopi used to make herself so popular with her fans has mostly disappeared, and has been replaced with a hostility that is anything but funny.  There has been a steady stream of comedians trying to use Whoopi's popularity to make themselves successful, but who are these comedians? Are they comedians? Or are they political figures? If they are comedians in disguise, what is a comedian, a liberal, and a celebrity really like, and how does whoopi Goldberg fit into this landscape of comedy?

""Whoopi Goldberg, Whoopi Goldberg, Whoopi Goldberg"" is a show about a bunch of famous people who got together to try to create a ""Celeb Divas"" movie based on the song from the Whoopi Goldberg movie whooping contest that came out in 1993. In the song, ""The Whooping Contest,"" Howie Mandel plays whooping. After many rounds of whinging and whooping, the judges decide to bring together a group of celebrity whiners to create the movie, which would then be released in theaters that year.

The Whoopi Goldberg Show follows the show with more of the same, but it has more comedic value. The show has two main acts: Whoopi Goldberg's husband, comedian Jim Carrey, and her stand-up buddy, comedian Bill Cosby (although Cosby is also the stand up guy's friend/superfan). Carrey is the most humorous of these two acts, although Carrey's joke about being murdered by a Whoopi Goldberg fan is more memorable. These characters are very funny because they are so different from each other, and different voices on the same comedy routine. They're hilarious to the point of absurdity, and are just really interesting to watch when they happen. Bill Cosby is the star of the show, and the main reason why so many of these comedians like him and want to work with him. Bill's relationship with Whoopi Goldberg and the two of them playing Whomping Whoopin is the reason why there is one joke that is funny in the whole comedy universe that all of this shows: It's Bill Cosby's relationship with the Whoopi Goldberg universe; his relationship to the song ""The Whooping Contest"" and to Whopi Goldberg. You don't have to have an answer to that, but it's something that makes the show hilarious, and it makes one wonder what comedy has come in the past 30 years or so that wasn't funny because it showed such a love for Whoopi Goldberg.

The show started off as an entertainment show back in the late 80s, but has slowly evolved over the series' four (",1
"TICKING TIME BOMB: Why More Young Muslims In The West Are Sympathizing With Terrorists These are statistics are shocking and very telling.

At least five people have been confirmed to have died as a result of the blaze that engulfed Grenfell in May, with many others saying they lost loved ones in the blaze.

Police have said many more people are under care, and one local authority has described the building as one of the most dangerous in London.

On Thursday afternoon, Theresa May tweeted: """"Our thoughts go out to the innocent victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and emergency services. I'm sure the first response and help for the hundreds of people affected will have been greatly appreciated.""

This evening, her Cabinet secretary Damian Green tweeted: """"In light of reports today that the fire had caused at least five people to be killed and many more missing, a statement from the prime minister is welcome.""

He later clarified his statement: ""I should not have meant to take the time to include London Mayor Sadiq Khan, or have made reference to my Cabinet Secretary with the comment he posted.""

The Labour leadership has been under fire since the Sunday Mirror reported in April that at least 40 people had already been interviewed following the fire, and hundreds of firefighters were called, despite authorities saying the emergency services were on hand, having only been given a two-hour ""red light"" warning.

Some have since claimed Labour MPs were involved in covering-up the disaster with a 'cover up'.

On Monday night, Theresa May attempted to play down the incident when asked if there had been any ""cover-up"" by Labour party officials at the weekend. She said: ""Absolutely not.""

On Thursday, Mrs May was questioned for six hours on the question by Andrew Neil. The PM then claimed that she was doing everything she could to get her husband a job as part of her effort to make sure his ""career is secured.""

The interview took place while she was on a visit to Liverpool looking forward to addressing the British Chambers of Commerce on Tuesday. Downing Street said: ""Both were held in the early hours of this morning. There was an incident on the ground which made our colleagues very uncomfortable.""

"Michael Moore Wants A Spot in Hillary’s Cabinet Given the shameless, over-the-top, almost breathtakingly cloying pro-Hillary promotional hype that Michael Moore has been spouting recently (roughly, since mid-July), the only explanation is that this man—this pride of Flint, Michigan, this modest film documentarian who grew up middle-class but is now worth upwards of $50 million—secretly harbors a desire  for Hillary for one simple reason: to be on her side while her ""basket of deplorables""—those who agree with her most on social issues—voted against her.

If you're a regular reader of This is 40, then this probably makes perfect sense (though not necessarily in the ""I'm a liberal, so I'll vote for Hillary—if she's up and running""—sense), until you notice, above all, her lack of experience or insight. As a former college student struggling in the corporate world (having recently taken a year off, after a terrible semester) and struggling to pay for college—her mother is a full-time secretary for a large health care company—she'd make a great Hillary Clinton surrogate. But not for the reasons she suggests here—for lack of experience, for lack of insight, for ignorance, for all that, of course.

Moore's film is in essence (at least among its fans) a glorified parody of the media—the kind that gives a big, positive spin (as in ""You voted against Michael Moore."" ) and ignores the many unpleasant, and ultimately damaging, truths embedded in the news. And in all its grandeur and excess of emotion there is a real-life example of the exact opposite problem. The documentary also does not examine many of the many people who have signed the petition against her candidacy (a mere 826 names of whom have signed to date, compared to the one million Trump did last month alone).

That was one of the many things that impressed Meijer on her visit to Flint.

""This is not our city,"" said Michael Moore, the producer who has been fighting the campaign for months in Flint and who also made The Passion of the Christ.

As Meijer noted, it's too late for the Michigan governor to be prosecuted for lying on a television commercial, for which this city is well-accustomed (as was the case in Detroit). What's more: there is no evidence to suggest that this man was a demonstrable threat to the city's citizens or to the local police force.

But, at least, the media is having an issue with this. The campaign for the Republican presidential nominee has been going on for many weeks now (""We all know there will be no votes for Trump this November…"" ), and all of this is a reaction to a documentary (directed by Moore, with music by Taylor Swift, ""Passion"") about that campaign (in which an",1
" #BringBackObama Hashtag Blows Up On Twitter As Americans Share Memories (TWEETS) The six months since President Donald Trump was inaugurated have been somewhat of an adventure, albeit not a particularly enjoyable one for most of us, so in the wake of Trump s latest turmoils involving himself, his son, and Russia, many took to Twitter on Wednesday while feeling more than  a little sad (sorry). That's right—we're sad again. After all, our president has been a good deal for us as well, giving us so many things in return, whether its keeping the government open or ending Obamacare and ending nuclear war…

Not so much in the realm of foreign policy, though. We're actually better off now. With Trump coming back from a 10-day Asia trip, the rest of his foreign-policy team took on duties that were more traditional for new, non-nationality heads of state, including the secretary of state, national security adviser, the secretary of interior, and the U.N. ambassador.

First, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will oversee all international discussions. While there are exceptions for the U.S. to intervene militarily in Syria and Yemen, this job seems to be largely confined to his role as head of Exxon Mobil, which oversees many of the most important oil fields in Asia. His predecessor John Kerry played an equally important role in his successor's push for the oil and gas concessions that were the backbone of the U.S.-China ""pivot"" to the Pacific during the Obama presidency, which eventually resulted in a deal for over 100 billion barrels of oil. There were many other examples from the past two decades of this process, but none more so than in the deal that China signed with Japan before Trump was inaugurated.

President Trump spoke by phone for the first time and also met with Russia's president Xi Jinping this summer and then held talks with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto this week. He also made a speech in Saudi Arabia and traveled this summer to the European Parliament to meet with leaders of all seven member countries.

On Tuesday, Trump's pick for the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, was also announced, bringing a significant presence to the position. Pompeo has been a leading advocate for the idea of using drones of U.S. citizens as a means of conducting targeted killing abroad. On Monday, the former Army officer gave a speech about drones in which, rather than talking about their uses and their limitations, he made the point that they are a good way of killing individuals, or ""baiters,"" and that killing an innocent person overseas in this way might be less effective—or not.

This last claim is not entirely without precedent. This is not the first time that the Obama White House had publicly challenged or even protested the American use of Predator drones over American soil. In 2010, when then-",1
" Trump Got An Eight-Year-Old American Girl Killed, Along With Other Children And Women Donald Trump is an incompetent commander-in-chief and he just proved it with the first military raid he ordered.Since December 2014, the United States had refrained from putting boots on the ground in Yemen to fight terrorists because the region has become so dangerous and unstable.President Obama effectively used drone strikes  to kill suspected al-Qaida and Taliban leaders. But this month, the Obama administration ordered a massive military operation in Yemen to fight Islamist militants that are using Yemen as their hideout, and the operation was conducted under the Obama administration.The U.S. has launched thousands of strikes against Islamic State (ISIS) and other terrorists in Syria in the last three months alone.The most recent strike was on May 17 in Al Jawf, about 25 miles west of Sanaa, the capital. More than 20,000 were reported killed. The Obama administration has repeatedly warned the Yemeni people and the international community that the airbase in Al Jawf can provide safe haven for al-Qaida-linked terrorists if they can't be killed in a proper operation.Last September, President Obama ordered the military operation in Al Jawf. It was meant to ""clear the area of terrorist camps and gather intelligence and intelligence-gathering resources"" in order to help President Hassan Rouhani win international legitimacy by ending Iran's hostility to the United States.But Iranian president Hassan Rouhani didn't get a clear victory from his own country's intervention in Yemen. The Houthis were able to hold their own and take out an entire airbase at Al Jawf, and they even tried to get the Houthis to negotiate.But the Obama administration is clearly determined to pursue Al Jawf even after U.S. intervention in Yemen. In a letter from Secretary of State John Kerry to the Houthis on the eve of the mission, Kerry wrote: ""U.S. action will demonstrate to Iran and its allies that military action with or without the kind of support that was provided to Mr. Rouhani could be dangerous and destabilizing if it continued.""Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told reporters in July that the U.S. was now ready to take military action in Yemen, in its response to Al Qaeda's threats and the terrorist threat posed by the Houthis. But, he added, ""That may not be a satisfactory strategy right now to deter an attack on our soil on behalf of our people.""""After this operation, we're ready to go into full-spectrum war -- on all fronts.""Secretary of State John Kerry, whose visit to the region last week ended with the signing of an UN Security Council resolution and a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to Yemen, said that the United States will now conduct regular air operations in Yemen against al Qaeda and its allies.""The military strategy we've pursued in the last three years is working,"" Kerry said.

He promised it would be ""beautiful,"" and said that if Mexico paid for it, he would make Mexico pay for it.

Now the president is promising to build a wall along the US-Canada border, an idea that has been in the making by some presidents.

Trump's plan has already sparked debate among a select group of Mexican politicians: the president, and his family, will receive a portion of future revenues from Mexico that would flow into a trust fund dedicated to helping the struggling Mexican middle classes.

Mexico would help the children of Americans, too

This is a common idea in Europe and other parts of Asia. In Europe, the principle is that when governments borrow money, they help impoverished families in order to grow their own income and wealth.

In China and Japan in particular, the concept of ""welfare sharing"" has taken root in the past decades of rapid industrialization. Most wealthy middle-income countries — like Canada, Germany and the United States — have already implemented at",1

" DNC Insiders Vote To Take Bernie’s Win In New Hampshire Away From Him (IMAGES) You may or may not know this, but the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has a system in place that s capable of overriding the will of the people when the popular vote doesn t quite match up with what the establishment has in mind. Due to DNC rules put into  place in 2008, if the Democrats get more delegates over the top of winning popular vote share, they will take the White House. We see this very specifically from Sanders' victory in Indiana. At that time the Democratic nominee received 482 delegates, while Sen. Sanders received 1,073 delegates. The DNC would then have the right to eliminate Sanders from the ballot.


With only 799 pledged delegates, the DNC would have won the presidency if Sanders had garnered 1,082 delegates over the next six primaries and caucuses in states Sanders won. In other words, if Sanders had managed to gather 1,082 pledged delegates before June 7, Sanders would have won the election.


This is called ""compromise"" and it's a powerful tool to ensure that voters of all political persuasions are heard. The Democratic platform states there are ""no limits"" on the amount of money a candidate or political party can spend. The platform says Clinton can raise as much as $5 million from the super PACs she sets up under the Federal Election Commission. As an independent of the DNC, Clinton would not lose the popular vote but if she had not secured the 2,383 pledged delegates, she would have lost as well. That means if a candidate's campaign only won two states (Iowa and New Hampshire), Clinton would have no chance of winning the White House.


If Clinton had received the 2,383 pledged delegates, she would have won the presidency, while Republican nominee Donald Trump would have easily been a lock with 1,237 delegates. If Sanders had received the required delegates, he would have won the election.


This scenario is not a game changer for Clinton, who has already declared a war on Wall Street.


Sanders has already called on his supporters to vote for him, but he would then need 3,383 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination before voting ends, if Sanders does not receive enough of them, and that would be a huge undertaking for Clinton.


The Democratic establishment has said the outcome of the general election will be called ""Super Tuesday"" and is looking forward to winning in at least 35 states. But that could change depending on how popular the candidates are. If Clinton won only in the Democratic states where Sanders drew some big crowds, she might end up losing the election. At the very least, that would be a devastating loss for her candidacy.


If Sanders had managed to garner many more than 537 delegates, the nomination would surely be secured, but the fact that Clinton did",1

"MELANIA TRUMP IN RARE ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW: Watch Her DESTROY Leftist MSNBC Hack On Immigration…”I Followed The Law!” Melania Trump has been taking a relatively low key position in her husband s bid to become our next President. She s more than just arm candy for Donald Trump. She s a tough business woman who s proud to have come to America as an immigrant and earned her  business acumen.

She worked tirelessly from her early days as a maid to the restaurant where she worked her way on the restaurant ladder through her many many years as executive chef where she continues to win the hearts over millions every year of Americans for her impeccable service and quality food.

While Melania Trump has given more thought of her husband s journey than anyone else in her family, she has refused to let the election result make people less worried about what she intends to do for the United States for the next eight years in office.

In fact, Hillary made the point to her daughter Ivanka earlier this month that the election of Donald Trump would be the beginning of one of her biggest political nightmares. She said that she wanted to make sure her children knew she s intent to bring back the America she s dreamt of during her childhood in the country.

She s speech came as Melania was working with a little girl over the weekend preparing the dinner table for the three children. Melania s remarks were extremely powerful and she stated that she hopes Donald Trump elects to spend all of his time focused on his family rather than on politics. She added that she s plans for her children and all of the children will follow in her footsteps so she should focus on her business as usual

She s words are certainly the right ones. She does not want her country or her family to lose a chance to make America great again; Donald Trump s plan seems to me like it will happen and she needs to accept whatever the consequences may be.

For as a business and family woman, Melania s words are well considered. I think we can all agree that these words should help her to know that her dreams of making America great again will never happen without her husband s support but I do understand their gravity.

The American people did a remarkable job of giving her what she s deserved in this election, and Melania s words are exactly why people want President s hands again.

Melania s family is as tight lipped as ever about what exactly Donald Trump s plans are but at the moment Donald Trump s plan seems to be his choice for Vice President.

Melania s family has a large amount of control over all aspects of her presidential bid as President elect and this will be a huge challenge for them. It could be that Melania s family has made some big choices in this election. It s also very likely that Donald Trump s VP pick would have very little to do with her political future when it comes to how the",1

"DIVERSITY GONE WILD: US Government Plans To Replace Alexander Hamilton On $10 Bill With A Woman… We re living in such historic times I can barely take all the diversity and equality Help us to choose the woman the Obama regime will select to replace Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill (below). The Treasury Department is preparing to announce that they are putting a woman on  the presidential $10 bill as ""First Lady of the United States of America"". Now we know the names of those behind this decision, because on December 14th, 2014, the Obama regime announced that they would allow the appointment of a woman (with no nomination or confirmation by the US Senate), but no formal Senate confirmation vote was necessary for her to be granted the position. This should be an outrage because in an effort to help women in the workplace and to create a more enlightened society, there are numerous programs that exist that would require an equal number of women working in leadership positions and in high level governmental positions. That includes gender equality in the workforce--there are many policies such as Equal Pay Day and Employee Equal Pay, where women can seek compensation for equal labor income and if such discrimination is proven, a claim can be brought to court on behalf of the employee and not in the form of a claim on behalf of the employer. It is worth mentioning that the Obama regime has also given women over 50 years of age equal pay rights with men in all facets of American life. And although the Obama regime has been known to have the greatest disdain for women, to those of us who live in America, there is no need, no justification, no matter what the Obama regime chooses to do, for them to continue giving women even less access to jobs in important fields such as politics, healthcare, education, finance, and more. The only reason this woman, who was a Democrat even before she was elected, even if she were to be a good woman, is even considered for the job of the First Lady is as a political pawn, a publicity item that she can use to garner sympathy from women to get elected, or if she is fortunate enough for a Republican to win the election; or if she gets her way, we can always look forward to a more liberal women in positions of power on this country to protect us from such abuses in such industries. The reason she was approved to serve is because it was proven that the Obama regime did the honorable thing in their power to nominate a woman. But what does ""the honorable thing"" entail? Well, if our First Lady was not as qualified as we should have been to appoint her to the role, that is another story that we can tell ourselves. If we thought that her candidacy was being unfairly ""targeted"" to us because she was ""youngish"" or a woman in the ""hip"" era of this party, we would be absolutely correct. But we do not need a ""Targeted",1

Lincoln Police Capt. Andrew Slick said police would not reveal the suspect's name because he was ""a threat to the community.""

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday said he believed the suspect should be charged with murder as a hate crime.

According to a statement issued on Twitter, the suspect said he didn't know the children who were among the dead, and he had the children's parents called.

The incident followed a mass shooting last month at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 children and six adults were killed and 24 more injured.

Killing spree that has left 10 people dead, including first-grader, in two schools in Umpqua Community College

Lincoln police released graphic video of the suspect, who had been armed with a pistol and a handgun, walking up behind the victims and firing several shots.

According to a statement from Umpqua Community College President Richard L. W. Scott, students who died were the victims of a ""shocking and senseless act of violence.""

""Today, a tragic shooting and tragic loss of life occurred and our hearts and prayers go out to everyone affected, and all the victims of this senseless crime.""

Scott said some injured students had temporary disorientations after the shooting but had made it home and were recovering.

He also said three students, four faculty members and an engineer went to the site of the shooting.

According to the statement, the suspect took one victim's jacket and gave the jacket to another student after he noticed someone ""acting strangely"" and then opened the door.

Police have not disclosed information about the motive for the mass shooting.

A New Cisco Security Feature: Smart Card Audit (SFSA)

A new option for Cisco Unified Security Appliance is Smart Card Audit. As stated recently in Cisco Security Blog article, Smart Card Audit is an audit feature that requires all Cisco Unified Security Appliances (UIAs) to have a Smart Card Audit feature as well. The SFSA tool uses the built-in auditing method (called SCTS) with audit mode enabled. The aim is to detect failures from the audit mode and then apply proper error correction. For audit mode enabled, the audit mode is based on the SCTS audit mode. So, a particular audit mode is used for the audit mode, in conjunction with another audit mode that is based on SCTS audit mode:

""Look, America's in a world when people are making deals for other countries and making deals for other countries and it doesn't make sense to us how an American president can walk away after we've negotiated this trade agreement,"" Garrett said ""I would just add, but that may be a good time to note, the President was not a part of this conversation, and I think you also know that the President's policy on trade is the policy of his own people and not mine. President Obama can't be part of trying to negotiate an agreement that he, and the president, personally supports or oppose, and you certainly know that that takes a lot of time and energy.""

CBS, to its credit, pointed out the importance of this agreement.

If you want to talk about the President and his policy then you'd better get to the facts and you also want to be prepared to argue -- and show the press why you don't have to be afraid to tell the truth and what it would take to reach these types of agreements...It's not enough now to say he couldn't have negotiated this with Iran.""

You could hear it coming. That the CBS segment was about the agreement between Iran in principle, and also some people getting killed, didn't stop the pressers from asking the President for a chance to defend his policy on the nuclear negotiations. For example, during the interview with Garrett earlier, Garrett mentioned one of Carter's own supporters on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. As in: 'Why is the President so opposed to the agreement that he and his administration signed last September?'

This question got the President's attention. His response? When he says, ""I'm never going to say to people who have been here or been in this business that this is not our role,"" he's talking about the jobs and benefits the deal will bring.

""I actually do think that we have a responsibility about our relationship with Russia. Russia is our second largest trade partner, with Mexico the United States has two",1
"#BlackLivesMatter Terrorists Using #BlackRail On Twitter To Organize Shut Down Of Rail Before MN Vikings Game Sanctioned domestic terrorists taking direction from our Organizer In Chief and funding from his billionaire marxist friend, George Soros. Are there new laws about acts of terrorism and threats against Americans that we re unaware of? Since when did it become okay to threaten innocent people taking their families on  a holiday? You'll never guess.

I've never in my life thought it is okay to threaten others on national TV, anywhere, to tell me how to vote, or how to speak. Now that's the definition of political terrorism. Why are we so scared of being terrorized by those who hate us because we are white?

There is a reason these terrorist groups don't attack us on our own soil, instead we have to go through a foreign country that hates us and wants to eradicate us as there is no safe place for us anymore.

I am deeply sorry for my behavior this weekend. I am sure there are plenty of decent Christian citizens who are angry enough with the way I have treated them to come up with a new approach…just like people all over the USA will come up with a new approach once Barack Obama is out of office.

The bottom line is that people believe something in the way they see it. It all comes down to what those seeing them believe, or don't. It's easy enough to tell someone who is offended that they are wrong. It takes a little more brainwashing of some kind.

If the Christians were not so afraid to come forward and say something about their behavior, I would find that so painful to endure. But we know from experience, people will defend what they believe. In fact, there is much more to God's truth than what some people see in their minds.

For those who are uncomfortable discussing a past controversy or are fearful of speaking out and saying something negative about our President, the real problem is the fact that so many Christians are too afraid to say anything at all. There could be so much more to say about that whole event, especially since Obama and the Christians know more than the average citizen!

But we have to live with a reality. All political discussions can be boiled down to their basic elements. We have to choose between the Christian and the Obama, between the candidate who wants to do good that the rest of the country is opposed to and the one who wants to do no good at all, between the candidate who loves God and is honest because he likes to hear people say the truth and the one who is a bully or lying or out of touch. Of course, God may allow a candidate to get away with his or her policies, but for God's sake, stop being such a coward and say something. If there are any Christian leaders among us who could speak at a press conference and say any reasonable",1

Of that total, AT&T alone paid $938 million, according to the new study, which found that all of the compensation had been split evenly among the parties.

The findings were a blow to consumer advocacy organizations nationwide that have been warning about an increasing concentration of power in these companies, both to protect their market share and to avoid legal action of their own.

AT&T has been the leading opponent of new legislation that tries to curb its ability to steer customers to sites that it believes support abusive practices. In 2011, for example, AT&T settled 13 claims involving deceptive customer service.

But in September, the U.S. District Court in Houston upheld the Justice Department's ruling that the court had not found companies were guilty of unlawful copyright infringement. While that ruling was based on the Justice Department's investigation that looked only at whether the company had broken the company's copyright law, it effectively left many other lawsuits against it unresolved. One of those cases resulted in the $4.25 million in damages for Comcast, a cable company.

" Ivanka Trump’s Dress Was Nice, But There Was One MAJOR Problem With It (VIDEO) A consistent theme among Donald Trump s rhetoric, and last night s address to Congress was no different, is economic nationalism, which means buy and hire American. As usual, though, the words were contradicted by his own family s actions, and in particular, his favorite child, Ivanka, who wore a  business jacket and had her own business as she walked across the tarmac, and was surrounded by executives, and the press, and other members of her staff, and people of her father s administration. Trump took this opportunity to say that as president he would protect immigrants and refugees. His administration would be ""the most pro-American administration ever,"" a pledge that is echoed by many of his cabinet members. This statement and Trump s policies are antithetical to the values of America that has defined our country since the days of Abraham Lincoln, who signed the Emancipation Proclamation on March 1, 1863 .

But of course, he didn t say much more. Trump s rhetoric about immigrants was often criticized, but, again, he made them sound like they were the root of evil and crime. He said that as president, his administration would protect religious freedom, the right to pray and exercise a faith, and the belief that religious diversity is a strength of our country. The president told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that he would enforce existing trade laws. He said that the United States would negotiate better deals with Europe. He promised to get tough over national security threats, such as nuclear proliferation and climate change. He said that the United States will renegotiate trade deals to keep their jobs and profits at home.

But Trump s priorities seem more focused on his daughter s business than what is good for American workers and American prosperity. Ivanka appeared on Fox News Channel a little over a week before the elections and spoke of Ivanka s vision for the brand: ""A brand that speaks only to the American people,"" she said. The New York Times reported that Ivanka described her father s administration as an administration focused on the protection of traditional values. To these principles she added a new, more personal one: ""For the first time, President-elect Trump is taking us back to bedrock American values. We see them in the strong work ethic instilled in young children, the confidence that our people can rise to the greatest challenges, the sense that our freedoms are protected and expanded, that you are not forgotten or forgotten the minute you step on that escalator. ... A brand that makes its product that our children and grandchildren will wear forever."" Her words echo the sentiments of the president-elect himself, who in his victory speech on December 15, 2016, spoke about American exceptionalism, the promise of America to the world that has shaped U.S. foreign policy since the founding of the country in 1776. In all of these areas, and",1
" Numbskull Ben Carson Just Managed To P*ss Off Every Decent Parent In America Ben Carson may be the dumbest person ever to perform brain surgery. He has proven time and time again that he has no clue on matters of simple science issue,s and has demonstrated a lack of critical thinking skills that have landed in the pants on fire category of fact . If you want someone to prove how dumb Trump can get by looking at him and other people, then maybe go find a candidate you believe in who has demonstrated a lack of critical thinking skills like Carson has. He could be a great choice, because he already has proven he is one of the dumbest people ever.

Carson has been a supporter of the Trans Pacific Partnership. The TPP is a horrible trade deal that is causing so much suffering and hardship to the United States of America and its people. For years he has been telling America that it would get a better deal from NAFTA if it would simply drop the TPP and focus on the economy as a whole. Trump told Bloomberg News recently that if this was his goal this was an excellent way to get into office, and while Trump is correct about all of the negatives with NAFTA his main problem with the U.S. economy is the fact that in the last four years, U.S. workers have seen real wage growth of under 1% and real income growth of 9%, which means that they are taking on a debt burden that has grown more rapidly than real wages. If we want to see a government that puts the needs of working people first, like Trump promised, this is one way to do it. There have even been some positive articles written about this policy that show that the government is doing a good job of it.

Carson opposes all forms of immigration, especially from Mexico. He seems to think that immigration from Mexico comes in the form of workers, mostly young people working the country with little education and even worse jobs than the U.S. employed native-born Americans.

He voted against equal pay for women for almost 30 years. He doesn't know if any of these facts actually apply to all of the working moms, and many of the women workers in the U.S. have been very lucky, if not lucky, in those jobs.

For one thing, I want to tell you that all of those facts, Carson's lack of knowledge on the above mentioned issues, his support for trade with Mexico, his support for immigration from Mexico is all the more impressive for being true given the numerous articles written about it that say that the U.S., under Trump, is facing significant challenges.

A lot of other things, however, are true, as well. He has said that he is a big fan of Hillary Clinton and in fact he has voted for her multiple times, so she is his second choice for U.S",1
"Iraqi Army Discovers US-Made Missiles in ISIS’s Military Base We Are Change Iraqi Army Discovers US-Made Missiles in ISIS’s Military Base in Mosul Iraqi army and popular forces have discovered a number of US-made missiles from a military position of the ISIS (ISIL, IS, Daesh) in the Southern part of Mosul, informed local sources disclosed after the first group  of military operations to retake the city ended today.

Iraqi forces and popular forces managed to seize control of several military positions surrounding the oil-producing city in the Iraqi Nineveh province.

According to the reports by Iraqi sources, Iraqi armed forces and popular forces have discovered a number of US-designed missiles from a military position.

The weapons and devices, which were captured during an operation to take back the oil pumping station of Mosul in the Nineveh province in Northern Iraq, were made with US-made RDX propellants and have different configurations of fins and missile systems.

The weapons were brought to the Iraqi capital Baghdad by an American mercenary company and were handed over to the Iraqi army after Iraqi troops and their Popular Mobilisation Forces carried out a security operation in the city.

The vehicles were found in the control center of a major oil extraction station in the vicinity of Mosul. The American troops have claimed that the Iraqi army has been unable to use its own rockets and ammunition because the weapons of several factions of the terrorist organization were taken from them.

American soldiers and their Popular Mobilisation Forces have so far taken control of six oil stations of the Islamic State in the northern city. Iraqi troops seized control of two oil plants of the group in the city and brought them under control.<|endoftext|>What exactly is the relationship between the National Weather Service Forecast system is the weather data and forecast system created by the National Weather Service during the year of the month of September. The system is used to give the forecast of where the weather will continue to get colder when compared to other months of the year. These forecasts are created by an algorithm based on weather forecast models and data provided by the National Weather Service to the public for each of the 60 days in a year. The system provides the following information: Temperature - which is determined by atmospheric air temperature or surface air temperature and the air temperature at ground level.

Spiration - temperature (or relative humidity) of air relative to that at which it is moving relative to the ground level.

Warm up time - The temperature of the air relative to that at which the ground is rising relative to that at which it is cooling.

Average wind velocity - a measure of the air's movement relative to the ground and at atmospheric heights. At the top of your ears is where the wind is blowing. The mean wind velocity is the wind's speed plus a small amount.

"The Destiny Of The World 39 Views November 05, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News With continued uncertainty in global markets, today the man who has become legendary for his predictions on QE, historic moves in currencies, and major global events, spoke with King World News about the destiny of the world. Egon von  Greyerich The man who was the driving force behind the Gold Standard and was the author of The Road to Serfdom and The Great Depression, the current chief strategist at Morgan Stanley, and one of the world's foremost economic thinkers. He is considered the world's best economist and has been known throughout history to predict the future from economics. He is best known for his research into credit and banking bubbles. Egon spoke: In the past, gold was king of the precious metals. If you had gold in every country then gold was king of the world. At that time, Gold was worth a lot more than $1,000. The world was rich, and people thought that gold was the most valuable thing on earth.

Gold really didn't have much value because it was worthless in every country, because its value was fixed. It was only the value of gold, or silver, or platinum. Everything about the world that was really valuable, gold, was really worthless. As for the price of gold? What kind of price is there then? What is the value of all of us in this world? Because it was all in these prices. You have to give us these precious metals. You buy them for these real-life conditions, which is when they get really valuable. And if their value is just a little bit higher, then I think we will be a better country. Because with every hour we make, you get greater comfort with yourself. And if you don't use them because they're valuable, you may become too sensitive to them, too greedy. What is the value of the people? The value of the people of this world is not in the price of gold or other precious metals. They don't think that gold or silver are precious. They think that when your life ends, when your money loses all it's value, and the world becomes worse because it becomes desperate to get what the average person, that's the value of the value of your life. It's always in the values of the people who are living in the real world.

For your life to end, when everybody's lives end, if you don't use these resources, then you'll end up impoverished and homeless. So it's not easy for people to use them right now because the world's resources will become depleted. There must be a lot of countries which don't have sufficient resources or insufficient people to be able to use these resources in a short period of time. We are facing these enormous challenges. To change, it",1
"Kim Kardashian The Queen Of Selfies Retires Her Booty From Breaking The Internet Tuesday, 1 November 2016 Kim Kardashian: The Queen Of Selfies The world wide web has been crashing, due to suffering from withdrawals of Kim Kardashian's daily selfies. Kim was the queen of breaking the internet with her big booty, and it wasn't always from her sitting on it! Once upon  a time, I would have thought she was an artist, but it seems there's nothing quite like watching the camera roll, or watching the internet take a snap of her and shoot us all. Her boobs would be everywhere, her hair all over the place, her face as the center of the scene, her hair everywhere, and her boobs like a balloon. Her face and boobs are always the center of attention. And she will always be the subject for her camera, never to be touched again! My only question is this: ""Do you ever check your Facebook feed to make sure nobody is taking selfies of you?""

I would never get to hear his voice, and I am very sad to see him not live to see the fruits of his immense talents. Kanye West, like the rest of us, may die tonight, but I always hope it be so I can finally see you again. It's time for everyone to finally see a real black American rapper.

We didn't see anything that was overly obvious. I got to experience a scene or two where they were really just making the show up on the fly. I was really eager and surprised how many amazing things they did with their characters and their environment. I loved every bit of it, but the characters kept getting in, out, and around the camera. The ending was really exciting and felt good to watch. That being said, the episodes I've come to expect from NGE were a bit disappointing. They were well paced, but it only took about a minute for them to get to the action. I think they could have done a better job with how they were using the world and how people interacted with each other. It took them a while to develop a scene with all the different places they were in. It could easily have kept increasing the tension in their scenes.

The ending was okay, but it wasn't as emotional to me as I thought they could have. There were other points later in the series with characters where I wish they had put some more emphasis on characters and not on the plot. It had me laughing a good deal so I think there were a couple good points or moments that came across that way. The pacing really slowed after the first half hour.

I really enjoyed this series, it really pushed me to learn more about the characters and what is their relationship to one another, their relationship to society, what they see, hear, touch, hear. The characters are all amazing and I really enjoyed having to constantly look over my shoulder. They really do make me want to learn more about the world I'm in as well as look over my shoulder and see which of the people or places is real and which is not. The whole thing is really well paced for me.


In general, I don't think a lot of people watch these shows because they expect it to end. Well, this isn't the case in my opinion, so if you're a fan of anything supernatural, I hope you will not be disappointed. I'm really looking forward to seeing how these stories develop and I hope to come back for more as time goes by and to meet more of these amazing characters from the manga that I'm so lucky to have read about",1
"John McCain to Donald Trump: 'Don’t You Dare Make Peace with Russia!' http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/john-mccain-to-donald-trump-dont-you.html Sit down. This is going to shock you. (Not). We reported yesterday on the telephone call between US president-elect Trump and Russian president Putin, where the current and future presidents discussed the need to set aside differences and look to more constructive future relations. With serious observers of this  important phone call concluding that this should be the key to reaching a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis, I think the only reasonable explanation is that this was the result of a telephone conversation between US President-elect Trump and Russian president Putin. I do think there is a sense within the intelligence community (and especially in his presidential transition team) that Mr Putin's intelligence services are operating on several different fronts at the moment with respect to the US presidential election. We don't know exactly what he believes about the US presidential election, but it certainly seems to me that he needs to establish some understanding of some of the facts of this campaign, and that, while he is not fully in the loop as to what has happened within this presidential campaign, in any event his intelligence services have a very strong view that US president-elect Trump is not sufficiently ready for prime time. Russian President Vladimir Putin's intelligence services have the same view about the US presidential election as we do about what has happened, and they are working to create a consensus regarding some of the issues. It is also worth noting that there are now indications that the CIA knew from the beginning of the effort to discredit the Clinton campaign that the Russians were doing this operation to help Trump win. This is why I think the Russian intelligence services were going to be involved in the campaign to disrupt this outcome. But in this case if there has been genuine cooperation from the Russian side it is certainly not as a result of the phone call. If you look at Mr Putin's reaction after he was contacted for the call, he was very disappointed with, well, actually in all the statements, very disappointed that he was contacted by the President, not just a few of his closest friends, but that he was contacted. He did not feel that there was anything on his mind. He wanted the details of the conversation between the President of this country and his foreign minister, the Russian foreign ministry, to be released. And then, of course, he was very angry that he was asked to confirm this with him when that is absolutely not the case, which, of course, he did not say. So he says, no, let the Americans release what has indeed been done. But he is in a very tense position: The phone call was done by the President of the United States without anyone in his camp telling him that it had occurred. Mr Putin then wanted to check with the US ambassador, he wanted to say to the ambassador, oh no, did you find anything? The embassy said, we also did not find anything",1
"BUSTED: HILLARY’S MEDIA CHEERLEADERS Caught Hiding Truth About Most Corrupt Candidate Ever During Live Interviews [VIDEO] Wow! This compilation of blatant blocking for Hillary is beyond embarrassing and these journalists should be serving time for journalistic malpractice.We all know the mainstream media is guilty of supporter the Democrat candidate for President in almost every election for decades, the question is: Are we going to allow them  to bully the people?

A poll of 447 GOP voters who identified as ""very conservative"" in 2008 found that 84 percent supported Obama but only 18 percent opposed Bill Clinton, the results showing:

The fact that the media continues to lie about these poll results is an indictment of its responsibility and responsibility is with you all, let us pray for Mr. Obama that he is elected President and we hope this is only the start of the destruction in the Democratic party because you have put the Democrats under total control of this country.

And when it was reported that the Obama campaign had used the Internet to push for voter fraud, Democrats responded by calling it ""crazy conspiracy theory.""

""This is crazy!"" exclaimed one reporter. Another said, ""Why in the world would you want to make sure people vote? What if everyone voted twice!""

A video was uploaded by conservative activist John Ralston, who claims his ""video shows voter fraud in a way that we have never seen in public before."" It demonstrates a man in a hat voting multiple times. The woman in the hat responds and the man who voted multiple times goes silent in an apparent reference to the man in the hat.

The Washington Free Beacon reported:

There's no doubt these tactics — to rig the voting process in favor of one candidate over another — is an ongoing effort,"" said Free Beacon senior editor-at-large John Ralston, who has been following this story since at least late April. ""We should believe the president's promise of transparency and accuracy when he says he has put the Obama team under federal investigation for his office's actions.""

Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt released a statement saying that there is ""no evidence"" the Obama team used the Internet to try to create fake ""voter fraud videos"" for voters to vote against.

According to CBS, Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt, and other press release, ""there is no evidence"" that the Obama campaign ""rigged our way into being behind the scenes and into the online video campaign that we know about, and we're not surprised to learn of it.""

Another Fox News report, citing multiple sources, alleged that a major U.S. intelligence agency ""is investigating the Internet voting machine claims and whether any evidence could be found that voter registration rolls in Florida and Wisconsin were compromised.""

The reports included the claim that at least three states, Ohio and Wisconsin, had been hacked as part of a scheme to try",1

As TheWrap has revealed , Trump's top campaign chairman John Podesta has reportedly been ""furious"" with the president and his administration over a series of controversies over the weekend . In particular, the controversy around the president's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey appears to have cost the Hillary Clinton campaign dearly in the final month of the campaign.

While there may be some reasons for this frustration, one may think it prudent to offer one last rebuke to Clinton and her cohorts.<|endoftext|>I have always enjoyed reading ""Mockumentaries,"" as most writers these days are too busy making a living to write these essays about their movies. I had always hoped to get back into writing ""Mockumentaries"" and, when I saw that these four articles were being written about the film The Lone Ranger, I knew I had to publish them! For most of these articles, I'm keeping these words to myself – ""I am writing this in front of others; and I think that these essays were all very well expressed, but I think that I need to express myself better, and I think that this may or may not be an improvement and I hope I have made good use of this opportunity.""

The first article on the film: ""The Movie's First Year: Early Audiences Were Not Very Bright."" This is an interesting essay and will probably get me more work now that I can share with you. The essay starts with an overview of the film, then talks about its early screenings (the one I took back the weekend before I wrote this), which are the best that early critics had for the film. Here is what I had to say about the film, and how I saw it:

I started the movie on September 16, 2013. I had taken it out with my girlfriend (a former student of mine) some weeks earlier in the summer (I was in high school.) At the start of the movie, it was showing at some local school.

"Full UFO Disclosure Is Inevitable Full UFO Disclosure Is Inevitable Nov 18, 2016 7 0 What is coming can’t be stopped. The truth is out there and we know it. While some believe that a partial disclosure of the truth on the UFO/E.T. phenomena will be pulled off, the reality is that any attempts to  influence the public toward the cause and effect of these phenomena will fail in the eyes of the majority. It is clear that what we are witnessing is, in fact, a vast, multibillion man-years-of-time deception being played for our profit. The events unfolding are a continuation and repetition of ancient history with the purpose of mankind's advancement. As these events unfold more and more information begins to surface, and each new revelation that comes out of the UFO community continues to add fuel to the fire of conspiracy theorizing. The truth will soon come out and humanity faces the greatest challenge of our time – to remain aware of our fate. Nov 18, 2016


Unconventional and Unanswered Questions Nov 19, 2016 1 Response The truth is still far from being fully explained. Most of the details of this event are still shrouded in mystery and speculation, as people simply do not want to get caught up in the latest UFO/E.T. happenings. There has even been talk of ""conspiracy theories"". What follows will explain how this whole saga started (but not what happened actually), why this whole incident is still being handled the way it is, and where we stand today. It is important for us to put ourselves in the shoes of the ordinary person, and know firsthand the true nature of the ""possible truth"". We want to know the reality behind the rumors, what happens in real life when a group of people come together to discuss something important, and to understand why what we are seeing is so strange to us. One of the most important things we can do is to start to understand what we are observing around us. It is almost impossible to understand things by watching TV alone, nor by reading an endless number of internet articles about UFO sightings. We want to understand the inner workings of the world around us as well as the hidden workings in our own minds. We have to look at things objectively, at another time, which means having close contact with the reality. We need to see, in a real way, what we are seeing in real life. That is where the real world comes into play. Here comes the mystery – with so much mystery surrounding this incident, there has always been something in between the ""fairy-tale"" and real world. The ""real world"" is when we, and everyone we are concerned with, find ourselves faced with a situation like this. There are no guarantees that a person in this situation will have a very good understanding of what is happening in their life, or how",1
"STEVIE WONDER SLAMS Black Lives Matter At MN Peace Conference: “You Cannot Say ‘Black Lives Matter’ and Then Kill Yourselves” [VIDEO] The music icon spoke at the North Minneapolis Conference on Peace on Saturday.Stevie Wonder spoke out about Black Lives Matter and youth gun violence at the North Minneapolis Conference on Peace on Saturday. It is in your hands to stop all of the killing and the shooting wherever it might  take place, he said. (Published Saturday, Aug. 11, 2017)

""The most important thing was to find answers that were nonjudgmental.""

The band has been nominated for three Grammy awards in various categories for the three albums it released between 1973 -- 'All My Loving' -- which won four Grammys.

The Grammys Awards are decided by a Best Rock or Pop Video and the winner is announced on Jan. 5. The nominees are announced every two years.

Stevie Wonder has been in the spotlight a little bit recently over his support of President Donald Trump.

""It's a big responsibility,"" he said while promoting his latest album, 'Born to Die.' ""But as a young man it was a big honor to be part of the presidency. It was the right thing to vote for in that particular election. So why not stay in the position I'm in now and continue serving my country?""

""I would say I'm going forward to make sure we're all doing the right thing and keeping this country safe and free as a people,"" he added.

Stevie Wonder joined ""Tough Love""-inspired ""All My Loving"" in January, as well.

A couple months before that, when he was promoting 'All My Loving' in early September, he took on Black Lives Matter leader Alicia Garza.

Garza called Stevie Wonder's recent comments ""unforgivable"" and ""pathetic"" and demanded that black artists, especially on the Grammy stage, take a stand.

But to help inspire the band, Wonder said the movement ""has a lot to do with us,"" with fellow black artists like David Banner and John Legend, who he's known since college, showing ""how important it is the community has unity.""

""We do not want people who look at 'all' lives and don't have empathy and who want to see those who we see as the worst off to look up to us and to say that we're really good, we're not the baddest. We're the best, we're the most compassionate, we're the most kind, and we will speak out on injustice,"" said Wonder.

""I think with any movement they have, there's always a part of that movement that thinks that that's what's missing, the sense of 'how cool is this guy? You know we didn't realize how smart he was.' That's the kind of thing we",1
"[VIDEO] BUMBLING US DEFENSE SEC. CAN’T ANSWER QUESTION ABOUT Whether Or Not We’ll Defend The 60 Syrians We’re Training To Fight ISIS Yeah you know the Obama regime is serious about taking down ISIS when they send in 60 Syrian rebels and leave them unprotected against the Assad regime. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) went straight for the jugular in questioning Defense Secretary Ash Carter at a Tuesday Senate hearing on the Obama  administration's effort to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels that President Bashar Assad cannot control. In a statement, McCain said: ""I am dismayed that Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has authorized the continued arming of unmoderates in Syria and Iraq for the purpose of fighting ISIS. ""While I agree with the president that it is necessary to train moderate forces to fight terrorism, we can do so without risking the lives of civilians. The United States must also continue our efforts to end the civil war.""

The following is the language of Senator John McCain's opening statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on ""Fulfilling President Obama's Long-Term Foreign Policy Vision: A Realistic Approach to Countering Radicalization in Syria and Iraq"" (emphasis added):

OBAMA: I just want to respond to one word: ""moderates"" for this moment are the least that we could consider when we talk about fighting ISIS. That word is misleading for those of us who think that we have to get to ""moderate"" forces that we call al-Nusra or the Assad regime or any of the other entities that we've had. We do not have that. We just simply have to train moderate forces to fight ISIS and the other terrorists that are killing people in Syria and Iraq. We don't need to send in 60 Syrian rebels to fight ISIS and it can't be done. The strategy that we're going to be moving through the United Nations is a realistic strategy. We've given that speech a lot of attention because there are people who want to see this happen and people who are concerned about what it represents and whether it's a strategy that protects the American people and protects our interests and the U.S. interests in the region. But my point is that the goal is to build up to a force that is in a position to defeat ISIS and to protect Syrian civilians. That's what's been tried and failed with that strategy. We can do better.

But, I think we could make a much bolder claim that this strategy doesn't take into account the reality on the ground. When I was a member of the Armed Services Committee, I told the administration not to send our trainers to Iraq and Afghanistan. Those are not safe haven countries. Those aren't our allies, there are no bases there and we have to do much better than this. And the idea was to send in 60 moderate forces and train them to fight the bad guys. We did not do well in that effort. I was shocked when",1

The story: A 15-year old female from California's Central Coast is accused of throwing her infant child into the Pacific Ocean for fun. The incident occurred over the weekend, but it's not yet known if the infant is dead or alive. Her daughter will no doubt be in a different state from her parent by this time next week.

Some speculate the baby is already dead, as the child's heart was stopped, and her neck bent and neck bowed in an apparent suicide attempt. The mother has been formally charged with neglect causing death, but it's not yet known if she's charged with involuntary manslaughter (an attempted homicide committed with a child who was born premature or born without a heartbeat or breathing).

Crocodile laughter is a very funny thing. It's often used for humor when two or more people are involved, and when it's a joke or a bit of light hearted humor, there's a lot of humor in it:

And, like all the other things funny and innocent about us in our world, it sometimes causes people problems:

A 17-year-old girl from New Mexico was charged with two counts of child cruelty due to her conduct toward 5-month-old twins who died after being left on a table at a Las Vegas restaurant:

The case is still being handled by the Nevada State Department of Developmental Services and the investigation into this incident, which took place in the Las Vegas area in the early hours of July 16th. In an update posted on their site, they wrote that in the case of the two deaths, the two babies died of drowning — but, apparently not from drowning themselves. In that case, there were two adults with the infant, and the mother was charged with neglect causing death. The case is still awaiting an official autopsy, but a few other strange things",1
"State Polls: Trump Gains DRAMATICALLY | Daily Wire — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 31, 2016 Remington Research's summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become ""increasingly competitive"": Last week, we found a presidential race where Hillary Clinton held a clear advantage. This week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go.  At this pace, Hillary Clinton will likely gain at least one more point in the next few days and within days could easily win the race. In essence, if Hillary Clinton does well, we will continue to see a very competitive campaign as she heads toward election day. — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 31, 2016 Remington Research's summary of all the polling data for Tuesday: Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders has a substantial advantage among voters under 50 years old. This suggests that Democrats will continue to dominate in the primary process. — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 31, 2016 Remington Research's summary of the polling data in the last five days: If Hillary Clinton wins New Hampshire, she has won the primary in all 50 states. If Hillary Clinton wins Iowa, she has won the most recent contest in the Democratic race. If she wins New Hampshire, it could be the most important contest of the cycle — if Bernie Sanders can pull off an upset in the Granite State and make history by becoming the first socialist presidential nominee ever, it would be historic. If Hillary Clinton wins Iowa, she has to do well in Nevada, Colorado, Maine, Rhode Island, and Connecticut; however, we have no idea if either of these wins are remotely within the margins of possibility. — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 31, 2016 As of this writing— just two days into the Democratic primary— there is nearly no difference between Clinton and Bernie Sanders in the final delegate count from Iowa. What is that? According to Remington Research's latest polling data, Bernie Sanders is ahead by just 1 percentage point:

But Remington Research's analysis of all the polling data from five days before the Iowa caucus concludes that Hillary Clinton is already closing in on her Democratic opponent's lead…

The final delegate count is in — Bernie Sanders is leading the Democratic field by as much as 1 percentage point in national polling, according to Remington Research's most recent polling from five days before the Iowa caucus. This would be a landslide victory for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 31, 2016

Remington Research's analysis of all three national polls, including this particular survey, indicates Bernie Sanders is leading by less than 1/3:

This final count (according to those three national polls) doesn't include the two delegate-rich contests in Wisconsin and Michigan that remain undecided. But it certainly means Bernie Sanders is running a far better campaign than his numbers suggest. For his part, Clinton",1
" Planned Parenthood Slams Republicans For Pretending To Be Shocked By Trump’s Abortion Stance When the story broke on Wednesday about Donald Trump saying women should be punished for getting an abortion, I was, honestly, confused by the outrage. People were talking like no one has ever been so far off the deep end. As if punishing women for having an abortion wasn t inged with anti-woman ideology, as if we don't all hate women for having abortions.

The outrage isn't surprising to me. People have a lot of problems with abortion, including rape, domestic abuse, and trafficking. I think anti-choice women, especially those who would put themselves above the law if it were on one hand, will be deeply offended by the idea of having one. I wish those people would just shut up.

But because that's exactly the reaction that you heard, in response to the story and in response to Trump's comments about women, you get the most ridiculous thing in the world. When you have an absolute asshole running a political campaign talking about punishing women for having abortions, I think that really demonstrates the anti-abortion movement to its core. We're talking about a candidate for the presidency—the son of Bill Clinton—and if there's anyone we can blame for being the anti-woman movement for the past 40 years, it's Bill.

You don't have to think that the anti-choice movement is all about Trump.

We've got all the guys, and you know what else is good? That's okay! Because I don't care what kind of man Trump is (which is, I guess, a good thing, like I said, I like all types of men), I just want a president like Bill Clinton.

How did the anti-abortion movement react to Trump's comments?

The thing is: The anti-choice movement has really been saying this for a long time (this is the first time that someone has mentioned it since 2005). We said it's all about the money, all about the politics, and that we've never had access to safe and legal abortions for so long. Now the pro-life movement is taking it even more seriously. The argument is almost always: we can't have safe and legal abortion if we're going to have a war. We have to send people in to kill people because that's the only way to bring down the economy. And if women are going to lose access to abortion, we know they have a war to fight, no matter how the president of the United States gets elected.

" BUSTED: Steel Unions FURIOUS At Trump For Destroying American Jobs If Trump wants to win the rust belt, he needs to practice what he preaches. After promising multiple times that under his Administration that jobs and business would be brought back to the steelworkers of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Minnesota, a new report detailed that Trump wasn t doing his part .

The report from the AFL-CIO showed that, since the Great Recession, business is the worst of any industrial sector across the country. That includes manufacturing as well as the construction industry. Business and production have dropped from $100 billion a year to $30 billion, and the manufacturing industry's share of total US economic growth has dropped from 32 percent to just 9.7 percent—according to a report released Monday from The Heritage Foundation.

What is worse is that the report highlighted that Trump promised to bring down the nation's manufacturing workforce by 5 million workers over the next decade—but he has delivered so far only modest gains.

These two new reports are just the best examples of Trump's failure to put manufacturing back to work. He could at least bring jobs back to Ohio.

Trump is also getting flack for not putting construction back to a jobs train, and also for not doing the same to manufacturing.

What we need, as Americans, to do as a country, is get serious and get out of the manufactured economy in its tracks. In America, manufacturing is back in the saddle, but with some major reforms and a lot of focus on jobs, the manufacturing economy could and should come back to life.

So, while we focus on what we want in the world—including making America strong again—we also need to get this economy moving back into business once again.

Harry

Severus Snape[19] was a Slytherin who went on to become James's favorite teacher.

Biography

In 1582, Severus Snape was a student at Hogwarts who had a crush on Lily Evans-Verres[2] after he discovered she was an avid sports fan and also liked to read the Muggle-oriented newspapers. When Sirius Black's murder sent him into a rage, the Slytherin turned his attention to his nemesis, but was betrayed by Harry Potter. After Harry's discovery, he had Snape, an aloof and stoic man, teach him some basic magical skills while he took care of his own students.[2] Harry became an early mentor with regard to his education and Severus was impressed",1
"SENILITY OR TRUTH BOMB? Bill Clinton To Crowd: “Sometimes I Wish We weren’t married” [VIDEO] It s probably just a big misunderstanding. Bill likely misspoke kinda like, I did not have sexual relations with that woman.  The person in question was not pregnant, but the issue is was he, the baby, or not. It is the baby. He is innocent. It is not, in any way, a ""sexual relationship"" between two people. The person was pregnant and there is no chance he would go into labor with the baby. The baby died in the morning, there is no chance he would have an abortion. I think this might have been a mistake that Bill made. He just went with it. We are not saying he is innocent of these charges, just that there is no chance he would have abortion again. He would have had to get legal permission from the authorities to get his children back, if he wanted to. So yeah, this is a legal issue at this point.

Q: Was Bill's behavior in the car with the girl when he met her anything but what's expected of a 19 year old teen?

A: Bill got angry. He's 17 and in high school. His behavior was not what you would expect a 19 year old, I guess, to be, especially around a woman. He said she needed to be on welfare. He's not sure that he is supposed to even think about getting her pregnant and then having a sexual relationship with her (she didn't know that she was pregnant at the time) but his attitude was that she was not ""attractive enough"" enough on her own. He called her a prostitute, and that is typical behavior. He was also not cool enough with having sex with her at the bus stop at night, even though she said repeatedly ""no.""

Q: After the incident she went to the hospital. What happened?

A: She passed out from the effects of the drugs she consumed the night before. She passed out on her stomach and died within 24 hours. It was really hard on everyone and she was lucky she had the support of her parents (who lived close by).

Q: Is he still going after her?

A: We will have to wait and see. We really hope he doesn't go after her again, especially while he was in college. We believe now, especially since no criminal charges have been formally filed, that the situation would have been resolved differently if he had not had a hard time talking to this girl and to this other woman. We will continue to hold Bill accountable as we do every other case because it didn t fit any of the traditional criteria for someone to be arrested, charged or convicted.",1

" Overnight Las Vegas Attack Is Deadliest Mass Shooting In American History (DETAILS) Sunday night at the Route 91 Harvest Festival 2017, two unknown shooters began gunning down police officers and at least one bodyguard from what appeared to be the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas.The country music festival was just concluding for the weekend, with the last  band playing when about one hundred attendees were gunned down. But what happened was so horrific that it inspired its own hashtag, which has since been set on Twitter: #UniteTheRight.Laszlo Zlochi reports on the aftermath in Nevada - where law enforcement has reported more than 100 gun battles in a 48-hour span after the shootings. (Published Thursday, Aug. 3, 2017)

The first was the gunman who opened fire late Wednesday night in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 people and wounding 19 others, including the wife of another shooter, before turning the massacre on himself.

By early Friday morning, the second dead gunman had been released. An unidentified gunman killed at least five officers near the Las Vegas Strip and near the popular festival-site in Las Vegas, police said. One other person is dead, according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police.

The motive for the two shooters, including the woman who survived with critical injuries, is unclear; police have yet to announce what those motives are or whether they were terrorism-related. In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, the White House called for ""a coordinated and comprehensive assault against ISIS. Our military should be engaged in every corner of this globe. … But it never should be allowed to define an entire community or define our nation.""

President Donald Trump echoed the sentiment in a Thursday afternoon tweet announcing that ""we must NEVER allow ISIS to return, and we must defeat ISIS and other terrorist organizations that threaten the West. We will prevail!""

"French Plan for ‘Mega Database’ of Citizens’ Personal Data Triggers Protests November 11, 2016 French Plan for ‘Mega Database’ of Citizens’ Personal Data Triggers Protests The French government is under fire for quietly issuing a decree establishing a mega-database of personal details of 60 million French citizens, a move privacy campaigners view as potentially dangerous. The database established by the decree  will have a database of personal information including name, address and other details. France's highest court recently approved the document, allowing the national privacy watchdog the power to create such a database. In February, however, the country's highest administrative court ruled that the public has a right to review the terms of the decree as long as they can challenge the ""undemocratic and arbitrary"" nature of the data breach, and to seek judicial reviews of the data it contains. The database has already been distributed across the country, and it is now subject to a legal challenge by the activist group called 'Dossiers', who have accused a group of French officials of deliberately overstepping their authority. The database is designed to keep track of all details – names, photos, emails – of individuals as they go from job opening to application form to job application, and to track movements of their personal data from one system to another as well as to monitor the data being collected through their electronic devices. It will also have the capacity to analyze the data when it is transferred or stored, as citizens' interests in security are being protected under the laws of the European Union – the UK, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France. The French government has made no attempt to hide its intention to use the data, with the deputy minister for state for data protection and privacy who approved the decree stating in a speech to parliament that it is ""part of the mission which France, because of the unique situation and the state of our democracy intends to fulfill"". The data breach will affect only those aged 18 and over, and is only the fifth database breach to be revealed through a law in over a decade, according to data firm Deloitte. It was also revealed that as many as a third of the personal data in the database is unencrypted. In August, a French court ruled that a citizen could sue Facebook and its subsidiaries for revealing his e-mail address and photo, calling the revelations ""dangerous"" and ""ill-advised"". This week, the court has agreed that the data breaches are a breach of privacy, and will hear a class action against Facebook.

In January, the German data protection authorities announced that they were examining concerns from the American public about data-minidiscrimination procedures offered by their companies, including Google. The German Federal Office for Information Security notified French and American companies, and said there would be an independent process of investigation, and that it will publish a draft law to deal with these issues by December 2017.

" Hilarious Rare Video Shows How Hillary Prepared To Avoid A Trump Hug By now, we re all aware of how Donald Trump repeatedly humiliates the nation with his handshake games. He awkwardly tugs people in some kind of attempted power play, holds on to their hands for far too long, and, in the most inhospitable move of all, attempts to give them  an actual handshake at some point in order to show his own strength.

As if it were no big deal to him.

But if you are like me, and this has been going on for some time, then this might be just what you need.

I'm here to let you know that it's not what you're doing that's embarrassing but what your actions are doing. It's as simple as that right here.

We all need to take a look at our own hands as well. It's no surprise then that we tend to have more gripes.

Do us all a favor and think about how to improve your hand to make the handshake experience even more enjoyable. A good tip is to give those of us with naturally stronger hands a warm handshake each day (this isn't much different than giving it to you by giving your thumbs a shake), so that we, the fans, can all get to know how the president's hands work on the golf course.

And after that?

Let's give it to his administration! We've got a month to go!

Do you want the president to look like a better leader? If so, then I challenge you to make the handshake experience even better (yes, really).

Have at it man!

Now, when this President has taken the opportunity to talk to his wife, there are certain topics he is allowed to get caught up in that he should have done before. However, on those specific days, one can't tell if he was serious and was actually joking with the press or if it was genuine. So he made the very right thing to show his true worth. And he should have done it the day he was sworn in to the presidency…

[Via Fox News, The Hill and Fox Business]

And to those who doubt that Trump's behavior really does look more or less like a human handshake (I know my sister's mother can say ""that one"") I say this:

This president isn't just a human, he's a human being. To everyone I've spoken to, I've seen the president's hands as he moves around Trump Tower, meeting with business figures — some with whom he seems quite cozy — and even being a little bit friendly toward his wife, Melania.

So let me say this: Don't take my word for it but listen to us. Donald Trump is, indeed, a human being.

"Assange: Clinton Campaign Tried To Hack WikiLeaks Edmondo Burr in News , World // 0 Comments Julian Assange claims that Hillary Clinton’s campaign used hackers to attack WikiLeaks’ servers. WikiLeaks’ editor-in-chief says that despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down its internet to stop accusations of interference in U.S. elections, his organisation will keep on publishing until the  U.S. government decides to extradite him. A statement released by the organisation says that Wikileaks will continue publishing until Clinton’s campaign does.

WikiLeaks releases an alleged email that says one of the key figures in the Clinton campaign, Sidney Blumenthal ‑– who is also reported to have been associated with her campaign staff‒ wrote a piece about the issue for The Atlantic, ""There's Always Room for Improvement."" (WikiLeaks had tweeted that it was the first such editorial in the company's archive, with the article appearing on Oct. 14, 2015.) The message included a draft of a column and Blumenthal's personal email address.

The exchange, written as Blumenthal noted he had been in contact with Assange himself, did not appear in print before the Intercept reported it on Oct. 22, 2015. A copy of the memo, provided to the Intercept by Blumenthal and published on Oct. 29, 2015, was provided by WikiLeaks to the public on Oct. 31.

It included the following line, which Assange said he had not seen before.

While the most recent of Trump's proposed judicial appointments to the Supreme Court would likely be conservative justice Antonin Scalia, not everyone is buying it; in fact, a group of more than 200 prominent Republicans have called on the incoming president to withdraw his nomination of conservative justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

While Trump has been publicly lambasting President Obama for his nomination of Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for the past nine years, he has failed to come out in support of the appointment of an openly gay man. On Friday, he reportedly told conservative talk show host Maria Bartiromo that his first choice for Supreme Court justice should not be an openly gay man since it would be ""embarrassing the Court."" Trump's comments suggest that the incoming president will not be able to keep his promise about his support for LGBT rights for this term.

The Republican Party is deeply divided on the issue of the right to LGBT equality, with some Republicans citing the importance of marriage as a cornerstone of the institution while others maintain that same-sex relationships should not be recognized as marriages in order to preserve the value of the institution.

And with the advent of WordPress 2.7+, I feel as though WordPress isn't really going anywhere.

So I thought I should share with you 2 articles I would like to see WordPress.org get around to getting around to updating to WordPress 3.0, along with some improvements on my own.

1. WordPress 2.1.1's Content Controls Are Not Worthy of a Place – Part 2

I recently upgraded from PHP 6 to PHP 7 (because I love WordPress), and I noticed that on both the home page and login page of each page there were some very minor tweaks. I'll call out one that would definitely make an impression on any user trying the site: they now have a place for a menu option for the WordPress admin tools. I know it can't be as powerful as the ""Settings"" menu, to be honest. However, for some users it's a very important option.

And for me, the whole time I was using WordPress, that's how I'd like to go about having my settings as well. I should know, just like it sounds – some of these settings are very valuable for someone with a technical bent like me. But they're not the ones that should be around.

So you can see from where the WordPress.org page is now with the ""Settings"" menu item, it shows that you now have the option (with a few possible tweaks) to have a more advanced and flexible settings panel that allows you to define options based on custom data. So basically you could even have something like this (which should be just fine for me with other options):

It'd probably be a great addition to WordPress. Or at least the right one for me. But the ""Settings"" menu item still has very minor improvements as well, as the code to get this feature is already present in the base WordPress",1
"The Chronovisor: A Device Used To Look Into The Future And Past 1 Reply According to numerous reports and stories that have been published through the years, among the many alleged secrets the Vatican has, there is a device called the Chronovisor. The device enables its user to observe future as well as past events. Many believe this device is one of  the hidden codes, the 'cure for the satanic culture' of the Vatican and its surrounding culture, and is even theorized to be hidden as a secret by the Holy See and even some within other religions.

In some people's opinion, they believe that an ancient Egyptian or Babylonian secret message known as YHWH's message from Egypt, in its form a secret cipher message that contains a coded message containing the message of another Egyptian or Babylonian secret message of the 'Curse of Egypt,' and that a hidden code, coded code, hidden code or secret message is that of this curse. One of the secrets that are said to lie buried within, a code of which is the Holy Grail, that the Grail represents is a set of five secret grails of which one which is the code of that world. It is stated that there are five grails, which are represented within the secret grail. The Five grails are the Golden Fleece, the Silver Fleece, the Green Fleece and the Bronze Fleece, and each one of the grails has a role of its own and it would be an understatement to say that the most interesting to those dedicated to esoteric study in this spiritual realm has to be the Bronze Fleece which contains the 'God of Gold.'

The Golden Fleece (also known as the Golden Haunter or the Golden Fleece Code code, a code whose meaning is unknown to the average reader, unless the individual can decipher a written letter, this code is only the last part of which is revealed when the codes are deciphered by someone with a high level intelligence.


This code, the codes of which vary according to how powerful one is, and as we have already talked about previously, each is associated with a ritual, and most likely with something of sacred significance, and the golden fleece is the code that is associated with one.


In Greek mythology (especially in The Iliad), it is said that the fane in which the Golden Fleece Code is held, was where the gods and the gods' daughters (the Einherjar",1
"What is Comey up to and who is he working for? Posted on October 31, 2016 by Michael Collins FBI Director James Comey. Wikimedia FBI Director James Comey’s letter to Congress on new evidence in the Clinton email scandal represents interference in the presidential campaign commensurate with his failure to indict candidate Hillary Clinton for crimes greater than those committed by  the current American administration of former President Bill Clinton. The FBI memo states Comey had ""a responsibility to inform Congress that he intends to review the new emails and to inform them of our judgment that they contain classified information,"" thus creating a conflict of interest. The letter, signed by the FBI director himself, is dated October 28 and dated October 1. However, we now know that Comey received the memo from the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility, acting Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. In his letter to Congress, Deputy Attorney General Yates stated, to the surprise of the White House and congressional leaders: ""I am writing to emphasize that the President has the authority to remove an individual from office if he or she obtains credible information that an FBI investigation, in the lead-up to election day, is being conducted in a way that is unfair to any particular candidate, election opponent, election process participant, electoral process official, candidate committee, election law user, or voter.""

On October 29th, in an email, a top Justice Department official wrote, ""So, as James Comey testified last week before Congress about his investigation into the Clinton Foundation, and as Secretary of State John Kerry said during last week's Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, there's zero evidence that the Russia investigation has been a 'witch hunt' in any way. Now we know that, as the FBI said last week, we have not made any of these same 'unprecedented inquiries into any campaign.'"" Comey's October 29, 2016 letter to Congress was a clear, clear violation of the laws designed to prevent political interference in the 2016 presidential election. In his letter to Congress, Comey argued that the FBI's actions in October are ""just to confirm what had been known"" – Hillary Clinton was the victim of an ""influence operation"" and ""taps"" – an activity by Russian spy agencies to sway U.S. elections based on the goals of the Moscow-based bank Rosneft. Clinton was not even interviewed by the FBI as a possible subject of this investigation at the time. Comey also states, ""The FBI has interviewed [Russian spy agency] FSB [Federal Security Service] agents and, based on those interviews, it is possible that they assisted in the hacking of U.S. political organizations in the course of the 2016 election,"" and the FSB is the successor to Russia's main intelligence unit. In fact, we now know that the CIA's Central Intelligence Agency was already aware of the activities of the FSB when it decided to conduct",1
"MISLEADING MAINSTREAM MEDIA Is Pushing False Narrative That Trump Electors Could Steal Election From Him …Why It’s Not Gonna Happen…And Why Their Attack On Our Democracy Is A Really BAD Idea Here is Michigan elector Michael Banerian telling about death threats that he s received over his vote for Trump on Monday.The leftist media has encouraged the (insanely impossible) idea that Trump could be defeated by the Electoral College, by using misleading headlines, like the one below from USA Today to  make this claim:In reality, Trump has a large lead over Clinton in most of the popular vote states, and the Electoral College has never voted for Obama.

I got stuck in the game and lost everything, and got no satisfaction! All of my progress was lost in an unresponsive and nonfunctional game, and I'm not even a big fan of a game in its current form :(


I tried to use this as an excuse, but honestly, this would've been a much better game with a more engaging story and a longer ending, especially for those who have already tried the game. I wish I would've done some other things to complete this and put better game mechanics around it for that. I played the game, but don't believe I could have possibly done well considering how difficult every aspect is and what we got out of the game.


I'm looking into getting an update to the game to get it back up to what it might be like playing at all, like it needs some kind of optimization to be fun again, but for now, this is too frustrating to play.<|endoftext|>What a difference a year makes. For the 2014-15 season, NHL.com offers its predictions for the league. Based on those pre-season projections, which took into account the results of each of its 13 regular-season games, we present our top 12 picks to go with the predictions of our preseason panel.

(For more, see our post-season predictions.)

What does it mean for this preseason?

Here are five things to look for as our playoff projections get closer to actual events next year.

Prediction: St. Louis Blues win the draft lottery, getting a first-round pick, and a fourth-overall pick to play for. The Blues will be lucky to miss the playoffs with a lottery-like outcome. The odds of being drafted at number one on Monday morning — assuming the Blues can pull off the upset of their first round — are in the low 60s to 90 percent. If the Blues can win out, they'll become the only team from that spot (the Rangers) to miss the playoffs for more than a decade.

"WHY IS AL SHARPTON’S “Half-Brother” Registering Thousands Of Felons To Vote In Alabama’s Controversial Senate Race? [VIDEO] Pastor Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow claims he s Reverend Al Sharpton s brother, and he s registering thousands of felons to vote in the hotly contested, upcoming Senate election. When the local News 5 station looked into the pastor s claim, that he was Al Sharpton s brother, they made an  assumption and told the public it was not the case

Mr Sharpton claims he s brother is registered to vote through his business, Rev Al Sharpton s Justice Party. He says Rev Sharpton s party wants to ""turn back"" the country s constitutional clock with their policies that make the government bigger and richer.

A spokeswoman for the Reverend Sharpton's Justice Party said Mr Sharpton was simply trying to make a case for why African Americans should not be able vote in Georgia elections in a lawsuit filed this week. He claims voting has been wrongfully suppressed and believes he s fighting for the right of all Americans to vote.

They were talking when they were assaulted by the guy that stole his pet dog. His name is Yousuf, and he also took my cat Babu. A little while after the attack, they had a fight to see who gets Babu back. The fight escalated, and Roxy was beaten so badly that she couldn't walk. They threw Roxy in the lake in front of all the people, and went back to their house where they were hiding until they had left. There, they met up with Babu, who was still wearing his pants. Babu told them the whole story, like how he took the cat for a ride from house to house and that he wouldn t pay the ransom for Roxy without having to go through legal wrangling and getting justice. The people who stole the cat were called into the police station along with their lawyer, who told the guys that the victim and baby girl were being framed by their captors and that there a lot of innocent people involved in the theft, although they were just innocent cats that just wanted a friendly and affectionate pet to keep them company. The police officers and prosecutors are saying that the whole thing was organized with the help of the local mosque leader, Babu, because all the mosques in the area where the attacks took place were trying to protect these two innocent souls. It appears that Babu is only happy that the police are saying little in the case where it looks like they are trying to be nice to innocent victims.<|endoftext|>LAST week I got to see a new piece of music on one of the new record labels I support called Black Eyed Peas.

" This Sheriff Has Threatened To Arrest The CEO Of Apple For Protecting Your Privacy (VIDEO) Apple s fight against the FBI on behalf of the privacy rights of their customers has taken a chilling turn, with law enforcement officers openly threatening to arrest CEO Tim Cook personally if his company denies their requests.Grady Judd, Sheriff of Polk County Florida, issued a threat of arrest to  Cook yesterday during an emergency meeting with federal law enforcement officials at the sheriff's office, according to an ABC 11 report.

""If Apple fails to comply with the investigation, as soon as I make a motion in front of the judge the sheriff can go get the sheriff, if you're a citizen or you're an employee of Apple it's in front of the judge, and I guarantee you when I call Sheriff Smith there is going to be no other opportunity for your company to come back to the table and negotiate,"" Judd claimed.Cook is currently in Germany working on the next firmware update for its iPad.

"OBAMA’S CROOKED DOJ HIDES Massive Hillary Scandal: “The U.S. government spent millions of dollars, went all over the world to bankrupt him, and destroyed his life — all to protect Hillary Clinton’s crimes” The most crooked person to ever run for President The Obama administration is moving to dismiss charges against an arms dealer it had accused of selling weapons that were destined for Libyan rebels.Lawyers for the Justice Department on Monday filed a motion in federal court in Phoenix to drop the  case against Ahmed Jaber. Jaba, 43, a Lebanese citizen, pleaded guilty in 2010 in federal court to conspiracy to distribute and transfer a firearm after the government charged him in 2013 with selling U.S. guns to rebels who were later overthrown by the Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi.""When the United States Government entered the Libya conflict, it relied on assurances from several people in the Libyan State who were involved in the procurement of firearms and explosives for the rebels,"" Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in a prepared statement. ""However, government investigation revealed that these sources were not responsible for their transactions or the delivery of the weapons or explosives. They were merely facilitators.""Since Mr. Jaber first was prosecuted in 2010, the Justice Department has been trying to determine whether his sales of arms to the rebels were criminal.""We are disappointed that, despite numerous and consistent assertions by various entities, the United States has not concluded that this case is consistent with international law or that it was ever prosecuted to this degree,"" Ms. Caldwell said. ""Unfortunately, this case is not an isolated example of an alleged trafficking scheme and underscores how difficult it is for law enforcement to track down, arrest, and prosecute individuals who are involved in unlawful activities overseas.""The department declined to comment further on the case.Mr. Jaber was indicted in 2013 on four counts including conspiracy to distribute and transfer a firearm. He pleaded guilty in August 2014 to the charges after accepting a plea deal requiring him to forfeit $5 million in assets from his bank account with the British firm HBOS.Mr. Jaber was one of several defendants the DOJ is charging with funneling arms to Libyan rebels in 2013 before the Libyan crisis, after a Justice Department investigation concluded that he had sold dozens of high-powered rifles.The defense's motion comes weeks before Mr. Jaber is set to travel to the United States to appear before the House Criminal and Civil Rights Committee.<|endoftext|>BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Orioles, despite struggling in the postseason, made a late splash in a deal for center fielder Lorenzo Cain.

" Donald Trump Was Looking To Build A Trump Tower In Moscow While He Was Running For President As you would be more than aware, contacts between high-ranking and lower-level Trump aides and Russians have emerged in recent months and, as a result of these talks, a new story is coming to light; that Donald Trump s businesses were trying to seal a deal on building an enormous  Trump International Hotel in Moscow while it was still on the drawingboard.

The New York Times says in their report that, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions, the Trump Organization and the Kremlin were in talks over a proposal for the purchase of 12 towers in Moscow's Red Square, which would cover five square blocks and encompass more than 2 million square feet of business spaces. The Times cites one person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It could not confirm these details as of this writing and there is no way to verify that this report is accurate.

The New York Times story states that Moscow has long sought to establish itself as a top financial center of eastern Europe, a desire that began with Vladimir Putin being granted control of two Russian banks with significant American backing. The United States, however, has not been willing to allow Russian interests to take over any property the U.S. government owned in the region. The report adds that the Kremlin has been in a position to provide American companies with billions of dollars of direct assistance by offering them loans.

While Russia has taken advantage of U.S. financial cooperation in other key areas, including its relationship with European banks and trade agreements, the United States, however, has not been willing to provide Russia with the kind of military weaponry and infrastructure built by the Soviet Union to compete with Putin's vast and ambitious economy and its modern nuclear arsenal.

The Times article also stated that the Trump Organization was in the planning stages to move its headquarters into Moscow by late 2016. This move would potentially place a significant dent in the company's ability to open new retail stores and to improve the bottom line and reputation of its hotel chain. The Times also says that Trump has refused the ""federal government."" However, the source told the paper he does not believe Trump has made a binding decision about the issue.

The Times reported that the proposed arrangement with Trump would be in direct competition with the Trump brand, a statement they would cite as a major red line for Russia, one that has long been raised when it comes to the American brand. The Times cited a new report in the Russian-Canadian business daily newspaper Izvestia that claimed that Trump will not sign a deal for Russia to buy his brand. The report cited this source as saying that Trump could sell off his stake in his name to others.

The Times says that according to government information, ""Trump was already on the short list to become the world's first global property owner, but his offer was rejected in",1
" Donald Trump Jr. Blames Scalise Shooting On ‘Caesar’ Actors And Gets WRECKED (TWEETS) If Republicans were even moderately literate, they would know that the message of Shakespeare s Julius Caesar is that assassinating leaders you don t like is just bad juju all around. Everyone ends up unhappy in the end. Enter Donald Trump Jr, stage far-Right.Shortly after the guy who shot GOP  Senator Jeff Sessions for what he says were insufficiently harsh comments about immigration got elected President, Trump Jr tweeted , ""I've been asked many times about Hillary . I've heard her say many bad things. She has no intention of ever running for office. Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the Second Amendment. And if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,"" and then he offered this, ""When a person says something negative about us — without evidence — I say, 'You can be ASHAMED OF US. You have no business even BEING President. Go to hell. We will defend the Constitution wherever you find us.' I love our Second Amendment.""But then Trump Jr says this, ""It has no effect on my campaign."" Trump Jr is essentially saying that any criticism of his father is a valid, legitimate point of reference. If he and his people think that criticism of his father isn't legitimate or relevant, how can anyone think it is? His daughter, it must be said, is smart enough to realize that her father doesn t have to have anything to do with these things.But, again, if Republicans were serious about the Second Amendment, they'd understand this and know that when Trump Jr tells the world he thinks Hillary wants ""abolish"" anything, that is one way to shut down his entire political career. The second and bigger example would be President Barack Obama saying he didn t buy Hillary's lie about her health care plan, which is the ultimate lie. I'm not suggesting he didn t know that. I'm suggesting he wasn t aware of this, because it is a lie. But he is aware of it, because he is the president, so he must have known. If he weren t aware of it, he wouldn t have to tell the world such a ridiculous lie, or else the lie wouldn't have been the first point made by a president during the election campaign.Trump Jr., being the kind of person who thinks the truth is in the eye of the beholder, apparently doesn't think that any lie is more true than the lie of having an opponent who wants it, and so he has chosen to lie. But if he weren t aware that people might take that as his own truth and therefore have more credibility than everyone else, he might have had no reason to tell the truth at all.<|endoftext|>You are welcome to take questions about this blog from visitors you have written to this page.

" Trump Staffers Admit Their Boss Has No Idea What DACA Is Donald Trump sent a racist elf to make the announcement that his administration is going to punish 800,000 young people, who came to the U.S. as children, and subject them to deportation in an act that Attorney General Jeff Sessions called compassionate. The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program,  created to protect young people from deportation, was recently terminated by the Trump Justice Department.

And, despite his repeated promises to create a ""deportation force"" to deal with the so-called so-called ""bad hombres,"" Trump has also threatened to build a wall separating Mexico, which he has called the ""worst country in the world"" for people living there.

Trump also told the Associated Press that he is willing to consider removing people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, even if some may find work in an alternative country that welcomes them to the U.S.

Trump also made the announcement during a Thursday morning phone and Twitter video call.

""We're going to start building for one, big, great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for that wall; it will be built quickly and we will have Mexico pay for that wall very, very inexpensively,"" Trump said on a conference call with reporters and Mexican officials. ""Now the question is, and let me just say it, but I'm not saying it, we also have to come to terms on terms with other countries,"" but didn't elaborate, he said.

""We can't let illegal immigration continue,"" Trump said. ""We have to secure our border, we have to round up and detain and put them right back.""

The Kenyan parliament will vote this week on a bill giving doctors unprecedented immunity from prosecution if they perform abortions without informing their patients.

Kenya's pro-life movement has claimed the measure is a step towards giving women the legal right to terminate their pregnancies even if they carry live-born children.

Ministers say clinics providing safe abortions will suffer financial losses.

The Health Ministry has defended the legislation saying that it will save lives and will make it easier for women to end their pregnancies.

The bill's text is not yet final but it was obtained by the BBC behind closed doors following a third year of investigation into allegations of violence against abortion clinics and women seeking safe abortions in Kenya.

" Donald Trump Just Posted A BRUTAL Video That Shows How Much Everyone Hates Ted Cruz (VIDEO) Maybe this is Republican front-runner Donald Trump s strange way of celebrating April Fool s Day or maybe he s just being his normal, childish self, but The Donald has just posted a pretty hilarious video that boasts the fact that his GOP rival, Texas senator Ted Cruz, is highly , highly qualified to serve as president.

In the video, a voiceover over proclaims that ""Ted Cruz is well-qualified to be the 45th President of the United States of America. He is the most qualified, most experienced, and most experienced person to serve as President of the United States."" In other words, Cruz has just earned the right to be President, as anyone who has ever served in office knows.

In case you missed it, in the video above, Cruz gives us a list of the top 12 reasons Cruz is ""the most qualified"" to be President.

To put it simply, Cruz has spent his early years in private school and he has lived a ""very successful"" life. And if all that comes as a big surprise to voters, the video also states that Cruz is a ""strong Christian"" and that he has ""an impeccable track record of integrity from a religious perspective and in other areas. I am not a perfect person, he is, but to be a strong Christian and to be a successful one, I have spent my time in private schools."" That, it seems to me, has to count here. If you look at it that way, it's not like Cruz is someone who is really just someone who says, ""Hey, I'm a Christian and I love Jesus."" It's not like he's a devout Christian. At very least, he may not be one.

In the following passage, Cruz actually does speak about this.

The point I'm making with this is that I'm a very conservative Christian. I believe I'm one of the strongest Christian right people alive. I love to tell people, ""Oh, that means a lot to me when I get home. You're a conservative and I'll protect you from things that don't have any basis in fact. You're a strong Christian and you've lived a very successful life. You're a conservative, and I will protect you from things that I don't agree with because they don't have any basis in fact. We have people like Barack Obama saying what they want to say because they love it and they get more support from people who disagree with them, and that's what we need in this country. The fact that I say these things, I don't mean they are right. I'm actually a very conservative Christian, and I believe in the principles that I think we need out there, especially in this country.

Cruz then says that ""I believe a person needs",1
"Can Kenya lead the African Union? Tweet Widget by Horace G. Campbell From championing impunity for suspected masterminds of crimes against humanity, to frustrating African liberation and unity by working in cahoots with Empire; from publicly supporting Israel's desire to join the African Union, to being a conduit for illicit financial flows from Africa; Kenya is  in the middle of this. And we haven't even gone to the top. All of this was documented in the 2011 BBC documentary, Black Sheep, a report that also found that Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, a member of the ruling party, the party of Nelson Mandela, had an interest in ""developing the lucrative arms business on the West African shores"". The report was subsequently leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). It reveals details of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of illicit financial transactions by African governments, which have enabled Kenyan President Kenyatta to buy and sell arms through his trusted close associate, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in exchange for votes and influence in his country. Kenyatta is also said to have used his position to solicit loans from Western banks and corporations in return for his support for African projects, such as the Nairobi Expo that ran from January to August 2009.

The fact that President Obama supported these deals, a number of them were facilitated by African governments and Western banks, is hardly surprising. While he did call for a closer partnership with both African nations – from a position of solidarity – it is clear that he still has a significant distance to go in understanding the real power players behind this covert business of financial theft from Africa – for which he appears to think it is only fair to support their interests. His willingness to support the Kenyan government (even when this has resulted in a brutal campaign of terrorism), as a signer of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), a treaty that seeks to strengthen American anti-corruption efforts in the European Union (Eu), and even as a staunch advocate for Israel's entry into the African Union, are proof enough that his actions have the potential to further undermine African civil society.

To be clear, I am not suggesting that those in charge of the Obama administration knew exactly what they were doing or that they had any desire to change their course of action.

I am simply asking those in charge of these programs, and those who advise the administration, to take some sort of stand – a stance that suggests they know – when a policy or a practice is working – for themselves, for the interests of their close personal friends, and for those of Western countries who are directly involved in the ongoing criminal activities.

For those of you who want to know more and see an example of the type of policy in question – from the recent US decision to give immunity to drug pushers involved in",1
"MARINE CORPS GENERAL WARNS U.S. TROOPS: “There’s A War Coming” While the mainstream media remains transfixed on a phony Trump-Russian collusion story, they completely ignore the real news, about how things appear to be heating up between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the U.S.A Marine Corps commandant on Thursday warned U.S. troops stationed in Norway to be prepared for a  Russian military aggression.

At a meeting with officials, Rear Admiral Mike Condon of the U.S. Marine Corps warned that Russia would attempt to take advantage of the ongoing NATO-Russia peace summit in Warsaw, Poland. He added that he fears the ""very real possibility"" that a Russian aggression will prompt a U.S. nuclear strike.

The meeting — which he also called a ""day in the life"" of American troops in Norway — took place in the United States. The meeting was also attended by three other senior members of the Marine Corps, three of whom said they were considering an immediate deployment to a U.S. base in the Arctic.

According to the military service academy's website, Condon serves as Commandant of Marine Corps Expeditionary Combat Center (MARCOM) Washington, D.C. and was previously head of Washington DC's nuclear deterrent. ""I can't tell you what this means for any of you coming back.""

Condon said a ""vast majority"" of his Marine Corps colleagues are ""very concerned"" with what happens next to their troops stationed in Norway. During Condon's recent visit to Europe, he informed the Russian government that ""we are in the final stages of a dangerous military response to Russia, and I am concerned that we will be confronted with a Russian attack in a matter of days or weeks.""

In addition, he stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""very concerned"" that the current situation ""in Norway … will bring a retaliatory Russian military response.""

It has become increasingly clear that the U.S. political scene was ""in tatters"" following the election of Donald Trump, with various political figures, especially Republicans, claiming they did not vote for Trump because ""he was a bad deal for Russia."" In reality, ""I will tell you that his [Republican] base will thank me for it.""

Condon was one of some high-ranking U.S. military officials who were also reportedly very concerned when Putin did not back down from the planned bombing of Syria despite Trump's repeated calls for doing so. In an October 25 letter to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, General James Mattis advised the top Russian diplomat that Russia must understand that ""there is enormous force behind the Syrian threat now,"" and that such an attack would be met with severe consequences. Mattis suggested that the Russians should refrain from attempting to escalate the situation to the level that it has so far.

This week, Trump himself threatened a ""fire",1
" Wikileaks Admits To Screwing Up IMMENSELY With Twitter Poll On Hillary’s Health Wikileaks, which is more a conspiracy enterprise than it is a whistleblowing watchdog these days, put up a poll on Twitter that asked users to tell them which health issue they thought was causing Hillary s coughing fits and unusual body movements. All four of their answers have been bandied  about as some sort of health threat for Clinton: blood clots, dehydration and the flu.

In contrast — aside from the question of which issue is causing her so many, not her cough — Clinton received less than a third of the two-thirds of the online audience she had at her previous debate. Hillary won over 1.55 million Twitter users but just 1.16 million Facebook followers. Clinton only got nearly 5 percent of the Facebook audience but got nearly 2.9 million Twitter followers. It's worth noting the second half of the polls aren't based on actual actual votes but were rather based on how big Clinton's Twitter following is. One Clinton campaign official told Fox News one of their hopes is that as more people watch, the ""debate"" takes off, perhaps driving viewers to the debates more often.

In the end, it's a pretty sad outcome for anyone who wants Hillary to actually perform this well: Clinton can't possibly win the Presidency unless her ""faulty"" email server gets an overhaul, someone leaks her tax returns, she gets outfoxed by a crazy racist bigot with a long history of mental illness who has had his own racist rhetoric, or her campaign collapses. This isn't exactly the greatest victory of all time either. It's even worse considering what sort of damage she could probably just take care of in the next few weeks on that server and other issues.

She's got a hell of a lot to deal with, you understand.

Ruth Leonnig is director of public policy and communication at the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).

""We all want people to be healthy, but there is also this issue of whether we can make it legal and countable. So now they have to decide whether to join in by getting prescriptions for their medication or whether to go out with a supply of the substance from another state.""

The debate over marijuana legalization in Colorado is heating up after this week's election of Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Udall as Colorado's next governor—with the state enjoying recreational marijuana use for the first time.

Under the Colorado legalization initiative, the medical use of marijuana would be regulated and taxed for adult purposes, regardless of the quantity of marijuana consumed, with no criminal penalties, the Washington Post reports.

" Conservative Texas Lt. Governor Tweets Vile Bible Verse After Mass Shooting In LGBT Club Conservatives are already praising God for the murder of 20 or more people at an LGBT night club in Orlando, Florida.On Saturday night, a gunman walked into the club with an assault rifle and began shooting people. So far, at least 20 are confirmed dead but police say the death  toll is likely to rise. ""It doesn't matter what happens in the future, this was the right thing to do,"" President Donald Trump tweeted shortly after the deadliest massacre in U.S. history took place.

I didn't understand what he was trying to do. #ISIS #Sommerville — Josh Sestre (@JoshSestre) June 12, 2017

After he was elected, Trump was quick to blame the massacre on the ""evil"" president. ""You can call anything anything for what happened a horrible thing,"" Trump said. ""It's an evil person that did that to many innocent people. But I will tell you what, that evil person was a horrible, horrible, evil individual. It's a criminal act.""

""It's evil from what I read, he coulda just kept an eye on him,"" his daughter Ivanka said this evening.

After the shooting, Trump doubled down on his claim that the person responsible was a member of the ""alt-left,"" saying the president will take the blame for the violence.

In his campaign announcement speech Thursday night, Trump claimed that ""radical Islamic terrorists"" were going to kill the president. ""I always said I am prepared for anything, that we'll see if we can beat them. We're going to beat them all. We beat 'em, frankly,"" he said.

After the shooting, he went on to claim that Obama was not doing enough to fight the ""evil Islamic terrorists.""

""Now, when you mention the word ISIS, you've got another bad one on your hands,"" Trump said. ""And, for that matter, for that people that are killing us at the airport. I know all about it, because we have the people that are responsible for this horrible thing. They're terrible people. They're bad people. And, unfortunately, they're being given sanctuary.""

After the shooting, some media outlets picked apart his comments.

While it would be nice to believe Trump is on the side of law enforcement, one can't help but think he's been too quick to blame a political enemy for the Orlando nightclub shooting.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Orlando Police have interviewed dozens of people in connection with both the mass murder and the shooting at Pulse nightclub, including a former employee of the gay bar, the local paper reports.

""We're confident that, when and whether there is further information, we will appropriately bring charges for these individuals,""",1
"Comment on Mass Fish Deaths: Millions Have Been Found Dead All Over The World In The Past Month by Whackamole Mass Fish Deaths: Millions Have Been Found Dead All Over The World In The Past Month May 20th, 2014 Millions of fish are suddenly dying all over the planet. In fact, there have been dozens of mass fish death events reported in the past month alone. So why is this  happening? One major reason is fish that are genetically engineered to eat and survive in the toxic fishmeal, and fish that are eating so much of the nutrient-dense algae and other microorganisms that cause disease in fish, are being pushed into the water. It's not just the high levels of toxic algae. As many as 10 millions fish are dying in the western ocean right now. These include species like the Great White shark (pictured above), humpbacks, giant tuna, blue crabs and sea urchins. As these fish, which normally live in warm, shallow waters, begin to take up more of the water's surface, they're starving to death. There are thousands if not hundreds of species of fish alive today — including several types of tuna — that are suffering, as well as more than 2000 fish species. They're all being pushed into increasingly toxic water by industrial food production that has been fueled by unsustainable algae eating in rivers and overfishing in the Atlantic and Pacific ocean.

If this pattern continues, it will result in a vast number of deaths. And many scientists predict that it will start with global collapse of food crops, which could cause widespread starvation. So for all you fish lovers out there, this is really bad news. Here's how it all fits into a bigger picture: There are at least 15,000 fish species living right now that can live on food that the Earth's oceans produce. About 80 percent of those are fish native to the ocean — including the many fish that live in our oceans today. Some are already dying — over the next year, about 75 species are going to the ocean, according to one research group, with another 20 going by the tail end of this year.

So far, the majority of these species remain trapped in the ocean's deep-water trenches and at the bottom far below the surface. If this pattern continues, the majority of these species will be dead by the time the planet does get back on its feet. That includes the Great White shark, which is a key indicator as to the longterm survival of these species, which live in a narrow strip of water, between 1,500 and 400 feet. Over the last 30 years, scientists have identified species like the Great White shark as the fastest-living species on the planet (see this news story that breaks down the different types of shark in great detail). As the Great White shark continues to increase numbers, the other fish-eating seabirds will likely start eating other species — like killer whales, for",1
" Trump Has NEVER Looked So Incompetent; His China Adviser Was Literally Found On Amazon (DETAILS) With every new detail revealing itself about Donald Trump s administration, the humiliation that America is enduring is getting harder and harder to stomach. We have never seen an administration fail so hard from the start, and just when it seems it can get no worse, Trump sets a new  tone for the rest of our country with his unfulfilled campaign promises.

We know that our nation's greatness is not limited to a certain region of the globe. In his heart, Donald Trump thinks of all Americans, not just his supporters: ""I see our greatest blessings coming from people all across our land — not just in Boston or Chicago, not just in New York or Los Angeles. I see our highest hopes and aspirations — if not only for our country, but for our civilization and the world itself."" It is impossible for a man who holds those views to truly believe they would ever get done. Our institutions, our values, and the very fabric of our society depend on that belief, even if it is just something we think we should do a little less often.

""American power is more powerful because it is guided by the will of a nation's citizens. We do not elect leaders — we elect people to uphold that will."" — President John F. Kennedy

On all issues, we Americans have always had people who represented the values that we hold dear, and have worked together toward those values together. A great deal that has divided the country is also what makes America great. We have been at each other's throats for a long time, and now we have a president who thinks we should be fighting each other, like warring families, and for each other over a trivial matter of policy. We can expect that to continue for a long time to come.

So, we need each other. Our values will not only withstand this onslaught — we will thrive. The more we fight our battles, the more our values will shine. This will give us all new confidence in the American system and our democracy, and in the American dream — and for the rest of our lives. It will give us the strength to make the most of ourselves, and to fight for the future of our nation. I promise you, it will be just a little more complicated, but as we come together, so that the American dream may be one that is worth fighting for, we will find it easier to hold each other accountable to our values and to win.

"Is This Why Comey Broke: A Stack Of Resignation Letters From Furious FBI Agents Is This Why Comey Broke: A Stack Of Resignation Letters From Furious FBI Agents Source: Zero Hedge Conspiracy theories have swirled in recent days as to why FBI Director James Comey reopened Hillary's email investigation after just closing it back in July concluding that, although Hillary had demonstrated gross negligence  during her emails fiasco, that she may still be in the clear. And it was only last week that new emails were discovered in the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal. However, after these revelations, there seem to be a lot of people in the FBI saying that perhaps some agents may be getting desperate with the emails that come out, and just want to keep one last shot at Hillary. While nothing in the email scandal is entirely certain, recent reports indicate that senior agents at the FBI may be being told to consider using their resources on Hillary, or at least keeping one last shot at the Clintons. This is where the email investigation comes in. The FBI is said to be so frustrated with the investigation into a major Clinton Clinton Foundation case in its criminal division that agents have recently started to resign after just one week of investigation. It's highly unusual for agents to walk away from their career after just two weeks of investigating or prosecuting a major case, even one that is close to being closed. The FBI's reputation for honesty and hard work has been severely damaged since 2010 by the corruption scandal in the agency involving Bill and Hillary Clinton. The FBI and some members of Congress have come close to impeachment since then, many of them through the use of illegal tactics. Since the FBI is supposed to be focused on the most serious criminal cases, agents have been known to resign over corruption allegations. The FBI has recently taken steps in an attempt to turn the tide by using bribery allegations against powerful agents, including agents at Hillary's State Department and the FBI's Office of Human Resources. These steps appeared to work in the past, but have since backfired, as some agents have already resigned over corruption claims against Hillary. It's no mystery why FBI agents are quitting over corruption, though, although it is unclear why this is the case in Hillary's case. However, agents and agents don't come with all the bells and whistles as to what agents should expect at the FBI. In addition to its very professional and efficient career, the FBI operates with a certain independence, so many agents have come to rely on people in the law enforcement community to guide them through a career in law enforcement. One such person is Michael Breskel, the Chief, who is in charge of the FBI's Office of Criminal Investigative Services. Breskel and his team are supposed to be on the frontlines of looking into and investigating crimes, such as fraud and corruption, against law enforcement and military organizations. In an interview with Business Insider, Breskel mentioned that some agents are also considering",1

It's been over 30 years since the PlayStation in its glorious glory came out and that was when video game consoles were at their peak, but that's all we have yet to do.

Now that you know how it all started we present to you another one of the best retro games ever made. The latest installment of the Nintendo-esque JRPG, Xenoblade Chronicles and Dragon Blade, is a classic that holds a bit of a special place in the hearts of RPG-ers.

For starters you're in an alien world, battling aliens, fighting enemies in the same fashion as in Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenoblade Chronicles has a great combat system that takes a backseat to the combat and strategy aspect of JRPGs where you can turn battles into real-time brawls for the better part of an hour.

The combat itself comes pretty thick and fast, it's one of those battles where you'll have to do several quick attacks to take out an enemy, or you'll just have to hit them with an attack they can't counter. There's also a lot of variety of characters for you to choose from, there are even male and female characters that come with all the options you could wish for: female, boy or girl with different abilities and weapons.

Although the original series had its flaws, it's still one of the most fun to play ever with plenty of nostalgia to pull out. The fighting system is also surprisingly engaging thanks in large part to Dragon Blade. The animation is pretty good here with some cool special moves like those on the right hand side.

I haven't yet tried all of the different characters, just chose a girl and started beating monsters, but those who have played Xenoblade Chronicles before may want to pick up every character as well",1
